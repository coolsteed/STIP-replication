welcom   would somebodi like to move approv of the  minut for the meet of septemb
so move  mr  chairman
without object  they are approv   dino kos  you have the floor
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were distribut a short while ago   the top panel of the first page show the three month u s  dollar libor fix in black and the three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward in red   forward rate had a minor roller coa  ride  first declin immedi after your septemb meet  rise in mid octob as equiti bounc off their octob   low  and then head downward again as the econom data were perceiv as point to econom weak   although much of the declin in forward rate had occur by octob     the day of the washington post articl that heighten expect about a possibl eas in polici  the articl did strengthen market particip    convict about the near term direct of polici  the three  and six month forward rate both are now trade below cash rate   in the treasuri market  the two year note move broad in line with shift expect for offici polici   the yield fluctuat wide  go as low as      percent on octob   and as high as      percent around midmonth   the long end of the curv was affect by mani of the same factor as the short end  though the long sector onc again was probabl affect by hedg of mortgag back secur  mbs  portfolio   the middl panel graph the ten year yield in blue on the left scale and an es  of the durat of outstand mortgag back secur   in red on the right scale   sinc june   mani mortgag had been clu  in the     percent coupon bucket and  with rate fall  these mortgag becam attract to refin  henc the es  durat move even lower from june to septemb   to hedg against that shorten of durat  mbs investor could buy treasuri or fix receiv swap  either of which would have at least some impact on yield level  given the size of mortgag market   as that wave of hedg slow  treasuri yield sudden jump about    basi point in mid octob   some investor  in fact  report overdid their hedg and in mid octob had to sell some of the posit they had just bought   the other factor that had a day to day effect on yield   and even an intraday effect at  e   was the movement in equiti market   the botto   panel show one way of look at this relationship   it graph the     day roll correl between the s p     and the ten year note yield sinc januari        i would note two point   first  for much of this period the correl was modest    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix        negat  but in late      it abrupt turn posit and  though choppi  has on balanc remain posit   second  the correl  which was alreadi high  has been increas this year and is now higher than it was even dure septemb        the intermeet period continu to be difficult in the corpor bond market  invest grade spread   shown in the top left panel on page     remain elev  though they are off the peak they reach a few week ago and also earlier this summer   meanwhil  high yield spread   shown in the top right panel   top       basi point in earli octob befor eas veri slight   the onli other  e that index exceed       basi point was in januari        fix incom investor  whether in invest grade or high yield secur   most of which are measur against the benchmark index   are in risk avers mode  after have taken hit in mani part of their portfolio   anoth way of look at the corpor bond market is to take the invest grade univers and divid the bond into bucket accord to their spread relat to treasuri   the middl panel show three snapshot of  this   as of octob    in             and        the percentag of the invest grade univers trade at up to     basi point over treasuri has been hover at about    percent over these past coupl of year   more than half of the invest grade issu trade at a spread of between     and     basi point two year ago  as shown by the tall red bar   that categori has now declin to about    percent  reflect in part a migrat of credit downward   but perhap the most strike develop is the proport of corpor bond that are still invest grade but are trade at more than     basi point over treasuri   from a small number earlier  that group now make up one fifth of the market  as you can see by the tall   bar on the far right   that higher number reflect most the repric of the debt oblig of some  veri larg issuer  a phenomenon illustr in the bottom panel   the panel depict for the year      to date the spread on the fix incom secur of four of the largest issuer   all four of these compani have seen a doubl or even tripl of their spread at  e   and while they are still invest grade in name  they are price as if they were high yield   becaus of their high and regular issuanc  the bond of these compani compris meaning chunk of mainstream fix incom  benchmark index and are wide own   now  i should note that not all larg issuer have experienc a widen of their spread   for exampl  bank of america is trade at a spread of about     basi point  and citigroup  despit negat public  is at about     basi point   also  while liquid in the corpor bond market has been episod  it has shown some sign of improv recent   meanwhil  liquid in treasuri  mbs  and asset back secur market has general been good throughout the period  final  i should note that the level of outstand nonfinanci commerci paper continu to declin in recent week and is now near    percent lower than it was a year ago   and as we approach year end  the a  p  a  p  spread have begun to widen just a bit  especi for thirti day paper  but at least so far that widen has been much less pronounc than we saw a year ago     turn to europ on page    the top panel graph the three month euro deposit libor fix and three   six   and nine month forward rate   forward rate  which were trade abov cash rate earli in the summer  have been steadili declin as forecast for euro area growth have continu to be reduc   forward rate agreement are now trade below cash rate  and the market wide expect a reduct in the ecb   s offici target rate befor year end  perhap as earli as tomorrow   with europ   s slowdown  euro area corpor spread have also widen  although perhap not by as much as part of our own bond market   in europ the widen has been most pronounc at lower qualiti level  such as the bbb  shown in the   line of the middl panel   meanwhil  issuanc   shown in the bottom  panel   has been fall as in the unit state  but the full credit pictur in europ is more difficult to gaug given the greater relianc on bank financ by european compani   move to japan on page    the market there has been on a bit of a roller coa  ride recent  react to everi littl report about the likelihood   e  size  and speed of the govern   s plan to clean up the bank system   at the  e of your last meet  the bank of japan  boj  had just announc it intent to buy equiti from japanes commerci bank   at first  japanes govern bond  jgb  yield spike higher to about     percent  but they quick retrac that rise as the market began to doubt the econom signific of the boj   s announc  then the cabinet reshuffl and the nomin of a new econom and regulatori czar rais the possibl that stronger action might be forthcom to cleans the nonperform loan problem   while that might have been view as a negat for jgbs  given the prospect of larg govern expenditur  in the short run the effect has been to firm up sen ent that keep money in the bank system is riski   so jgbs again have becom attract as a safe haven   the govern   s plan  when final announc  was view as rather general and a bit less than was hope for or expect   with reform on a slower track again  jgbs continu to declin below   percent   the last  e that jgb yield were below   percent was in novemb        the other develop was the boj   s own announc on octob    that it would increas the pace of it jgb purchas and it current account balanc target   but that was shrug off  as much as anyth  by the marketplac  meanwhil  bank stock fell with the cabinet reshuffl  suggest that investor in these stock at least were take the probabl of reform more serious   the biggest fall in stock price   the bottom panel   was for stock of the three larg bank thought to be at risk of a govern takeov   final  let me say a word on reserv   the chart on page   depict  for each mainten period  averag valu for the three basic compon of our total hold of domest financi asset   that is  for the perman system open market account  long term repurchas agreement  and our short term oper   this chart show actual or project valu for the one year period from februari      through februari       start and end at the season trough for currenc   through juli       currenc growth continu to contribut to a steadi expans of our total   domest financi hold  achiev almost entir with growth in our perman soma hold   from juli to octob  the total size of the portfolio general has been flat  and it even shrank a bit recent   this shrinkag reflect essenti flat currenc growth combin with movement in some autonom factor that ad to reserv balanc  most notic the foreign repo pool   to maintain the total domest portfolio at the appropri level  long term repo were compress  fall from     billion in june to just about    billion in late octob   have the long term repo book allow us to compress our balanc sheet quick without sell asset from soma or engag in longer term drain oper   in upcom mainten period we face season currenc growth  and we expect a resumpt of season adjust currenc growth to more normal level  the result reserv need will be met primarili with a buildup of long term repo  some resumpt of outright soma purchas is also plan  but we will proceed with that veri slowli for the  e be   by the end of the season currenc swing  long term repo will have been built back up to about     billion  a level at which we plan to hold them steadi for a while   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv our domest oper
question for dino
i don   t have a question   i have a comment   i think your handl of the account when you had the reduct in hold was veri well done
the person respons  ms  perelmut  is to my left
you mean you   re deflect the bow    laughter  presid broaddus
i guess i   m a littl surpris  though not a lot  by the strength of the expect that we   re go to move the fund rate down today   look at your first chart  i just want to make sure i understand how that evolv   it appear that expect began to chang some  around octob    and that the   berri articl tend to lock in that view  is that the way you would character it
yes  i think you can see that view had alreadi been move toward an expect of an eas move   but there   s alway the issu of how much convict lie behind   that expect and the degre of dispers around it   to some  extent what berri   s articl did was not necessarili to lock in that expect but to rais the level of convict about it   even if the expect themselv didn   t chang  the level of convict did
he sort of ice it  i guess
i ought to point out that those of us here in washington were quit surpris at the berri articl   we don   t know where it came from   berri is veri care  and he usual wouldn   t write the way he wrote if he didn   t have some convict about the valid of his inform   so my impress is that he had a better sourc than we know  further question for dino   mr  vice chair
move approv of the domest oper
thank you veri much   without object  they are approv   we now move on to     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know  we receiv a consider amount of inform last week after the  book project was final   i am pleas to report that the forecast god  howev briefli  appear to be smile upon us   for the most part  the data were veri close to our expect and requir littl chang to our near term forecast   real gdp was report by the commerc depart in it advanc es  for the third quarter to have risen at an annual rate of     percent  the same as we had project   subsequ data on construct and inventori point to a small upward revis to that figur  on the order of   percentag point  with no implic for q    the broad contour of the labor market report for octob also were in close concord with our project   to be sure  the declin last month in privat payrol of        was a bit larger than we had pencil in  but there were notic upward revis to august and septemb that left the level of employ last month a touch abov our project   the unemploy rate final move up  even if not by quit as much as we had project   taken togeth  the pictur paint by the octob employ data and virtual all of the other labor market indic that we monitor is one of weak   employ gain appear to have stall out after a brief upturn this summer  and recent read on initi claim for unemploy insur suggest there has been littl improv in condit sinc the octob refer week     while the data late last week contain few surpris for us  the same cannot be said for the bulk of the inform that we had receiv sinc the septemb  book   in fact  a notabl featur of the incom data was the uniform with which they surpris us to the downsid   product  consum spend  busi outlay  and foreign activ all came in below our earlier expect   the breadth of these disappoint gave us littl reason to discount the news and led us to mark down consider our forecast through the middl of next year   we project that real gdp will grow at an annual rate of   percent in the current quarter and at a pace of  less than     percent through the second quarter of        a downward revis to growth of rough   percentag point at an annual rate over that period   the direct read on product have not been encourag   after increas through earli summer  industri product is like to have drop about   percent in octob on the heel of small declin in both august and septemb   factori output receiv a sizabl boost through the middl of the year from the effort by firm to stem  further liquid of their inventori   but that impetus now appear to have larg play out  and befor ani improv in the pace of final sale has taken hold  inde  as we move into the fourth quarter  growth of final sale appear to be flag rather than gain momentum   in the busi sector  the recent read on spend for equip and softwar have  on net  been below our earlier expect   though es  outlay for comput have run well ahead of our forecast  shipment of capit good elsewher have been notic softer than we had project in septemb   these are obvious noisi data  and caution is warrant in draw much from their month to   month movement   but when consid togeth with the weak output of busi equip in ip and the downbeat report from firm about their spend plan  we felt a notic downward adjust to our forecast of invest spend was need to balanc the risk to this part of our project   like busi spend  consum outlay also have come in below expect  sale of light motor vehicl in both septemb and octob were down more than we had project   it is difficult to know whether the falloff in sale over the past two month repres onli a payback for the phenomen pace regist in juli and august or a more fundament weaken of demand   we have assum that at least some of the shortfal repres a signal of softer under demand and accord have mark down our project of auto sale and product over the next few quarter   that said  given the econom of the labor contract in this industri  we think that product of a bit under    million unit at an annual rate is about as low as the auto compani will go in the near term  bar some more serious shock to demand or cost   non auto spend also has been disappoint weak of late  real pce exclud motor vehicl was about flat in august and septemb   and while the week data on chain store sale leav a great deal to be desir in term of predict content  their recent weak line up well with the sour of consum sen ent and anecdot report suggest that consum spend has remain sluggish     the onli except to the string of downsid surpris that we experienc over the intermeet period was in hous   start of both singl famili and multifamili hous were far abov the level that we had project for septemb   although the adjust permit data suggest that those figur probabl overst the jump in activ  sale of new and exist home show consider strength as well  and report from the builder have remain veri favor   with the downward adjust that we have made to our project  the economi   not realli break out of the recent pattern of sluggish growth until late next year   still  we do expect sever factor to result in a veri gradual improv  for one  accord to our model  the restrain effect on consum spend of the steep declin in household net worth are at their maximum from now until earli next   year   thereaft  the drag from the wealth effect should begin to abat   next year  feder fiscal polici is project to provid anoth boost to aggreg demand that is onli partial offset by the ongo difficulti at state and local govern   and with the real feder fund rate below the es  rang of it equilibrium  we expect that monetari polici will be support of a gradual pickup in the pace of activ   one other compon of our stori is worth mention   we have assum that there will be a gradual lift of the uncertainti and pessim that current appear to be afflict the busi sector and that are reflect in cautious hire and weak invest   unfortun  we don   t have reliabl measur of busi sen ent  but we have observ that the growth in spend on equip and softwar has been run well below the fundament  at least as quantifi in our model by the cost of capit and expect sale and profit   a pattern consist with report of busi caution and concern   in respons to the recent data and the continu gloomi report  we have held the growth of invest spend below that project by our model into next year  we then allow most of that unusu weak in spend to dissip by late       and this  in turn  give a lift to busi invest and to overal gdp   while this might seem an arcan bit of forecast detail  it matter for our project   and whether one character this featur of the forecast as a regress residu  as busi confid  or as anim spirit  in actual it is a measur of our ignor  not our knowledg  about the factor drive the outlook for busi spend   as usual  there are various risk on both side of the project   we highlight sever of those in the    altern scenario    section of the  book   rather than review those possibl this morn  i thought i would take a few minut to talk about some less like but more consequenti risk in the outlook   specif  what is the risk of renew recess   how like is it that we could enter a deflat   and  by contrast  what are the chanc that we are at the front edg of a much more vigor recoveri than we are current project     let me begin with the risk of recess   as i note earlier  industri product has fallen over the past three month  initi claim for unemploy insur have move up notic  on balanc  in recent week on our altern season  and sale of light motor vehicl drop off sharpli over septemb and octob   we have read these data as suggest a paltri gain in real gdp of   percent at an annual rate in the current quarter   it probabl could go without say that ani reason confid interv around that forecast would includ a negat number   but what about a cumul contract in activ with the depth  durat  and dispers that would qualifi it as a recess   clear  the odd have risen over the past few month   an appreci shock to the economi   for exampl  anoth leg down in the stock market or a spike in oil price   could without too much difficulti trigger a downturn   but bar such a shock  sever factor would seem to be hold down the odd of recess   for one  some of the major imbal that contribut to the contract in activ last year have been reduc or rectifi   if anyth  inventori appear to be on the low side relat to sale  and the steepest contract in capit spend now appear to be behind us   moreov  while pervas caution by busi may be restrain spend  that cautious behavior also is probabl provid some measur of protect against the reemerg of imbal that could later lead to a more pronounc downturn in activ   what about deflat   in our forecast  core pce price increas at an annual rate  of about    percent over the forecast interv   given our es  of the bias in this measur  a read below    percent per annum would constitut actual deflat   as we note in our juli present  your success in stabil inflat  and with it inflat expect  appear to have made price inflat less respons to the output gap than it has been in the past   as a consequ  moder error in our output forecast have relat minor implic for our inflat project   but we also note that mani other factor   for exampl  exchang rate  energi price  and product    are  at  e  import in shape the inflat pictur   stochast simul of our model  which take all of these influenc into account  suggest a    to    percent chanc that core pce inflat could fall below    percent either next year or in        final  we do not believ the outsiz risk to our forecast are wholli on the downsid   what is the possibl that we could be on the verg of a much more vigor expans   one that drive the economi beyond it es  potenti by the forecast horizon   we have made a rather sizabl downward revis to our project on littl more than a month   s worth of inform   moreov  the stock market has shown consider strength in recent week in the face of what we view as disappoint econom data   the anim spirit that appear to be inhibit busi spend could evapor more rapid than we have assum  especi if the stock market were to remain on a pronounc uptrend   therefor  we cannot rule out that  with the real fund rate assum to hold close to zero for the next two year  at some point a much sharper rebound in activ could develop     of cours  anoth upsid risk to the project in real gdp is that the growth of  product remain stronger than we have project   but if that risk were to materi  fa  growth would like also be accompani by lower inflat and less pressur on the economi   s resourc base   as a consequ  the polici implic would be quit differ from those associ with much stronger growth generat sole from the aggreg demand side of the economi   that is  the fund rate  at least for a  e  would need to be below  rather than abov  the baselin    will now continu our present
the contour of the staff forecast for the rest of the world mirror that for the u s  outlook   a downward revis in the near term relat to last  book  follow by some acceler in      and        we are expect the swing in growth abroad on averag to be somewhat damp relat to the u s  pattern   we see foreign growth slow in the current quarter  but exceed u s  growth this quarter and dure the first half of next year  and then strengthen over the remaind of the forecast period  but fall short of u s  growth in        the similar to the u s  path in part reflect the implic of develop in the u s  economi for other region of the globe but in part also reflect our read of signal from within those region of chang aris there   a signific contribut to global slow aris abroad is that from the euro area   a varieti of recent indic  includ industri product and consum and busi sen ent  have persuad us that output growth in the euro area is slow rather than edg up  as we had project in septemb   the disappoint pace of activ in turn is ad to the problem pose by the fiscal stanc in sever of the eu countri  includ franc and germani  and the standard for fiscal deficit set in the stabil and growth pact   weaker than expect activ is reduc tax revenu and ad to the actual govern deficit  includ push the german deficit abov the   percent limit   understand  the nation govern do not wish to take procycl fiscal polici action that would slow their economi further   at the same  e  ecb offici  have stress the  import of fiscal disciplin for each member of the euro area  are face with the choic of eas monetari polici despit rate of inflat through septemb abov their   percent ceil   the debat has rage public in europ  and it now appear that the need structur adjust of some budget will be push off into the futur   nevertheless  the staff forecast incorpor the assumpt that fiscal polici  in the euro area will remain mild contractionari over the forecast period   howev  with the economi soften and futur inflat like to reced  we have incorpor into the baselin forecast the assumpt that the ecb will cut it polici rate by next spring   on balanc  the pictur for the euro area is one where domest spend has fail to establish ani momentum  as invest spend contract further and consum spend expand onli slowli   uncertainti about near term prospect for oil price  the global economi and so export demand  and geopolit tension continu to weigh on confid   fiscal polici is caught between agre medium    term goal and the macro polici need of the near term   and monetari polici for now appear to be on hold   go forward  busi spend should start to expand  with inventori now well below last fall   s peak and capit overhang less of a problem in europ than here   as global oil price come down and euro area inflat drop  consum confid should firm  and clear scope for monetari eas should emerg   but we readili admit that  wherea evid of current weak is clear  our forecast for a rebound next year is far less certain   our outlook for japan is anoth instanc where we have revis down the forecast base import on develop within that economi   some sign of strength earlier in the year reflect demand for japanes export   but that s ulus has so far fail to result in posit invest spend or to boost the pace of consumpt spend  as had been wide expect   in addit  new uncertainti have been creat by the appoint of takenaka as head of the financi servic agenc and by the roller coa  natur of the announc concern his plan for more forc handl of the problem of the financi sector   in light of the repeat postpon of make public specif detail of what will be done  we have put onli veri margin  negat effect from the set of recent polici initi into this forecast   we judg that the near term effect of an ambiti reform  program would be  on balanc  even more negat  but we are not persuad by what has been reveal to date that such a program will in fact be implement   in light of  new data and the diminish prospect for japanes export  we have revis down our outlook for gdp growth in japan but have retain a slight upward trend in growth start by the middl of next year   the emerg economi in asia have been lead the recoveri in global econom activ  and econom expans in that region remain robust   we have adjust down a bit our project for output growth there dure the second half of this year  but that chang larg reflect develop elsewher and some  moder of the veri rapid pace of real output growth record for the first half  domest demand in those economi remain solid  but mani of them are import depend on export  especi from the high tech sector   accord  our baselin forecast is for growth in that region to remain quit strong  outpac that elsewher around the globe   should activ in the unit state or the global economi more general falter  howev  emerg asia is vulner   the result loss in export demand would like undermin domest invest spend as well and result in signific weaker growth of real gdp   canada and mexico remain strong perform on the global scene  and domest demand in their economi has been robust   nevertheless  their tie to the u s  economi  includ through such import sector as auto  are so strong that we see them as larg reflect or share in u s  develop   final  let me mention south america   event there are clear driven by econom and polit develop within the major countri  especi argentina and brazil but also venezuela and other   market reaction to those develop    howev  do depend in part on global appetit for risk and general concern about uncertainti more broad   follow the elect of lula as presid of brazil  market have initi tend to move in a favor direct as his statement and action to date have been reassur   howev  spread on dollar denomin brazilian debt remain abov       basi point  and the interest rate on rough half of the govern s domest debt now stand at    percent   at such interest rate  the debt burden in brazil will eventu overwhelm the economi   both the privat sector and the govern will need to access financi market for sizabl amount of fund in come month   thus it seem prematur to draw ani conclus about whether brazil s govern will avoid a need to restructur the term of some  portion of it debt over the forecast period   it appear that spread would have to declin further and that the currenc would have to strengthen for a truli benign outcom to occur   in argentina  meaning resolut of econom polici and progress on restor growth seem to be on hold until elect are held next march  and even that date for elect is cloud as a disput continu over conduct primari   in the mean   negoti with the imf are proceed in an effort to prevent an actual default by argentina on it oblig to the intern financi institut   the deadlin for avoid a default is the middl of the month  the imf and major creditor govern have assert that they will not approv a flaw program  so some basic issu need to be resolv with argentin offici   that may or may not prove possibl   although we regard the situat in south america as serious  with import implic for the econom and polit stabil of that region  we do not judg the stagnat or low growth in the region as have a major impact on real output growth elsewher   south america is vulner to slowdown in the unit state and the euro area  howev   and a major financi disrupt in brazil could have repercuss on global financi market   that complet our remark   we   d be happi to answer ani question
question for our colleagu
mr  chairman  i have a question for dave   you describ your number on equip spend as   mayb this isn   t the term to use   shot in the dark to some extent   at least that   s how i interpret it  though that   s probabl play fast and loos with what you realli said   but what i   ve been struck by in the  book and in our own forecast is the strength of such spend  particular in the comput area  the actual number for the third quarter involv someth like a    percent growth rate for comput expenditur  and a    percent growth rate is embed in the forecast   that is so at odd with what busi peopl tell us they   re do and the downbeat natur of their comment   i   m go to talk a bit about   some meet we   ve had with softwar execut and offici from larg compani in refer to their plan for equip spend next year   we don   t hear anybodi tell us that they   re do much of anyth   mayb that just mean that there   s such a huge amount of comput equip out there that the replac that   s go on is produc those figur right now  given the year over year contrast with        but even the languag in the  book has a more hope cast to it than what i hear from anybodi i talk to who is out there actual spend money for busi equip
i   d say a few thing about that   first of all  there is some question about the data themselv   our industri product measur of the output in that area don   t suggest as much strength as is includ in the m  data  manufactur    order  shipment  and inventori  that are use to construct the nation incom account and that i mention in my brief   that   s one reason for our lean in the direct we did  we think mayb that m  data will begin to show someth that is more in line with what we   re see on the product side  so there   s some question about what exact has happen   two  i think the replac demand stori is veri import on the comput side   there are a lot of comput  and they depreci veri rapid   there has been some extens of the servic live of such equip over the recess  with compani make do longer with what they have   but onc that lengthen stabil  we will see an uptick again on the replac side   and that is an import factor in our outlook
but when you ask a question about that  everybodi in busi say that the equip is just fine and we   re make it do more than we ever made it do befor
right   still  it is true that a lot of unit are be ship   despit the fact that one hear those stori  there is actual evid of sale   number of box are leav factori  and somebodi is purchas those item
incident  the stori about the lengthen out of the  e firm are employ these piec of equip is import onli if the rate of chang remain stabl  those stori can veri readili be consist with a dramat declin in how quick the lengthen stop   and that will engend  as dave say  a pop in the output number   so i think there are problem on both side of this rhetor
the busi communiti seem to be a littl sloppi in the way they evalu their invest spend   and i think there are serious question as to what census   with those m  form   rememb where the m  form origin   they are fill out by plant manag at the plant level on the shipment liter go out of the plant   those are veri hard data   the onli problem with the aggreg data is that census adjust those number  and it   s never terribl obvious how they do it
i   d just mention one other thing   obvious  it   s an area of veri substanti price declin  too   so capit spend budget in nomin term  which is what we most hear about  are weaker than what we would translat into real term   none of this  i think  complet resolv the tension that you are point out here  presid     that   s whi in this forecast in particular we move more in the direct of a weaker project of invest spend for a longer period of  e than might be suggest by a read of our model   but whether we   ve done enough of that  i don   t know   in one of the altern simul we present in the  book we show an exampl of what would happen if we   got no improv in invest spend over the cours of      relat to what we   ve alreadi had in       along with some ongo weaken on the consum side   obvious  that   s a much weaker pictur if we accept those assumpt fulli
dave  in the near term outlook in the  book  especi through the middl of next year  inventori are veri lean   as a matter of fact  i think the inventori   sale ratio reach histor low level   have you given ani thought to how larg and how like the upsid risk to the forecast might be if inventori were actual larger than those assum
you   re absolut right that our forecast  in essenc  is predic  on an ongo declin in the target inventori sale ratio   we would expect that ratio in some  sens to continu to get lower and lower over  e as busi manag inventori better   and quit frank  our inventori project actual has inventori invest a littl stronger than a liter read of our model would suggest becaus we think those model don   t incorpor the more rapid pace of adjust of inventori to target ratio than use to be the case   the model  obvious  are es  on the basi of histor data that involv slower adjust  so we think there could be some risk that we   re too strong on the inventori side   but if we were to get a more pronounc move back to an equilibrium or target inventori sale ratio in relat short order  i think we could see anoth lift to activ similar to what we saw earlier this year   so we could get anoth pop come from that   busi report in fact that they   re run with relat lean inventori   but i think it would take a posit sale surpris at this point to actual move them in the direct of want to add to inventori more aggress   either that or perhap some sign that commod price were pick up more   signific   busi seem to be fair comfort  given their degre of caution  run with relat lean inventori   but as you know  this is an area of the forecast in which we have not alway cover ourselv with distinct   i   m talk in term of our abil to predict either the inventori themselv or minor chang in the sale outlook  which obvious get amplifi in their effect on the overal forecast through the inventori channel   so i think there certain could be some upsid surpris there as well
over the past year of presum recoveri  employ as measur by the establish survey is down slight  i believ   there   s been negat employ growth over that year   yet the household survey has employ up about a million  at least enough to hold the unemploy rate fair constant   this seem like an  unusu larg diverg in those two seri   have you look into what is go on
yes   actual  there are quit frequent veri larg discrep between the two seri   as we talk about at the board meet on monday  it   s quit rare to see them line up veri well over ani consider period of  e   so we   re alway tri to explain whi one is stronger than the other  usual not too success   our basic view is that the establish survey is probabl give a better read on the current state of labor market   it appear to line up much better with the weak that seem to be evid in initi claim for unemploy insur  with percept by household of the state of the labor market  and with busi report on how easi or difficult it is to find worker   so we feel reason comfort take most of our signal from the establish rather than the household survey
in recent month  hous start have come in abov expect fair persist   is there a possibl that we are underes  the degre of immigr as we did in the previous decad   in other word  the boom of      through       which put the expans of the u s  economi well abov that of other nation  explain the strength of our immigr   our economi is still run ahead of them   is it plausibl that we   re miscalcul the strength of our popul growth and henc the growth of household
that certain is possibl   i actual don   t know whether or not our expert would think that we   ve been miss someth recent on immigr   as for the surpris strength in hous activ over the past few month  i would just note that household format are extrem elast with respect to overal econom condit   we probabl would not view immigr as an import determin factor over short period of  e   so  if we were to analyz our forecast error  i don   t think we would be give much weight to unexpect strong immigr to explain  let   s say  the experi of the last three or four month   now over a longer period of  e  obvious  under demand would be a factor as it has been in the past when the sourc of the problem was a popul mis es    so it certain would line up in that direct
could i comment on this issu   the immigr expert are virtual all in agreement that if a countri has a toughen up of legal immigr  which we   ve had sinc septemb     illeg immigr just increas accord   so the likelihood  therefor  of immigr be stronger and creat more hous demand than the offici data would indic i think is greater
could i ask dave a question   suppos it   s true that there is extra immigr   wouldn   t that tend to show up in the employ survey and not the household survey
it could  if it were actual measur
it could  but it won   t show up
it won   t show up in the household survey  we know that   but whether it show up in the employ survey is not clear to me
it depend on whether they affect that survey to a substanti extent
so it   s hard to see how it would resolv bob   s question
i wasn   t rais the issu in term of bob   s question   i was rais a second question relat to the demand for hous in a veri broad sens  incident  with the veri latest revis in the third quarter  what is the nonfarm product  number now
we   d now be look at a third quarter figur of about   percent
four point zero percent
my question aros befor the hous discuss start  but let me just comment briefli on hous   part of what may be go on in that sector is the    tear down     phenomenon   a lot of hous start come from tear down perfect good hous in  neighborhood like my own and replac them with mcmansion   i think we see that happen in the close in suburb all over the countri   i   ve heard that it may account for perhap           hous start on a nation basi  which is realli an enorm number   in other word  these start are not produc new unit
yes   we do get demolit data on a veri delay basi  and it is true that  if we took the chang in the stock of hous  which unfortun is tie to the popul survey   it   s the so call vacanc rate survey   and we use the gross addit  which includ mobil home obvious  we would in the past have gotten a fair signific  amount of implicit net scrap   the most recent data don   t show that   they show veri littl  so there is either a statist discrep here  or someth differ is go on about which we will not get a real understand i guess until we see the      census of hous  which will be publish in         laughter
in the pre fomc brief  at the end of the chart and tabl  chart   list four item that are affect the longer run outlook   the fourth one is that    the gloom that current is a restrain influenc on busi expans will gradual lift next year      i have the sens that we are reli more on that than we usual do   follow along from cathi   s question  it seem to me that we know about a lot of individu sector where there   s realli a great deal of retrench take place   obvious structur are one  we   re not go to see a boom in structur   it will be quit a while befor we will see that sector and other such as air transport  airlin  or aircraft come back  they are all go to be in a retrench phase for a long  e   we   ll see park aircraft brought back from the desert befor we see the build of new aircraft   power plant construct seem to have been revis down  becaus of the scale of power plant  the construct involv a rather substanti amount of invest   it seem to me that  if we   re wrong about this assess on the gloom lift  then clear the economi is go to be a good bit slower than we   d like   reli on that      anim spirit    is what keyn   call it   as the basi of the forecast concern me   i understand whi it is in there  and i don   t have anyth better to offer  but i am veri uneasi that that   s where we are
let me just say a coupl of word about that   one is that some of the thing you mention in term of factor that are like to be weigh on invest are incorpor in this forecast   you may have seen on chart   in that present that we indic we   re expect aircraft invest   for exact the reason you laid out   to be veri weak throughout the forecast period  and that   s true in manufactur as well   we   re expect ongo declin in invest in that sector and growth in capac that for a second year will be the weakest on record sinc we have been construct capac measur   so that process is oper in the background in our forecast  but on the broader issu of reli on this gloom to lift  one reason i want to rais that in my present was that in fact it is quantit import in our outlook   inde  if we were to hold the residu on our invest equat at the level record over the last coupl of year  we   d have the unemploy rate basic hold constant over this forecast period rather than come down as it     obvious  a consequ would be somewhat lower inflat as well   so it is not an inconsequenti featur of the forecast  whether we call it anim spirit or busi confid or someth els   of cours  it   s possibl that our model is misspecifi   that there   s some unidentifi featur drive invest that we   re not captur well and that could persist throughout the forecast period  the way i   m look at the forecast is that the anim spirit compon of it is  diminish over  e   i say that simpli becaus  if one look at the residu in those equat  big gap don   t last forev  they tend to fade away   so in some sens we   re reli less and less on anim spirit in this forecast   but that expect diminish is an import featur in the   pickup that we   re show here   and i don   t have much more to offer on that   unlik the household sector  where we get some independ measur of sen ent or confid against which we can judg develop  we realli don   t have statist measur to reli on as to whether sen ent is improv or diminish on the busi side
this follow up on bill   s comment from a littl differ direct   in light of the anim spirit discuss  the altern scenario in the  book label    lower fund rate    seem to produc a fair op ist outcom   i don   t know if you adjust your model or just allow it to run in that instanc to get the reduct in unemploy and the pickup in growth   my concern is  given the overhang in capit and the capac issu  whether that is realli a veri reason outcom to project   in the context of a weaker scenario  perhap we would find less of an effect from that action
that particular scenario make no differ assumpt about the way anim spirit evolv than   the baselin forecast   so  the strengthen in that simul   from the    basi point reduct in the fund rate relat to the baselin   oper through all the usual channel by which we assum monetari polici work   it work through interest sensit spend  more hous  and more capit equip spend   it work through a somewhat higher stock market and a somewhat lower dollar   obvious  if you thought for some reason that the chang in the fund rate would not be oper through those channel
or not oper as strong through them
or not as strong through those channel  you would want to temper the result there   now  i don   t believ there   s necessarili ani strong reason for think   that the interest sensit of spend at this point would be veri differ than what is pick up in the histor averag   while we talk about capit overhang  and inde there are some sector in which capit overhang clear remain  we do have      trillion worth of invest occur in this economi right now   that must mean there are mani peopl who are still on the margin and for whom a lower cost of capit might    crowd in    a bit more spend   a lower cost of capit might allow some further improv in the structur of both household and busi balanc sheet   we   re certain not see ani difficulti get more hous construct   there appear to be construct worker  there is land to be develop  there is lumber to be use   that channel seem to be oper   so  i   m not uncomfort with that baselin   but i recogn that one could be concern about whether it overst or underst the sensit of the economi  to polici chang go forward
i have a question for   about tabl a in the extens of the  book forecast   on price  you have the core pce declin through      and then tick up onli slight after that   it   s realli an extraordinari perform   if we were concern about inflat at ani point over that period   i was wonder if you had run ani scenario to see what it would take for us to be concern about inflat again over this extend period of  e
well  to me one of the simplest way to think about this is in term of the probabl of deflat  which i mention in my brief   mean that we get inflat rough   percentag point below our current forecast   as i said  the model suggest that those odd are somewher in the    to    percent rang   i think the odd are reason symmetr  so one could expect a    to    percent probabl that inflat could be   percentag point higher  which would be around   percent   now  whether one would consid that to be an inflat   problem or not  i leav for you as the policymak to judg   but that give you the sens that there are big confid interv around our forecast  by the way  i would certain encourag you not to think of those extend  book simul as forecast   they are in some sens construct use the model   but our confid interv around our forecast for      is huge   so if you were to ask what the confid interv is around a forecast out to       i   m not sure the univers is wide enough   laughter  but it is possibl to generat scenario that would includ a notic deterior of inflat  certain over the near term  it seem as if a real breakout on the upsid in the inflat outlook would take some do   it   s not quit so easi to see  especi given how stabl inflat expect are  that we could get serious eros in what peopl think the fomc   s longer term inflat object are and  therefor  that inflat could deterior a great deal over the shorter term forecast period we   re show in the  book   there is certain alway the possibl  a central bank can alway generat inflat if it tri hard enough   but i   d say it   s difficult to see that be an issu over the next eight quarter
further question   who would like to start off our roundtabl   presid parri

the third quarter suggest this   but excess in telecommun remain high  and measur of current manufactur strength and industri product are not over comfort   fiscal polici  embodi in the partial expens provis for capit good  may be accommod  but my contact have question whether ani tax provis might make them will to spend absent rise demand or some real indic of a new technolog trend of some valu  frank  further eas in monetari polici might not trigger spend either  though it probabl wouldn   t hurt   thus  i think it   s possibl that capit spend won   t increas at the rate embodi in either the  book forecast or our own   so to return to alic in wonderland   will the jam realli be there   moreov  now even the bread of the forecast   the base of  consum spend   is in question with the recent falloff in broad retail sale  spend on auto  and confid indic   it seem clear that consum spend will weaken consider in q   particular relat to q   and then grow relat modest in the first half    of        or at least that   s our forecast and the  book   s as well   and at midyear  econom activ begin to turn up in the forecast in a substanti way  reflect increas corpor stabil  rise job prospect if not job growth  and rise equiti market   clear these two forecast  one for busi invest and one for consumpt  feed on one anoth   if one is gain strength  the other come along   but the revers is true as well   busi won   t invest if consum won   t buy  and consum won   t buy if they don   t have job   the key question here is  what start the process   given the situat in the rest  of world  help is not on it way from the extern sector   that leav onli two major exogen driver of the forecast outsid of an increas exogen in anim spirit   accommod fiscal and money polici   at their current level  are these enough  fiscal polici in the form of further tax cut is like to be too littl too late  at least for consum spend   as i note earlier  perhap a chang in tax provis will be a shot in the arm to invest spend  mayb not   then there is the issu of whether monetari polici realli is accommod   the bluebook analysi suggest that it is increas less so   credit spread suggest that financ is harder to come by for more industri   and even the  book forecast  sn   t show much increas growth for interest sensit sector  at least in the near term   polici has to prime the pump of this drag recoveri  but i think it may not be pois to do so without some further chang   this may be riski  as we   ve discuss in the past  but the greater risk may be leav thing the way they are   i don   t know about the rest of you  but even if this forecast is right on the mark  anoth year of rise unemploy  most of the year to wait befor gdp grow at potenti  and inflat that fall to the low   percent rang suggest to me that we   re not do enough
thank you  mr  chairman   the inform we have suggest that our district economi  like other region economi around the countri  soften in octob from an alreadi quit moder pace over the summer month   some of this weak in our region reflect unusu special circumst   we do a month survey of district condit  and it indic that retail sale and shopper traffic both drop off veri sharpli in the month of octob   that almost certain reflect the sniper shoot that kept peopl in the bal or washington richmond corridor away from mall dure much of that month   but there had alreadi been sign of some slippag in retail sale earlier  in septemb   and the survey i mention suggest that activ is more sluggish now than it was sever month ago in a number of servic sector industri  especi in the northern part of our region  in manufactur  accord to our survey inform  factori output held steadi in octob  but new order declin in both septemb and octob   in our region as in your  cathi  the anecdot inform for the most part is pretti bearish   there are some bright spot  though  in the inform we   ve receiv most recent   one particular interest comment i heard was made to me by the chairman of the csx railroad  who simpli becaus of the natur of his busi has a broad rang of contact across a number of manufactur and other industri   he told me that his sens from the convers he has been have is that  bar further big negat shock  the recoveri is pois to acceler by earli next year   so at least somebodi has some sens of posit anim spirit out there   as a number of peopl have mention for their district  hous activ still show no sign of deceler   so that   s the news on the region  on the nation economi  for most of this year it seem reason to think of the economi as move forward with a relat small and more or less stationari output gap    especi sinc the middl of the year  aggreg hour have been flat  and the growth of demand has been pretti much match by the continu strong growth of product   in this situat  at least until recent  i thought it was plausibl to expect that with the real fund rate near zero  dispos person incom grow at a reason strong pace  and profit show some sign of gradual increas  an adjust process was in place   and it seem like to me that  given  e  this process would help overcom the reluct of busi firm to invest  elimin the output gap  and put the economi back on a solid and reason balanc growth track   the inform we   ve receiv in the last sever week  of cours  has call that view into question   after have been veri mix for most of the year  the latest data are speak more uniform  and they suggest that the output gap is  if anyth  grow rather than shrink   the growth of consum spend has deceler   the expect rebound of busi invest now look further off than we had hope   all of this  of cours  is reflect in your forecast     which suggest that the output gap is like to grow through about the middl of next year befor it final begin to narrow   so the downsid risk in the outlook clear has increas  and i recogn that   that said  and i may be the lone voic in the wilder  i think we need to be care not to exagger the increas in the downsid risk or to overreact to it   i think monetari polici  and here i would disagre with you a bit  cathi  is still quit s ul  moreov  it is expect to remain s ul for some  e  and that expect is hold longer term interest rate down  product growth  as i think you mention     is like to remain robust for the forese futur   that may restrain both job growth and wage increas temporarili  but it should help to increas corpor cash flow and equiti valuat and provid at least intern financi resourc  which at some point  hope not too far down the road  may help busi   firm overcom their reluct to invest   you also mention that the stock market was show some sign of stabil  some of the imbal that we   ve been grappl with appear to be diminish   and while i know there are a lot of difficulti on the dock  as bob parri has describ veri well  that kind of longer run uncertainti may have been resolv to some extent   further   and i think especi import for monetari polici   while we may be experienc some further disinfl  current it   appear to be pretti mild  so i think we should take the  e to assess the persist of the recent slow in the recoveri and it like cumul impact on the output gap befor we react to it   i know  of cours  that the market and the broader public expect us to reduc the fund rate this morn  consequ  if we didn   t do that   if we disappoint those expect   there would be some  short term cost   but i believ there is also a longer term risk that ad addit monetari s ulus now to what we alreadi have in place could creat doubt that we will be prepar to revers cours prompt when the economi eventu begin to strengthen
thank you  mr  chairman   our recent busi advisori council meet wasn   t near as downbeat as cathi     s  and mayb it   s becaus at least one member who didn   t show up was from a compani in bankruptci    laughter   the general sen ent of the group was sum up by one of the particip who said that the economi has found the bottom and now it   s onli a question of how rapid momentum build   there was also a general consensus that equiti market have seen their low and it   s onli a question of how slowli or how rapid the market strengthen   sever express the belief that depress equiti market have been more of a factor in reduc job hop than has the soft in local labor market   in fact  some report recent firm in their local labor market    regard invest plan  two report that they had taken off hold on invest spend sinc the previous advisori council meet in the summer   anoth said that his compani believ that this was a good  e for bottom fish for equip bargain and for depress or bankrupt compani that are for sale   one specif report on invest spend  from an owner of what i think are now eight mcdonald restaur in kentucki  was that the corpor is shift emphasi to upgrad exist store rather than open new store  mcdonald announc that    billion will be spent in the next coupl of year on new technolog for it store   one of the item mention was radio frequenc remot order take devic   we found from director that bob    applebe   s  wendi   s  and kroger   s  all district compani  also are spend more on technolog to improv their oper  as would be expect  supplier to the residenti construct sector are requir mandatori weekend work through the end of the year   in commerci construct  one contact assert that compani that are capabl of build to design and turn key project are get contract while pure generic construct contract is  in his word     dead in the water      a maker of upper end tool report that both domest and foreign order in septemb and octob were the best so far this year   from the banker on our board of director we heard that commerci loan demand and new applic have pick up recent   but member of our busi advisori council said that this may reflect onli the fact that even medium and small compani are now spread their busi over three or four bank rather than reli on a singl lender as they had in the past  a manufactur of packag food said that catalog and internet sale have strengthen  with a notic pickup in item consid to be holiday season type of good   most import to this director  corpor order for custom and employe appreci gift were   come in strong  this revers the dramat drop they saw in sale of such item this  e last year  regard corpor earn  one of our director who sit on three industri board   ken  diebold  and sherwin    report that all three had strong third quarter earn and that their share price also were recov   this led our research assist to turn to their bloomberg termin  and they found that thirti nine s p     compani are headquart in the district  twenti eight report improv earn for the quarter  and their share price general have risen from earlier low   a director who has an invest manag firm said that after a dismal septemb he thorough dread the come of octob   but in the end it was the best octob in his memori   in what i take to be a pure signal of inflat  he also report that compani are boost retain and meet fee for director by as much as    percent   no product there    laughter   i suggest that he take up the topic of reserv bank director fee with my successor    laughter  regard nation and global issu  i continu to believ that the near term is domin more by fear and uncertainti than it is by ani kind of risk and reward consider  so i have noth new to add  i want to return to and extend some of the remark i made at the last meet about secular trend in manufactur  especi nondur good manufactur  that i believ will overshadow ani cyclic trend one might be tri to find   forti year ago    kenneth galbraith said that the  e would come when   percent of the popul would produc all the thing that we need   in that regard he may have been correct  but it depend on one   s view of what we actual need versus what we want   he didn   t say much about the thing we might want   he made that statement about product trend not becaus he thought all the item   were go to come with label that said    made in china    but just on the basi of extrapol the trend in technolog and product  in septemb i travel to a small town that i   ve visit previous  and there were three new store  with name i didn   t recogn  within walk distanc of each other   i went into one of them and pick an item off the shelf  and there was no price label on it  so i ask the clerk how much it was   she said one dollar   so i pick up anoth item  a larger quantiti of a similar product  and ask how much it was   and she said one dollar   i said i didn   t get it   she said everyth in the store is one dollar alway   i said     cool       laughter   this is price stabil  but i ask how that could be   whi would anyon buy the smaller quantiti instead of the larger quantiti for the same price of one dollar   express some frustrat with my inabl to grasp basic econom  she explain the qualiti differ between the two but repeat that everi item in the store alway cost the same amount   after make purchas there i went to the next store and ask     is everyth in this store the same price      and the clerk said that everyth  in the store cost the same  which is not exact what i ask but it was close enough   the same was true in the third store  liter everyth in the store was the same price  the addit wrinkl to this stori that made it realli curious to me is that i was in canada   those were canadian dollar peopl were spend   i went back and report this to our economist  and one of them who also goe to ontario frequent was curious about it  too  he found a store in northern ohio call dollar tree that work the same way   he said that exact the same item that were price at one canadian dollar were price at one u s  dollar  which tend to suggest that the actual cost to manufactur these product have fallen to a trivial level compar with all the other valu ad involv   that suggest  among other thing  that   the labor compon of what we call nondur good is go to continu to vanish to such a point that intern competit will no longer be a factor  this give rise to what i consid the rubbermaid effect   that is  there come a point where the labor compon is so small that  as one manufactur put it  labor could be free in china and china still could not compet   that   s becaus the chines manufactur can   t get five blue bucket to a south side omaha store tomorrow morn  but that store know how mani blue bucket it sold today and local manufactur can get replac there quick  and this is happen not just in the nondur good area   a steel manufactur whose firm is headquart in our district said that over the past ten year the averag increas in labor product  output per hour  at his firm was   percent per year   that mean they can produc the same amount of steel with less than half the workforc they use ten year ago   a member of our small busi advisori council who has a print busi said that he now produc the same volum   though i don   t know how he measur his volum   with half the labor forc he employ some year ago and he   s still oper at onli    percent of capac   in his view  his competitor overinvest in technolog   all this not onli affect what we think about the labor market data  but over  e as this trend continu we   re also go to have to think differ about the price statist  at least for certain type of good   i say that becaus of what i saw as veri clever tie in sale in order to price all item at one dollar   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman  i   ll report on develop in our  district  but my comment will be less color   condit in the third district have deterior somewhat sinc our last meet on septemb      indic suggest that the paus we saw in the region   s manufactur sector this summer has worsen   the general activ   index in our busi outlook survey move from a slight posit read in septemb to a signific negat read of minus      in octob   this was onli the second negat record sinc that index began recov at the begin of the year  the index of shipment and new order also turn negat  although the deterior was less sever and the result differ by sector   durabl good produc general report fall demand for their product  while nondur good produc  includ food product compani and apparel maker  report some increas   our respond also told us that they have reduc somewhat their product plan for the fourth quarter sinc their custom have trim their own expect  retail have also express concern that the fourth quarter will be weak   sale of  general merchandis have been declin   the sale index of our pennsylvania retail survey fell again in the third quarter for the second consecut quarter declin   this diffus index indic that almost    percent more of the survey firm report lower sale compar with a year ago than report increas sale   area retail tell us that sale remain sluggish in  octob as well   some attribut weak apparel sale to unseason warm weather  but the soft was widespread across merchandis categori   area auto dealer report that sale  declin in both septemb and octob despit the continu financ incent on some model   retail note that they are trim spend on acquisit of new space  renov  and equip   and commerci real estat activ in general remain anem  labor market condit in the district remain weak  while the tri state unemploy rate is still below that of the nation  averag     percent in the third quarter  employ in our region fell slight   our bls respond report that they continu to cut manufactur job in octob   one hope sign come from the recent complet manpow employ   outlook survey  which indic that employ in our three state do plan to add worker in the fourth quarter   also  our contact in employ agenc tell us that they expect healthier labor market in our area after the turn of the year   it remain to be seen whether that will inde be the case  residenti construct continu to be the region   s bright spot   hous permit have been rise sinc spring   real estat lend has continu to rise  and some bank indic that the pace of refinanc has acceler  turn to the nation scene  i believ accumul evid suggest that the recoveri has either stall or slow consider sinc our last meet   it just has not develop ani traction   moreov  activ in certain sector  manufactur in particular  has declin   over the past six month  job growth has averag onli        per month  and the growth in the servic sector  which is general slower dure the earli stage of recoveri  has been even weaker than averag this  e   initi claim for unemploy insur have remain at high level   invest is weak  and the order and shipment data suggest weak will continu in  the fourth quarter   inventori are low in mani sector  but firm are show littl inclin to start rebuild them  enabl by accommod monetari polici  consum have buoy the recoveri   low interest rate have sustain consum spend on hous and durabl   refinanc have put  money in consum    pocket  and research by the philadelphia staff suggest that this refinanc activ has had a signific impact on expenditur for consum durabl   in addit  the increas in hous price has rais the valu of collater use to support home equiti lend  and that has enabl homeown to bring forward some of their consumpt  the consum continu to be the essenti part of the outlook   howev  there is some danger   that  if refinanc or home price appreci slow  the strength of consum spend will subsid   inflat remain subdu  even oil price have declin in recent week   moreov  core inflat is forecast to declin over the next year or so  make the recoveri more vulner if there is a negat shock  the committe can do littl to bring invest on line more quick   uncertainti over geopolit issu will have to ebb and busi will have to gain confid in the recoveri befor they begin to make the commit implicit in renew invest and hire   the question is whether the committe can and should do anyth to buoy the consum in order to sustain the recoveri until invest begin show real gain  one issu discuss at our last meet was whether an eas of polici would  exacerb imbal in the economi   in particular in the hous market   that would have to be work out in the futur   i myself share that concern   but some recent work at our bank suggest that relat moder growth in household invest dure the preced expans leav the potenti for addit invest in that sector today  without fear of grow imbal   as i   ve said at previous meet  i have concern about both tri to fine tune the economi and the possibl of overshoot   i   ve argu for patienc  say that we should wait to see if the polici we had alreadi appli was suffici   but weak data have  continu to come in  and posit sign in some sector have begun to revers themselv   i   m now lose patienc    laughter   perhap it   s  e to consid anoth dose of polici medicin  thank you
presid  n
let me start with recent chang in district econom condit  which general have been modest   and not all of them have been negat   the hous sector   continu to be a veri bright spot  and even home price at the upper end of the market seem to be continu to move fair rapid   labor market are steadi  i would say  but not strong  manufactur appear to be stabl   we particip in a survey with the minnesota depart of trade and econom develop  and i at least was somewhat surpris by the report   i wouldn   t say the tone was one of op   but most manufactur seem to feel that their busi were stabil and that the outlook  at least for the second half of the year  wasn   t too bad   now  that survey was complet in septemb  and condit may have deterior sinc then   but that was the messag we got at the  e  i talk with a coupl of senior execut from larg firm in the paper industri who pretti much confirm that sens of the busi outlook   certain  they weren   t in despair   i would character those convers as report that busi was tough but not aw   it was possibl to make money   they were profit but  of cours  not as profit as the busi execut would have like   a similar convers with a coupl of senior execut in the publish busi had the same tone and tenor  consum spend has been mediocr at best recent  although one remain bright spot outsid of hous is tourism activ  which has been pretti good dure the fall  and report earli inquiri for next summer have been fair strong   final  i would say that commerci construct has taken anoth turn down  as far as the outlook for the nation economi is concern  i don   t have a signific altern to the  book forecast to suggest  but i will distinguish between what i think i know and what i think i don   t know   i   m veri uncertain about whether growth in real gdp will pick up next quarter or some  later next year  it may not happen until      or perhap beyond that   what i think i know  or at least what i   m less uncertain about  is that product is on a   strong and favor trend  inflat is low and like to stay low  and inflationari expect are low and like to stay low   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my wal mart contact tell me that wal mart   s expect for sale growth have been revis downward   he   s now expect sale to grow at the low end of the   to   percent rang   growth in same store sale for store open a year or more came in at   percent for septemb  which was particular disappoint given that the comparison was with septemb a year ago   he said the weak seem to have start in the second week of juli and has been go on long enough that it look as if sale growth has been downsiz   i ask him particular about total sale   he said that wal mart   s squar footag is grow at a   percent annual rate   appar they   ve been on that track for some  e   but the deceler in total sale match the deceler in same store sale  they don   t get a differ pictur on that basi  he note that the compani is see a more pronounc mid month paycheck cycl  mani peopl who shop at wal mart are do so after they receiv their paycheck   when compani analyst see a more pronounc cycl  they interpret that as mean that peopl are more liquid constrain and are delay outlay until they get their paycheck   moreov  this pattern is evid even in expenditur on food   he didn   t know quit what to make of that becaus ordinarili food purchas are spread rather even over the month  he also said that one cannot underes  the impact of the dock strike  though in his view wal mart was better prepar than most other firm   he indic that the dock worker are work at about    percent of their usual speed  which i think would fit with what bob parri was say earlier  and that the backlog will not be clear until late novemb perhap at   the earliest   noth that get on ship in asia now is like to arriv in store on schedul   in his view there   s a lot of season merchandis that will end up either be sold at distress price or be put in storag by some retail to be sold next year   i don   t know whether that   s go to distort the inventori number   the categori affect includ electron  apparel  shoe  toy  christma decor  and that sort of thing  my contact at j b  hunt truck said that the truck busi come from the west coast is more or less back to normal  though that   s not realli consist with what bob report  to describ the overal economi my contact use term like    wishi washi        has no vital      and    is tentat      he report that june was the strongest month this year and that busi is  slower now than in june  wherea usual his peak period is in the septemb octob  e  frame   so  he   s had a less than normal season chang in the recent period   the retail he talk to  includ target and wal mart  are not all that op ist   he use an express i hadn   t heard befor  comment    as they say in arkansa  not much pumpkin     whatev that mean    laughter  my fedex contact report that his compani has seen a signific soften in busi sinc late septemb   on some day in octob express volum was actual below prior year level   the shipper fedex peopl talk to expect a less busi holiday season than previous anticip  they expect the holiday peak to be less extrem than usual   he also emphas that the west coast dock strike is have larger effect than expect   of cours  a fair amount of good are be ship by airfreight at substanti abov normal cost   item like auto part and so forth that can be ship at these higher price on a temporari basi   he mention especi that their intern busi is strong come into the unit state and that intra asia busi is also strong  while u s  export are still on the weak side   he said there   s a   distinct soften in the busi   the slowdown is not a dramat     oh my god     type of event  but it is a notic soften   as with up they  too  are expect a less robust peak in their busi in late novemb and decemb  my up contact said that his compani has now reduc it      calendar year forecast  asian busi is current boom becaus of the dock strike  and up   not see an end to that until late this year  up is expect fair good growth in asia  both within asia and between asia and europ   plan for further reduct in their workforc have not yet been announc   so  as with all these comment  you should not talk to outsid about them   but he say they expect to furlough crew member or to introduc earli retir packag   that reflect a reevalu of their prospect for next year  which involv have to cut their budget as compar with the      budget by   percent   they do not plan to put special aircraft in place for the holiday season  they often hire plane and crew on a temporari basi   their ground busi was actual down     percent in the third quarter this year in comparison with the previous year   he said it was the first year to year declin in his twenti eight year in the busi   up capit expenditur are at      billion this year and plan expenditur for next year are      billion   they are expect to buy twelv new aircraft  down from the fourteen origin plan   they would have prefer to reduc the number to ten  but the natur of their contract with the manufactur make it too expens to cancel the contract   i ask him what up think was regard the effect on the compani should there be a war with iraq   he said that they have stand arrang with the militari for the militari to take up plane for airlift need  and the same is true with fedex   he note that there are three stage to this process   they are current in stage one where up is provid one wide bodi to the militari on an ad hoc basi  typic on weekend when the plane is not use anyway   so at   this point there   s not too much effect   he indic that even if they went to stage three  where the maximum number of plane would be taken by the militari  up would be abl to keep it domest network go   the plane would come out of the intern network   howev  he said restrict on fli probabl would be so sever should they get to that stage that the domest network would be most down  when i read part   of the  book  i was struck by the fact that indic after indic and data for sector after sector   with the except of hous   seem to be come in at a disappoint level or somewhat below expect   it made me think about the old fashion wind up alarm clock   you wind it up  and when the alarm first goe off  the bell ring vigor  and after a while the sound just tail off   in term of econom activ  the bell is still ring  but it   s not veri loud or vigor anymor  in think about the current situat  i ask myself this question   is monetari polici realli expansionari   there was a long discuss of this type of issu thirti year ago in the  whole debat of aggreg versus interest rate   i think we all decid at that  e that interest rate  of cours  reflect the combin of suppli and demand   and if demand is weak enough  an interest rate target could be hold up interest rate rather than push rate down   in my view  one indic worth look at in this regard is the pattern of money growth   i understand all the caveat that are necessari   when i look at money growth trend  there has been a clear taper off in the last few month   money growth over the last six month  as measur by both m  and mzm  has been in the neighborhood of   to    percent   i would feel much more confid that polici is truli expansionari if those number were more in the    to    percent rang   but they certain have been taper off in recent week   that   s all   thank you
i want to updat a littl stori that i told you a meet or two ago  i   ve been wonder sinc jerri jordan spoke if this had ani relev to his comment   i had mention that sever maquiladora along the tex mex border on the mexican side had left to go to china to take advantag of lower wage there than in mexico   our staff has identifi at least eight that made that move who have sinc return becaus they didn   t find the qualiti of labor in china up to standard   in one of those instanc  the chines govern kept the equip and machineri  took it apart to see how it work  and couldn   t get it back togeth   laughter   that might curb the outflow in the futur  in the eleventh district economi there   s not much pumpkin    laughter   at our meet in late septemb i report that growth in the eleventh district had stall over the previous two month   as indic in the latest beig book and by recent econom data  the texa economi has shown sign of contract over the last six week   our region economi had exhibit tentat sign of improv earlier in the year  but the inform from the second and third quarter suggest that we   re still in recess   employ has declin for five consecut month  and the unemploy rate has been stuck at     percent for the last three month   the econom mood express at our board of director meet over the last two month has been somber at best   beig book contact indic that all sector of our economi are move backward with the except of agricultur   more disturb is the fact that our contact were virtual uniform in their descript of current condit and the outlook for the remaind of the year   usual we get a mix pictur  with some compani and industri move forward while other are regress  but not this  e  the eleventh district has been weaker than the nation part becaus of our concentr in high tech manufactur industri and in energi  both of which have continu   to contract in recent month   construct is more of a mix pictur   and like the rest of the countri  residenti activ is hold up pretti well but commerci vacanc rate are rise sharpli  turn to the nation  sinc our septemb meet the nation economi has also weaken somewhat   again  use the beig book as the sourc  three district report firmer econom condit   most of the remain district character econom activ as remain soft or as have deterior   my own view of the nation economi is captur in new york   s summari      the economi show further sign of slow while price of good and servic were report to be flat to down slight      the statist reinforc this pictur of an economi on the rope   declin in retail sale and in capit good order and shipment stand out   but declin in industri product and in the lead econom indic  along with a deep plung in consum confid  are also worrisom   last week   s job report   the establish survey is the one that we should be look at   suggest that we   ve had negat job growth so far dure this past year of what presum is a recoveri  my economist tell me that in forecast inflat a naiv forecast   about as well on averag as more sophist techniqu   that be the case  i   ll assum that inflat over the next six month will be close to what it has been over the last six month   and there seem to be no recent develop in the economi that would suggest that inflat is like to acceler  if anyth  a slow economi togeth with the way that product has been hold up suggest slight lower inflationari pressur in the month ahead  at our last meet i suggest that we need to eas by    basi point   the evid that has becom avail sinc then reinforc that feel   some peopl  includ some at our   bank  are more concern than i am that a negat demand shock could caus the disinfl trend we   ve had late to morph into deflat  the fomc has avoid inflat target be thrust upon it by polit mandat   in essenc the congress has given us the discret to set our own inflat target larg becaus they   ve trust us to do the right thing   if we were to allow a situat to develop in which the u s  economi experienc deflat  the congress would be like to impos inflat target on  us and they like would be somewhat differ from those we might impos on ourselv   we can debat what we believ to be the current rate of inflat  but i think we would all agre that we   re at or near the lower end of the rang that we would set if we did have inflat target  our job right now seem to be to make sure that we don   t go below that floor  in summari  i think we should eas signific  primarili to s ul econom growth and employ growth   the low and fall inflat rate  with some possibl of deflat  make the risk of that eas veri small
mr  chairman  the tenth district economi has shown sign of slow sinc the last meet   but most of our busi contact still remain relat op ist about the futur   job growth has been slow  and layoff announc have pick up  after subsid through late summer   reflect the weak labor market and the general climat of uncertainti  consum are spend less freeli than they were earlier   also new commerci construct has halt  as has the recoveri in manufactur in our region   on a brighter note  hous activ continu to hold up despit increas concern that the boost to demand from low mortgag rate is near it end   there   s no real sign of that yet    let me speak just a littl more about manufactur   it has been flat  as i said  for four consecut month follow a strong rebound earlier in the year   in the bank   s octob manufactur survey  product and new order move slight abov year ago level but that  of cours  reflect the depress level last year stem from the effect of septemb     still  firm are moder op ist about activ six month from now  and they continu to project improv  the district   s labor market   remain slack  and job growth slow in most state dure the third quarter   and layoff announc increas somewhat notic in octob after declin a bit in both august and septemb  let me talk a minut about consum spend  which has eas somewhat   retail sale have edg down from earlier in the summer  as uncertainti and slow job growth have taken their toll   auto sale also have slow sinc august  as some of the manufactur have back away from zero percent financ onli to reinstat it subsequ   i think the way one of our major auto dealer describ the interest rate environ for the auto industri is veri interest   he view the environ befor septemb     as we eas rate  as compar to how he might imagin smoke marijuana  wherea now it seem as if those in the industri are mainlin the drug   his point is that they can   t get away from the zero rate financ and are even expand on it   i think that   s import to take note of  look at wage and price pressur  they remain larg subdu in the region   in an inform survey we conduct just a week ago  firm said that wage like will increas about the same in      as in        and as other have note  health insur cost will go up much more  it is one of the area that employ are concern about    briefli  the farm economi continu to be rather mix   the weather condit have chang again  with rain delay some harvest   but i want to mention that the drought condit and the plung in livestock cash receipt are expect to drive farm incom down signific in our region as we look to       turn to the nation economi  obvious recent data show the news to be mix  as other have point out   growth in this quarter is like to be low  though i would suspect not quit as low as in the  book forecast   but i wouldn   t quibbl over the differ   look to the futur  like the  book i expect growth to pick up  return to trend level in the second half of next year and to abov trend level in        i think it   s import to recogn that this outlook obvious reflect the s ul effect of fiscal and monetari polici current in place   but i realiz that we are face some import and strong countervail forc  vacanc rate  capit overhang  and excess capac in the high tech industri have damp invest spend as we   ve note   this is a situat that monetari polici probabl will not be abl to quick or easili offset   perhap more import are the forc of uncertainti   there is the risk of a war with iraq  it  e  durat  and so forth are an uncertainti   terror is an uncertainti   and the uncertainti of just how the economi is perform in this kind of  environ has it own effect   this lead me to understand whi there is discuss of further interest rate cut   but  not unlik al broaddus  i would sound a cautionari note   i think further cut will in fact s ul consum and busi spend  as dave   said  but perhap more margin than the normal statist model would suggest becaus of the issu of  uncertainti   it   s import also to realiz that the posit effect on consum spend will come primarili as a result of consum take on ad debt   mayb it won   t be substanti in term   of the imbal that we talk about   but i believ it is import in the sens of increas their fragil for the futur   so i think part of our discuss on polici should address the issu of long term against short term tradeoff  given the high degre of uncertainti and relat to that the uncertainti of how our polici might affect outcom go forward   thank you

econom activ in our southeast region slow further in earli fall  despit the cutesi sign we   ve all seen in some merchant    window such as    we hear we   re in a  period of slow growth but we   ve decid not to particip      or some version of that   our area is not show it typic  fa  bounceback from recess than other area of the countri  that   s larg explain by the absenc of the usual sharp hous rebound that has often jump start our extens hous relat industri and the continu sluggish in busi servic  a sector on which we   ve develop a substanti depend   tourism and busi travel are still

holiday season are modest  in part becaus of the short period between thanksgiv and christma   but our   retail are not expect a total disast either   becaus of their lower sale expect  they tell us they   re be conserv in their approach to both inventori and staf   auto sale in septemb fell below year ago level   region manufactur remain sluggish except for defens and auto relat compani   year to date through septemb our defens contractor have garner      billion in new contract  and that has been a nice shot in the arm for mani compani   consist with recent aggreg evid on improv product

offic leas agent told me ye day  it   s not so much becaus of the overbuild of new space that he has seen in other cycl but the collaps of demand   his compani has reduc staff  tighten their belt  and given space back   he suggest the work off of current excess offic space is go to take quit a long  e    a final comment on the region   the district   s credit market are character by solid consum

we see few sign of credit suppli problem  deposit and wholesal fund to bank are readili avail  and bank stand readi to lend to creditworthi compani   credit qualiti still appear to be good  and bank tell us that they think they   re past the low point in the current credit qualiti cycl  on the nation front  the hope that data releas between fomc meet might provid some veri clear hint about the futur direct of the economi seem to have been  as roger   remind us at the last meet  wish think   the measur rebound in output growth in the third quarter and the slow second quarter were general in line with expect  and subsequ data seem to be general consist with a slow fourth quarter as most have been forecast   i do not think we should be surpris or should despair at the lack of an employ rebound at this point in the cycl   as the  book suggest  it is quit like that we will have some more month of modest employ gain  with limit growth in final demand  continu of good product gain  and the general sens of caution that hang over corpor america becaus of geopolit issu   we should take some comfort in the fact that labor market seem to have stabil at least to some extent in recent month  i would argu that the continu delay in the rebound in invest spend  while disappoint  is understand  given the substanti excess capac that has built up in mani industri and the  e it alway take for new invest such as we had in the late     s to becom fulli oper in the payback mode   and there   s a general sens of caution and  uncertainti as well as the geopolit issu that hang over decisionmak   consum incom   continu to grow  and consum have begun to restructur their balanc sheet to slow down debt accumul and to shift debt composit toward mortgag   consum have also moder their spend even in the context of veri low interest rate and extraordinari incent on auto financ   go forward  consum spend appear like to be more subdu   but that  at least in my mind  is understand and ration  in short  i believ that we are posit to experi the modest but fundament sound growth trace out in the  book   i for one would be reason happi with such an outcom   iron  by almost ani yardstick except that of the late     s we   d be pleas with such a path   as we move to the polici discuss  i think it will be tempt to want to do someth even when the balanc between potenti short term gain and the potenti longer term negat of a still more accommod polici are not complet clear  at least not to me  i have been among those who have urg that patienc be part of our prescript and that we weigh care the pressur to pump up short term spend and growth in sector that may alreadi be at or beyond sustain level   the expect slower growth in the fourth quarter  which is a short two month from be histori  and the forecast for next year and beyond don   t look all that bad to me   as perhap anoth voic in the wilder  i think a case can still be made for some patienc   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in our discuss and announc we have been count on polici accommod and elev product growth to boost the rate of econom expans and over  e to begin to close the output gap   the logic is impecc  but it   s not happen   recent data confirm the sour anecdot about flag demand  product  and employ that we   ve heard from the summer on and that have been so evid in report   from reserv bank and other sourc   smooth through the month data with their distort from chang auto incent and shift season  and take the staff forecast for the fourth quarter at it face valu  it   s evid that econom expans has slow from the first to the second half of the year   import  this has reflect a downshift in the growth of privat domest final demand rather than the speed up we expect   the weak in invest persist  and now consumpt growth is taper off   moreov  the weak is global  growth is slow in mani place and  as   remark  it reflect shortfal in domest demand abroad  not just a reaction to slower u s  growth  it   s not entir clear whi the strong fundament are not show through   it   seem  like that the geopolit risk we have cite   concern about terror  war  and oil price    have made peopl more cautious  especi busi in their invest decis   more basic  the backwash of the previous capit spend boom has proven stronger and more persist than anticip   this is evid not onli in linger capit overhang in a few sector but also in continu suspicion that corpor still have more residu bad news to reveal and consider uncertainti about how an unusu busi cycl led by capit spend will work itself out  among other atyp develop  busi failur  default  and downgrad have continu to mount even after three quarter with averag growth of   percent   and despit the effort of busi to trim cost  which have been reflect in astonish product  number  the rebound in profit has been limit  in effect stall out in recent quarter  disappoint with growth and profit and the percept of heighten risk and uncertainti have had a mark effect on financi market   and reaction in those market are reinforc   the caution in busi and household spend  in part by offset the effect of polici eas on financi condit  like presid pool  i was think about the degre of monetari accommod we have   although the committe has reduc the feder fund rate by     basi point sinc septemb           and the ten year treasuri rate has come down    basi point  the bbb corpor rate   a good proxi for the long term borrow cost face the median corpor    has actual risen    basi point over this period   stock price are off    percent  and the broad exchang rate index is about unchang   in addit  with the credit status of busi chang rapid  market are quick to price in possibl problem   in other word  in sever key dimens  financi condit are tighter and market less recept than they were befor the current degre of polici accommod was put in place   against this econom and financi background perhap we shouldn   t be surpris that polici accommod is be felt primarili in the hous market  where rate have follow treasuri yield  and that busi are conserv resourc by hold back on capit spend and hire  look forward  i think the contour of the staff forecast   a gradual lift of gloom and restraint and a strengthen of demand   are as good a guess as ani  given the uncertainti that dave emphas   a high proport of the credit and transpar problem accumul dure the boom period should alreadi have emerg  suggest that default and downgrad should level off and begin to declin along with earn restat  thus help to reduc risk premium in market   and this should contribut to a pickup in equiti price  further lower the negat tug from the wealth effect   the jump in equiti price  the rise in long term yield  and the declin in some risk premium over the intermeet period suggest that financi market alreadi see light at the end of the tunnel   but on mani occas in recent memori such   a light turn out to be an oncom train   continu strength in hous attest to household    under willing to spend   at some point  some of the geopolit uncertainti should begin to dissip  and we do need to recal the natur resili of the economi   it tendenc to return to high level of product when there are no impedi   this resili produc surpris strong result onli a few quarter ago  but the pickup envis is gradual and project   the data are go the other way  as a consequ  the economi look as if it will be on a lower track  oper with a higher and possibl rise level of slack and greater disinflationari   or even possibl deflationari    pressur than we expect  while inflat is alreadi as low as i would like to see it go   and the automat stabil properti of the financi market have been short circuit by heighten percept of and avers to risk   so if i can edg just a bit into the second half of the meet   after all i   ve been good for two meet and that   s about as much as one can expect   i do think it   s  e for a littl extra push from this committe to enhanc the odd of a vigor rebound from the weaker level of activ now in process   thank you  mr  chairman

the second district economi has shown some sign of weaken sinc the last report  but labor market condit and price have remain fair stabl   retail report that sale weaken in octob despit a slight weather relat pickup in the second half of the month   inventori are down from a year ago  but they   re  describ as a bit high  and retail say they are discount more heavili   consum confid in the region fell sharpli in octob  reach a new cyclic low   unemploy rate in the district were steadi to low in septemb  and payrol employ was about   unchang   home construct was fair strong in septemb  but sale of exist home weaken  particular in the new york citi area   offic vacanc rate across most of new york citi continu to climb  but we   ve had some luck in fill offic space in lower manhattan   survey of district manufactur and purchas manag indic some improv in recent week   and banker in the district report steadi to rise loan demand  further tighten in busi lend standard  and veri stabl delinqu rate  the fiscal plight in new york citi is veri difficult to exagger   the size of the deficit is approxim equal to that in the mid     s at about    billion to    billion   it look as if a combin of increas tax and reduc expenditur may solv about    billion of the shortfal   some smoke and mirror will take care of about anoth billion dollar  but that leav    billion to    billion that will have to be borrow in a veri inhospit market   the state is in no posit to help the citi in ani substanti way  and i think we are go to hear about the magic of revenu share be express veri loud by the congression deleg from new york in come month
they don   t want to share revenu    laughter
no  the revenu come from here to there
that   s a littl clearer
it   s call revenu share   it   s a euphem   at the nation level  we at the new york reserv bank think that the econom outlook remain uncertain  to put it mild  with veri consider near term downsid risk   our forecast has growth of less than   percent in the fourth quarter  and we believ that a reason forecast for next year call for fair decent growth like that of the  book   but we as a bank believ and i person believ veri strong that the  e to take out some insur against the downsid   risk has arriv   in my view  one can reach that opinion easili just by look at the domest economi alon  but i think the intern situat make the need for insur even clearer  europ is stagnat   there was an agreement announc this morn between franc and germani that they would combin posit go into each meet of the econom and financi council of the european communiti  which mean that a larg center right major in franc is go to be guid by a veri small center left major in germani   how that would make sens to french voter baffl me somewhat  but that   s what they decid   i mention at the last meet that japan is japan   well  it   s still japan but even more so after the recent  adventur with bank restructur or not bank restructur   and latin america  despit some respit for brazil  is if anyth weaker   it   s my belief that the  e for the committe to act has arriv   and in my view the action that we take today should be decis   thank you  mr  chairman
i agre with mani of the comment and remark that have alreadi been made  the expans appear to be lose momentum and slow  but it is still move ahead   dure the last coupl of month  manufactur activ  new order  auto sale  and general retail sale have slow from their prior pace   and capit spend still show no upward momentum  as compani continu to cut cost to achiev earn growth  especi in an atmospher of increas uncertainti about geopolit and econom risk  on the plus side  hous continu at strong level   as governor kohn just mention  while the cost of capit to compani has been rise  it continu to set record low for the household sector   and i think that   s the reason we   re see growth there   busi inventori final show sign of growth after six quarter of liquid  and that   s a plus   busi fix   invest  as we   ve discuss alreadi  is show mix signal depend on which set of number one look at   i would say  base on talk to corpor execut  that the disconnect is part becaus execut think of expens run through the p l statement   with the huge wave of capit spend in      and       which now is fulli amort off the book  firm actual can increas outlay and still have declin expens  overal the tone of recent econom activ has been veri disappoint   there is littl indic of strength in major economi elsewher in the world  and it   s not evid that our economi can get much of a boost from ani outsid sourc   now  i know that monetari polici oper with long lag  but it has been eleven month sinc our last chang in the fed fund target rate   when i look at the staff forecast this  e  i notic that in this quarter and the first half of      the output gap has been widen by   point   that tell me not onli that we have to wait longer for a rebound but that the gap between actual and potenti econom growth is bigger   at the last meet i thought it was a veri close call as to whether we had reach the point where we need to eas further   the data that we   ve receiv sinc that meet tell me that the  e is now right and we must move at this meet
thank you  mr  chairman   a number of peopl have alreadi discuss the weak of the incom data  the step down in growth from h  to h  and the fact that forecast have mark down the near term and intermedi term outlook   so i   ll not attempt to elabor on those point   rather  i   d like to focus my few minut on two  assumpt that i think are import in the baselin  book scenario and that give me some concern    first  the baselin assum that over the forecast period invest will pick up   of cours we recogn  as dave   said in respons to cathi     s question  that a number of busi clear are invest in some element of busi fix invest  real invest in equip and softwar is inde posit   howev  there are sever reason for my question whether the level of invest will increas in the intermedi term   one is that we realli don   t know the degre of capit good overhang and cannot take for grant the statement that the  book author make earli on that the capit stock is realli closer to firm    desir level   as the staff well recal  a few year ago we attempt to find answer to this question and  while i believ the work was well done  the conclus i would say was not definit  anoth reason for doubt an intermedi turnaround in invest  at least with respect to the manufactur sector  is obvious that capac util is relat low  and the relationship between invest and capac are quit clear  the third reason for have some doubt about the forecast of a bounceback in invest as built into the  book baselin is that we know that busi fix invest  particular in equip and softwar  is driven by two separ forc   one a substitut effect and one an incom effect   the substitut effect  base on the fact that the price of capit has come down relat to labor  would lead busi natur to want to substitut capit for labor   from that explan  one would expect to find a negat correl between employ growth and invest growth   there   s also an incom effect  which i think we   ve been talk about implicit here  uncertainti with respect to the outlook may inde hold back busi in term of make new invest    i ask the staff to perform a simpl test of these correl to see if the negat or the posit   that is to say the substitut effect or the incom effect   was stronger   it turn out that for long period of  e  includ the post      period  the posit correl between increas in employ and increas in invest was veri strong  and inde statist signific   the reason i rais this technic point relat to the implicit assumpt in mani comment that it is in fact the outlook with respect to profit  growth  et cetera  that is import in busi peopl   s think   inde  that turn out statist to be the case   and sinc the outlook here is realli quit murki  it is not surpris that it has taken some  e for invest to pick up  the fourth reason i have some concern about invest as built into the baselin forecast has alreadi been note  and that is that for mani corpor the cost of capit has not becom lower dure the intermeet period   inde  it has becom higher   in addit to that  we see from the survey of senior loan offic that demand for loan  from bank at least  has been tepid   and that has been attribut in larg part to reduc capit expenditur and lower plan expenditur   so we should have at least some concern about the baselin on the invest side  i   m equal as skeptic with respect to the consumpt side for a number of reason  one is that the incom tax reduct from the      tax legisl have for the most part alreadi play out   they are forecast to add i think onli     percent to gdp growth for      and       second  mortgag refinanc  while still high  do show a tendenc to be invers relat to  chang in mortgag rate and not just to the level of rate   so if mortgag rate do not continu to come down  then there might not be the support for a continu wave of refinanc at the recent high level   and final  as other have indic  while there may be reason to interpret   the most recent round of auto incent differ  the respons to those incent has not been as encourag as earlier round   one might add to that wane consum confid  so i put all this togeth to say that in my person forecast  though i   m not a profession forecast  i would put more weight on the altern scenario involv weaker aggreg demand as oppos to the baselin   and that scenario take the baselin and make it  to my mind  look much wors   now  unlik governor kohn  i seek no indulg   i will not go into the discuss reserv for the second half of our meet   i will onli encourag the committe to look to anoth altern in the  book  which is the lower fund rate forecast   laughter   i think that   s consist with the rule
so to speak   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i won   t belabor the evid of present day weak  but let me look ahead and ask what i think is an import question   it is  what is go to drive the economi   in the late     s it was invest  more recent it has been consumpt and hous   what   s next   i can   t find much   consumpt has held up well until now  but evid of collaps lie all around us   auto sale were high through august but drop sharpli in septemb and octob   non auto consumpt spend was strong through juli but has bare grown sinc then   consum confid has drop sharpli as has the wealth incom ratio  kick into consumpt function right about now   person save rate are begin their long anticip rise   hous  too  has held up well until now  but the staff  has forecast it to drop off next year larg becaus of stock adjust consider  fiscal polici could provid an expansionari boost  and inde one   hear that fiscal polici is accommod   but what one realli should hear is that fiscal polici use to be accommod  it   s not particular so now   the staff comput a measur of the fiscal impetus   of the feder budget  cyclic adjust  with each budget compon weight by it like impact on spend   this measur rose to a peak with the spend increas and tax cut in the first half of the year but now has drop back about three quarter of the way toward neutral  where it stay rough through the end of the forecast period   fiscal polici is not restrict  but it   s not near as expansionari as it was  and everybodi know that at the state and local level budget polici will have to be quit restrict this year  conceiv export could provid a boost to the expans  but this  sn   t appear veri like either   the staff is now project that foreign output growth will be less over the forecast period   they have an export incom elast of    so export should be at best a neutral factor  perhap the impetus to demand can come from busi fix invest  it may eventu  but it   s not like to happen soon   real busi fix invest has or is slate to drop in everi quarter of      befor begin to grow again next year   in term of the forecast for next year  it is sober to go back and check the  book forecast on busi fix invest  they   ve been steadili lower by fair larg amount sinc last march  none of this chang the fundament econom of the pictur   when the capit overhang develop  capit invest spend was expect to be weak for a while  and the length and depth of the slowdown would depend on how well other type of spend fill the gap   hous has fill the gap admir up to now   consumpt fill it until late summer  fiscal polici help for a while   but until invest come back  there seem to be noth to drive the economi at this point   henc  it seem quit reason to forecast  as the staff    a continu of output gap  slowli rise unemploy  and slowli fall inflat   whether the continu high level of unemploy or the possibl earli onset of deflat are more worrisom  i leav to the listen to decid    much of that commentari would have been consid radic a short  e ago but it is now fair standard   the new question is whether at these low interest rate further monetari expans will help lift the economi out of the doldrum   there are invers between short and long rate  and mayb we have a situat where short rate can be cut without much impact on long rate or on the economi   i think not  for sever reason  invers can come about from various type of market imperfect or chang in expect   but the usual reason is inflat   in this scenario  common attribut to milton friedman but perhap more appropri to henri thornton   i got that from bill pool     laughter  lower short rate impli an increas in money growth and higher perman inflat  the key link is to higher perman rate of inflat   but it is simpli hard for me to see how a modest monetari expans at this point could generat much inflat   moreov  even if cut in short rate just lower long rate a bit   as they may  given the present low level of long rate   that bit may be quit import   long live asset such as common stock or invest good are valu by divid the stream of earn by the long rate   and at low level small chang can have big effect on valuat   becaus of this year   s stock market declin  forward earn price ratio are now back to level well abov the long term real interest rate  and some rise in stock valu  perhap as a result of monetari expans  should not be unexpect   but we could also see reduc default rate  drop in credit spread affect lowli rate borrow  and further declin in mortgag rate   even the mighti dollar could final fall if our short and long rate drop   reflect a point that don kohn first made and that roger   talk about a minut ago  economist at goldman sach point out that  becaus of the dollar and the stock market  their index of overal financi condit indic that monetari condit actual are tighter now than when we first start eas back in earli        one   may not buy this claim entir  but it still seem like that at the margin further rate cut should be expansionari  obvious  we   re make polici under uncertainti here   the economi is buffet by  new and not well understood factor  and interest rate are well out of their histor rang   we cannot be certain that the economi is too weak  though i feel pretti strong that it is   we cannot be certain that further money eas would help  though i feel pretti strong that it would  thank you
let me make two general point   first  in convers with banker i survey over the past week  almost everyth i pick up anecdot support the updat that dave   gave us   second  i would say that the flavor of those anecdot was along the line that cathi    among other  describ veri well   but i   d like to go over just a coupl point that i did pick up  one of the banker that i talk to has an automobil financ subsidiari in nine state on the east coast  and in all nine state  sale of new vehicl are down across the board   he attribut that to the fact that the spate of aggress financ deal has in fact exhaust the appetit for new car purchas   so in the view of my banker contact  the strength that we   ve been abl to get from the automobil side probabl has been dissip   moreov  and this is a secondari consider from their standpoint  they don   t believ that the automobil manufactur can sustain the strateg direct they have taken  with essenti profitless sale of automobil   becaus of the deterior in their financi posit  they   ve increas the risk premium   they   re go to have to find a new paradigm there  so that approach is probabl over    on residenti real estat  howev  i got the same sens that susan bie and other have talk about   there is still strength in that sector  with no deterior evid   from the bank side what we   re get is no improv in commerci lend activ and no signific deterior in asset qualiti   but in addit to their assess of develop in the auto and residenti real estat sector  all three of the banker that i talk to had the same sens that activ in the retail sector has declin  move to the fiscal polici issu  ye day   s elect has enorm implic   most of the focus up to this point has been on the construct of the new congress start in januari   but some signific issu will be address in the interim dure the lame duck session   some of the variabl are so recent and so unexpect that they haven   t realli been consid fulli  but let me go over a coupl of them  first of all  the govern is be fund now on a continu resolut that goe onli through novemb      so either the congress has to address that by a continu resolut that would go beyond the  e the next congress conven  probabl until about march  or the matter will have to be taken up this year  second  the most critic elect that took place ye day in term of the near term was in missouri   with senat talent be elect to fill an unexpir term  he will be elig to take that seat as soon as the elect is certifi   and in minnesota with the death of paul wellston and the appoint of an independ to serv briefli  if you assum that the independ will caucus independ as oppos to senat  er who caucus as a democrat  the number will be fifti republican  forti nine democrat  and one independ  the immedi implic is that becaus no vote is requir for senat major leader  senat lott will simpli be acknowledg as the new major leader   on the other hand  in order to   chang committe chair  there must be a vote   so there   s at least some possibl that a week from now when the senat reconven we   ll have a republican senat major leader and democrat as committe chair  now  what   all that mean    laughter   i think one of the thing it mean is that there   s incent on both side to address the appropri bill   in my view the democrat will  believ that they can   t get a better deal next year than they can obtain this year   and my sens is that in the fiscal polici area the republican want to address tax polici and want to address it veri quick   my guess is that they do not want to do that in a context where they   re look also at appropri bill   so there will be incent on both side to get that done this year  therefor  i think there   s a real possibl that we may see one singl  veri larg appropri bill in this interim session
may i just ask a quick technic question  what is the  incent  given the vote ye day  for the presid to sign such a bill
i think it   s so the republican will then be abl to move on and focus on tax polici   that is  if he is reason satisfi with the dollar amount in the bill   that would be my guess  that there will be some incent to get past it for the purpos of move on with their agenda   when we talk about revenu share it remind me that  when the concept of revenu share becam law  that was also a  e when the congress had incent   becaus of the acceler tax rate  there was incent to build in inflat  and it was a tax polici that we call    progress    at the  e   fortun  we   ve move away from that era  in summari  the consum side  which had been the sourc of strength in this economi  clear has deterior sinc our septemb meet  and base on anecdot report from the banker i talk with  it look as if there is no pickup yet on the busi side   assum that   there is a fiscal polici agenda in the form of tax cut polici  it undoubt will not take effect at all in the year        so i think the situat clear has deterior from what we were see at the  e of our last fomc meet
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to focus on a simpl arithmet implic of the unusu product growth that we   ve been observ  which is that it creat a wedg between the rate of output growth and the rate of input growth   as a result  we have a situat current in which the recoveri  measur in term of output growth and spend growth  seem if not robust at least accept   but if we look at the economi from the input growth side or the factor util side  we see a veri  veri weak economi   indic of labor util  for exampl  includ payrol employ  the workweek  and product worker hour  have been basic flat for the year   inde  i had a comparison done between these seri for the current period and the         jobless recoveri  and they seem to be ident  capit is likewis not be use to it capac   capac util has not onli been flat for the past year  but it absolut level is at near record low in the aggreg as well as in mani individu industri   in short  the evid from the input side of the economi suggest that the gap between output and potenti output is  if anyth  widen rather than diminish   continu slow in core inflat  both at the produc and consum level    which i talk about at the last meet   is consist with the presumpt of a signific output gap in the current economi  i think there   s agreement around the tabl that in the languag of macro textbook the economi is face a seri of is shock   various factor that have inhibit the desir of firm to invest and consum to buy   the right respons to that normal is to s ul and lower   interest rate still further   the fomc has been quit patient   we   ve kept the fund rate unchang now for almost a year   so i think it is  e to consid take some action   a signific rate cut at this point would not be a panacea obvious  but i do think it would help  also  i   d like to take issu a bit with the view that there   s a general capit overhang  one would think that the stori would be that certain industri   like the telecom industri  for exampl   have so much capit relat to their long term need that there is essenti no interest rate at which they   d be will to invest   if you thought that was the case and if you look at factori util or capac util across industri  you would expect to see most industri close to normal  but with a few sector at extrem low util level  suggest that they have tremend overhang of capit   in fact  what we have is a relat normal distribut of capac util across industri   that is  slack is general rather than concentr in onli a few sector   given the avail of complementari resourc  labor in particular  i   m not sure that there can be such a thing as a general capit overhang  in ani case  i   m more op ist than governor   that interest rate reduct might increas invest spend   anoth posit factor i think worth mention is these veri weak inventori  which suggest that if spend   increas it will be translat more direct into product rather than into inventori reduct   and final  in contrast to       there do not appear to be signific financi headwind in this case  although governor kohn and   mention a few issu  to imped the effect of a rate cut at this junctur  so in short  i don   t know about pumpkin   laughter  but while the economi hasn   t fallen down the stair  i think it could use a push to make it up the next few step   thank you
i love this econometr languag   mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the materi that were distribut to you dure the coffe break   as has been true at the past few committe meet and as shown in the top right hand panel of your first exhibit  market particip expect the feder fund rate to turn a bit lower befor move up in the summer of next year  the nadir of the expect path of the feder fund rate is now a touch lower than in august and septemb  the left hand and middl panel   although the fund rate ul  rise to a level that is about the same as was anticip six week ago   the current situat is unlik that in advanc of those previous meet in anoth respect  as seen in the middl panel  by the evolut of an es  of the probabl of a   percentag point move as deriv from the front month money market futur contract   at last night   s close  financi market price were consist with a high probabl of action today   inde  as seen in the first two column of the tabl at the bottom of the exhibit in the summari of the money market servic survey of polici expect releas on friday  twenti five of the thirti six respond expect polici eas  with fifteen anticip a cut of    basi point and ten look for a    basi point move  appar regardless of the rate action  market particip expect you to retain an assess of risk balanc toward econom weak   move further ahead  the major of respond expect the fund rate to be at least as low as    percent in late januari  with the balanc of risk still point toward econom weak   thus  the case for hold the fund rate at    percent today must recogn that  as presid broaddus note  some market disappoint would attend the announc of that decis   but you might be will to accept that reaction   as shown in your next exhibit  your aggress polici action in      move the real feder fund rate  the dark line in the upper panel  from around    percent at the begin of the year  to about zero by year end  where it has been held sinc   although es  of the equilibrium real feder fund rate  repres by the swath of blue in the figur  have also move down  you   ve kept the real rate below the lower bound of that rang   the red line amid the blue plot one particular es   the frb us model   s view of the real short rate ul  consist with send aggreg demand to the level of potenti output   the spread of the actual real rate below this es  equilibrium concept has been sizabl for some  e  inde  the bottom panel cumul the effect of that wedg on the quarter growth of real gdp  at an annual rate   take into account the model   s assess of the lag in monetari polici   accord to those es   monetari polici s ulus began to kick in onli by the middl of last year  as polici eas was initi onli offset the cumul effect of the real rate run abov it equilibrium valu for much of the second half of the     s   the staff model would suggest that polici eas thus far has been ad about    percentag point to real gdp growth this year   given the lag in polici  the committe   s prior action will continu to impart sizabl  albeit wane  impetus over the forecast period      the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix        you may not be troubl by the assess that the s ulus to growth of your previous action will erod if you also believ that the forc current restrain spend  includ the lag effect of earlier declin in equiti wealth  credit stringenc both in market and at bank  and the enerv effect of elev uncertainti on household and busi confid  will be lift relat quick  in those circumst  the current degre of polici accommod would facilit a return of the growth of aggreg demand to that of potenti output in short order  but that is not the staff forecast  in which event turn a bit gloomier befor that rebound in growth materi   a mechan way of respond to that near term soft patch is offer in the bluebook in the policymak perfect foresight simul  repeat as your next exhibit   in this exercis  the frb us model with the extend  book assumpt is taken to be a complet  uner descript of the u s  economi   as shown in the two upper panel  these simul entail eas aggress over the next half year   and then tighten almost as quick   to work down the resourc slack evid in the unemploy rate plot in the middl panel   by these calcul  polici eas would be call for even if your implicit inflat target was   percent  the red line   let alon the     percent goal depict by the   line  inde  in this framework  polici eas is necessari to prevent inflat from edg below   percent  which might otherwis make the convent es  of the mean  bias in the pce inflat rate of   percent loom particular larg   given the concern express at recent meet of the potenti problem pose  should futur advers shock necessit put the real feder fund rate deepli into negat territori  the committe might have a prefer for more of an inflat cushion than that   if you were inclin to do so  the extent to which you might eas probabl interact with how you would assess the balanc of risk at that new stanc of polici  the subject of your final exhibit   at the top of the exhibit  i   ve list how the committe describ it disclosur polici when it was introduc in januari       as note in the first bullet  the committe has promis that it statement will express it    sens of risk to the attain of it long run goal of stabl price and sustain econom growth      howev  as in the second bullet  that attain is assess over the    forese futur     admit an elast concept about a    relev    period that may depend on econom condit   a complic that sever member have note at the past few meet is that the balanc of risk assess has the potenti to influenc investor    confid in the econom outlook as well as their expect of polici   if so  you might be concern that a polici action deem insuffici s ul to balanc the risk might be undercut by an advers reaction to the polici statement   this interact of  word and action make it difficult to build the case for eas    basi point in that  if you share the staff   s assess that econom momentum had flag  such a move would not like put the perceiv risk back into balanc   it would onli be if you view the outlook as have deterior a bit   but not as much as in the    book   that you might see    basi point of    insur    as fo  a better balanc to the risk   given the staff   s assess of the economi  you might see a    basi point move as a closer call on balanc the risk   by way of exampl  the lower left panel give the frb us model   s predict of what would happen to real gdp growth  the unemploy rate  and core pce inflat were you to lower the fund rate    basi point at this meet and hold it at that level thereaft   this is the    lower fund rate    altern of the  book  where the blue bar give the altern result and the red line depict the baselin outcom   as indic in the box at the right  even after    point of eas  the committe might indic that the risk were still tilt toward weak becaus in the near term   that is  befor ani effect of action today would plausibl leav an imprint on the economi   resourc slack build   moreov  the uncertainti surround the forecast might seem to weigh particular heavili on the downsid   howev  as note at the lower right  the committe might put particular weight on the observ that  after polici action  aggreg demand is expect to expand consider fa  than aggreg suppli in the second half of      and in       an outcom that might be seen to offset the prospect of declin core inflat if the    forese futur    stretch suffici far   it is also possibl that the committe might view action today as better balanc the odd of it own futur action  despit whether it saw the macroeconom consequ of an advers outcom for spend as wors than would attend a posit surpris   that is  eas today might make it a coin toss as to whether the next move was up or down   such an interpret of the risk assess  though  might not be seen as progress in your disclosur polici   three year ago  the committe abandon the old    tilt    in the direct becaus it had becom too rigid  interpret in market as a signal on the next polici action   that complet my prepar remark
i   m not necessarili in favor of this posit  but i guess i was a littl put off or confus by your dismiss of a    basi point move   isn   t it possibl  in light of the way the committe has use    basi point in the past  that the market would take that as an indic   particular with a downsid risk statement   that we   re go to move more than onc
as i state  there are two role for the balanc of risk statement   one is as an indic on the cours of the economi  and the other is an indic of the like prospect for polici over the forese futur   to the extent that market focus on the latter and see the risk tilt toward weak as rais the odd of action in decemb  then a cut of    basi point at this meet with an unbalanc risk statement is go to get them to price in signific odd of an addit    fair short
the macroeconom impact can   t be much differ
from a macro standpoint  if the fund rate is    basi point lower by decemb     it   s not go to make a whole lot of differ if it got there in one step or in two  but there is the first role for the balanc of risk statement that i mention as well  which a few member have emphas over the last coupl of meet  and that is  what will it do to busi and investor confid that the feder open market committe lower rate but still see the risk tilt toward econom weak   you have to balanc the two off
probabl noth differ than when we didn   t lower rate but said that the risk were uneven balanc toward the downsid
that   s what the polici discuss is go to be about
further question for     if not  let me get start on comment   to repeat some of the issu that i   ve rais with the committe in the past  the abil of this economi to withstand so mani shock  e after  e after  e has been extraordinarili impress   the necessari implic of that perform in my view is the emerg of a degre of flexibl in the economi that was not evid twenti or thirti year   ago   in turn  this increas flexibl strong suggest that the economi is in a veri favor posit to move forward  assum a posit under trend in product  what we have seen in the past sever week is that this flexibl is reflect in a high  degre of price elast of demand   in this regard  we would expect and inde we have observ in a period of repeat shock that sharp price declin have induc veri strong household demand  especi in the motor vehicl area and   indirect through declin mortgag rate   in the hous sector   in fact  the sens that deflationari forc are be offset by high price elast has been evid sinc the spring of        that   s one of the reason that i believ that the economi  despit have been shock repeat  is still stand even though  as i have indic previous  it is rather wobbl at the knee  it appear that gdp effect has been pretti close to flat over the last three month   in addit  the industri product index   insofar as we can judg from our week statist and the overal bls manhour figur   went down in octob  although it seem to come back a bit toward the end of the month   so what we have is an economi that can work it way through what in effect is describ in the  book as a    soft spot      howev  as governor olson  indic  the evid respons of motor vehicl sale to incent seem to have diminish recent and inde to have disappear  what that mean is that one of the pillar of spend that has kept the economi in a reason forward move mode has been remov   now  it is conceiv that the hesit in motor vehicl sale is temporari  and it may well be that  if the sale incent are increas enough  the weak will prove to be temporari   howev  the staff here has endeavor to adjust the sale figur for the chang in incent  and the adjust  sn   t do all that much for sale   what is clear the case is that motor vehicl sale slip below a    million   season adjust annual rate in the last ten day of octob   that slippag has remov  at least for the  e be  one of the element of forward momentum in the economi  which i would say is probabl essenti if we are to get through the current soft spot and in the end come out with the  book forecast  fortun  fair strong hous start and under hous construct are still provid import support to the economi   inde  the backlog report by the larg builder are move up at a relat rapid pace   we also have had fair strong sale of exist home  sale of both new and exist home have been materi assist by the persist declin in mortgag rate  which effect have follow down yield on aaa corpor and treasuri  the problem  unfortun  is that it   s not clear how much longer interest rate on ten year treasuri will fall   i mention that even though a good deal of the econometr   suggest that it is the level of the mortgag interest rate and not it declin as such that determin the rate of new and exist home sale   rememb  the sale of exist home engend a fair signific extract of equiti direct as a consequ of hous turnov   and clear cash out refinanc are also a function of the level of the current mortgag rate in relat to the averag rate on outstand residenti mortgag   what this suggest is that there is still consider momentum in the hous industri becaus mortgag rate remain low   moreov   there is unquestion still veri strong cash out avail as we go into decemb becaus applic have gone up veri dramat and there is usual a six week lag between mortgag applic and origin   of cours  it   s the  e of origin that creat the cash out moni  which as you may recal i said at the last meet were run at an annual rate of around      billion   and inde that explain a veri big part of the rise in mortgag debt dure the last coupl of year    there   s no question  howev  that we are run into downsid resist on mortgag rate  or  to make a slight softer statement  that the rate of declin in mortgag rate is slow  in ani event  it   s hard to escap the conclus that at some point our extraordinari hous boom and it carryov into veri larg extract of equiti  financ by veri larg increas in mortgag debt  cannot continu indefinit into the futur   and inde i presum that the rise in mortgag rate that has occur veri recent is basic a reflect of the strengthen in the stock market   one can argu that if that   s the case  we may be lose someth from the home equiti side but gain it elsewher   so that probabl is a wash  the import issu here is that we   re see some eros in the prop that support demand in the consum area  and someth els has to take it place   we   ve all been expect that capit invest will eventu acceler as consum spend deceler   that probabl will happen  but we are still look   it   s veri easi to get except moros about the outlook as the data come in  but there are posit sign  one relat to corpor profit  to be sure  they are difficult to evalu  i say that after have spoken to a lot of secur analyst and portfolio manag about the consequ of the veri dramat chang in account that have been occur in the last three or four month  inde sinc june   it isn   t the legisl that is do anyth to creat signific chang in account   it   s the market that all of a sudden is say that if a firm has a conserv account system  it will be reward with a premium in it price earn ratio  that is exact     degre from where we were a coupl of year ago  and it obvious is have a signific impact on earn es   this mean that even if the economi has chang not at all  the mere shift to conserv bookkeep would induc a signific declin in project s p earn  which inde it has   the onli question is whether under profit is   improv  and the answer to that is appar    yes      if we look at the nipa account and adjust for the fact that stock option are expens when they are exercis rather than when the actual opportun cost is incur  we get a weaker under profit figur than we ordinarili would expect  given our assess of what product is do and what everyth els is do  what is happen  as best i can judg  is that these two set of profit forecast are now final come togeth   in my view  there is quit a good chanc that we are underes  the outlook for profit in that an upturn is occur that could prove to be a littl stronger than we current expect   if that turn out to be the case  and i suspect that it will though i cannot say i know for sure  it mean that cash flow will be improv and that stronger capit invest will eventu materi provid the overhang of uncertainti  veri specif the uncertainti relat to geopolit risk  dissip   this is a gulf war scenario all over again  you may recal that when iraq invad kuwait in the summer of       oil price initi took off   but as the buildup to the fight with american forc took place  we experienc a progress more debilit degre of uncertainti   it took a veri signific toll on consum expenditur and inde was probabl an import  if not the primari  caus of the       recess   we now have the same problem to work through   it   s difficult to know when  or even if  there will be anoth middl east war   it   s veri hard to make judgment on this sort of thing  then  of cours  as mani of you have mention  the european and japanes economi are not be veri help  but that   s not a big surpris  in sum  it strike me that we are look at an economi that potenti has signific upsid momentum if it can get through the current soft spot   and if that   s the case  i suspect that the  book forecast will prove to be too low   becaus inventori are tight as a drum and   capit invest is go absolut nowher  there   s onli one direct they can go if we remov the current uncertainti   that   s a big    if      we can   t assum at this stage that those key sector will lift the overal economi in line with the  book forecast or even that they will produc a posit outcom   we are deal with what basic is a latent deflationari type of economi  and we are all acut awar of the implic of that kind of economi   presid broaddus sever meet ago apt express what i think is the consensus of this committe on the issu of a potenti deflationari hole   it is a pretti scari prospect  and one that we certain want to avoid  the question is what we should do at this point   i think it   s correct to say that  if we move signific today   and my suggest would be to lower the fund rate    basi point    it is possibl that such a move may be a mistak   but it   s a mistak that   not have veri signific consequ   on the other hand  if we fail to move and we are wrong  mean that we need to  the cost could be quit high   i am not awar of anyth that suggest we will not be abl to turn our polici stanc around if we reduc the fund rate and that turn out to have been wrong   we can turn it around fair quick  but i   m not even sure that    quick    will be all that necessari   what i   m say is that we can veri readili adjust to that kind of mistak   i don   t think we could adjust all that easili if we were to fail to move and the economi began to deterior and we were look into a deep deflationari hole  i don   t think    basi point is an adequ respons larg becaus it seem too tepid a move for the potenti deflationari situat we face  which is a go no go type of situat  we are either go to get it  or we are not   and if we are go to get it     basi point  sn   t seem to be the right respons   if we are not  we   re go to have to revers either the    or the     and i   m not sure that matter all that much    assum we decid to lower the fund rate by    basi point  the t i question in my view is whether we move to a balanc risk assess or retain the current tilt toward weak   we haven   t move the fund rate this year  and first move histor have tend to elicit a greater respons than we general expect   i   m worri that we can readili be seen as do too much in that we can inadvert creat a psycholog and concern that say    the feder reserv know someth that we don   t know      as   just discuss  the issu of our balanc of risk statement and it presum psycholog effect is a veri t i question becaus we   re suppos to be decid on our action independ of how the market is go to respond   yet we know we can   t do that   as a practic matter  we have to take action that includ our assess of the market   s respons to our statement regard the balanc of risk  and even though i think we can make argument that the risk to the economi  even after a    basi point move  may well remain tilt toward weak  i would be veri much disinclin to indic that in our statement   first of all  it may not be true becaus the risk after such a move may in fact be balanc in term of the outlook for the forese futur   nor do i think keep the present tilt toward weak would add anyth   we don   t need to enhanc our credibl at this point   in sum  the benefit of retain the current tilt toward weak in my judgment are veri small  and the risk of misinterpret are veri high   accord  i conclud that go to a balanc risk statement is appropri if we do    basi point   there are other possibl combin  which i endeavor to think through to a greater or lesser extent   i believ  after listen to the committe   s discuss  that lower the rate by    basi point and go to balanc risk seem to averag out close to the committe   s consensus   i hope i   m right  and so i rais the issu for discuss to find out   vice chair
thank you  mr  chairman   not surpris  i do think that you   re right  but let me explain whi   it seem to me that it   s veri clear from the discuss around the tabl that we need to take out insur against the downsid risk in the  book forecast and in everybodi els   s forecast that i heard   when one is take insur against downsid risk  one should take out the amount of insur that is appropri     basi point simpli is not enough   first of all  the immedi market reaction to    basi point slant toward weak would be that the committe is compos of a bunch of wimp  which is not an attract assess for a group that is suppos to be a veri import public bodi   but second  the market would immedi crank in an assumpt of anoth    basi point either in the intermeet period or at the decemb meet  which would be consider more destabil than do the right thing in one move today   whi would we say that we   d go with a statement of balanc risk   well  if take out insur against downsid risk is what we   re about  which i think it is  the whole purpos of that is to balanc the risk   if    basi point is the right number  it should balanc the risk   if it isn   t the right number  we should use a bigger number  which i don   t think is necessari   if we did    basi point with the balanc of risk toward weak  in the first place i think it would be wrong   in the second place  it would scare the hell out of everybodi   i can assur you  as your man in new york  that if there   s anyth of which i   m certain after mani year of be in market  that would scare them  that would be veri  veri unwis  now  i think a legi  question if we go with    basi point and a balanc risk statement is    it tie our hand   i don   t think so   it certain  sn   t tie our hand if in fact  we took out insur and didn   t need it   that would be good news   that would be great  and everybodi would cheer  start with us   so it certain  sn   t tie our hand in that direct    on the other hand  if at the next meet or the meet after that we decid that the situat was deterior further and we had to take out more insur or we want to make a more normal non insur move  our hand would not be tie either  so it seem to me that the recommend that you have given us is the right and prudent thing to do  and it in no way prohibit ani action that we may wish to take in the futur  thank you
thank you   i think the vice chairman   s descript of the virtu of    basi point and balanc risk versus    and the risk tilt toward weak is correct  and i won   t repeat that   but to me the issu is more one of a chang now versus no chang   and in the spirit of what gari  n said earlier about what one think one know with some confid  for me it is this   if i look at the sen ent survey  the risk premium in market  and the invers of the yield curv on the front end  and if i listen to the anecdot inform about uncertainti and fear   and give veri littl weight to the pickup of the stock market in octob  though i wouldn   t dismiss that entir   it seem clear that the natur rate has move down  when the natur rate move down with an unchang intervent rate  it mean that the de facto stanc of polici has at the minimum becom less expansionari and possibl restrict   i don   t know which is the case here   i may not go as far as bill pool might on what is the desir growth in nomin money measur  but i do believ that in this environ less s ulus or a deceler in monetari growth  if it were to occur  would be undesir   so i prefer go with a    basi point cut and a balanc risk statement
mr  chairman  given the uncertainti in the economi  which you describ in your remark  i would accept and in fact would support a move of    basi point if we are go to move at all   and sinc we are deal with the issu of uncertainti  i think have a balanc risk statement is a prudent way to do it   so i support you in your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support you   let me give my reason   first  given what we   ve seen in term of the incom data  the mark down of forecast  et cetera  it   s import for us to maintain the same degre of s ulus that we had befor at our last meet   if we look at and visual adjust exhibit   in     s handout  both the top and the bottom chart suggest that    basi point is the best way to do that   that  i think  pick up what jerri jordan was impli and perhap other as well   second  on the balanc of risk statement  boy oh boy am i glad we adopt that procedur   laughter   have labor with mani of you on it and have listen to     s interpret  i am comfort with a balanc statement with respect to the risk becaus of what he has shown in the bottom portion of exhibit     and i was not be faceti about be glad we decid to includ the risk statement in our announc   i think it   s help that we got away from signal thing between meet  though i realiz it leav some other kind of uncertainti   but by and larg i think if we do a    basi point cut    look at the forecast   has shown for the         period in the lower fund rate path scenario   one can intellectu  credibl support a balanc risk statement   i will leav it to you and presid   to talk about the market psycholog   i can   t disagre with what you both said   it seem credibl    there   s a slight misunderstand between ben bernank and me regard what i was say earlier   i don   t think i   m disagre with you  ben   i firm believ that make these adjust will help busi to lower the cost of capit and to get refocus on the need to make further invest go forward   i   m not sure that we disagre at all   we can talk about that later   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i support a cut of    basi point   i   m delight to support      i  frank  would have a modest prefer to retain the asymmetri in the risk statement becaus i think to go    and move to balanc make us look too confid that we understand the situat   it seem as though we   re say about the patient  the sick economi  that we   re go to do this  and certain that ought to be enough for you   and it may look too fanci  as if we   re tri to fine tune the dosag   but this is not a big issu with me  and i   ve had enough of be a curmudgeon  so i   ll support the    and a balanc risk statement   laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend  as for the    basi point cut  i think we need it   recent data are suffici worrisom and the most like forecast is suffici tepid to justifi    basi point   and i do think it would feed through to long term interest rate   look at     s chart of the upward slope expect feder fund rate  if the market see us move a littl more aggress  i think that could flatten that chart out a littl  and the effect would feed through to longer term interest rate   and for the reason that governor   and bernank note  i think that would help the economi    i was particular taken  mr  chairman  by your descript of the cost of miss on either side   with a sizabl output gap and low inflat and inflat expect  the odd on eas so much now that we produc inflat down the road seem veri  veri small   but if weak persist or if the economi is subject to a downsid shock  the cost of move too  id at this stage could be consider  on the balanc of risk  this is a tough call in larg measur becaus  whatev we do  sluggish growth and declin inflat are the most like outcom for a few quarter   but in my mind the more aggress action   buy a degre of assur about more satisfactori outcom over the slight longer term   and from that perspect  howev murki it may be  the risk may well be about balanc   moreov  i am concern that retain the unbalanc risk assess along with a    basi point reduct in rate could leav the impress that the feder reserv see the econom situat as more serious than i believ it probabl is and that we   re will to cut rate further than i believ we should with the inform now in hand
at the last meet or mayb even at the last two meet  i could have gone with a    basi point reduct in rate and call it insur   so i   m clear in the camp of reduc rate   and given the incom data     basi point probabl is a better insur polici than     i find this discuss of the balanc of risk pretti t i   on the point that    includ in exhibit     that the committe might retain unbalanc risk if in the near term resourc slack is expect to build   whether we reduc the fund rate by    basi point or not  resourc slack is expect to build in the near term   even the gdp growth number shown in the forecast for      h  are not robust  though i guess they do get back to   percent by then   but   gdp growth in h  is still go to seem rather slow  and that  e frame is my definit of the near term  as you know  i meet with a group of invest profession befor each fomc meet  and i have to echo a littl of what bill pool said about a move of    basi point  these observ felt that the outlook was dicey enough that their sens was a cut of    as oppos to    might make a negat splash in the market   in their view     might make peopl even more uncertain and concern  and they might think that we see someth wors than they see   i think the balanc risk statement help to offset that   so i   m a littl at odd with the logic and the market impact of your recommend  but i   m will to go along with it
mr  chairman  i think we face a differ situat from the one we were face a year or so ago when i made the comment that you refer to   so  if i had my druther  i person would continu to be patient a littl while longer than jack guynn and tom hoenig suggest   but if we eas   and i have thought through this as i expect that the committe would eas this  e   i have a strong prefer for a    point reduct rather than onli a   point reduct   a    basi point drop would be decis   i think it would give us a fight chanc of preempt the downsid forc that you discuss and that i recogn certain exist in the economi   to me a   point move would be the worst of the three altern laid out in the bluebook becaus i think it probabl would rais the most doubt and uncertainti about monetari polici go forward   so i   m comfort with the    basi point  i think we need to act decis rather than tentat  on the tilt  i must say i   m a littl ambival   i wish i had more  e to think through this issu of the risk statement  but my instinct is that we ought to leav it unbalanc   i say that   main becaus  if we   re go to eas and accept whatev longer term upsid risk may flow from that  i   d like to maxim the chanc that this polici action is go to do the job complet   this is not an issu that i would fall on my sword over  but i person would have a prefer for retain the tilt toward weak
mr  chairman  to me it make a lot of sens to go with the    basi point cut  one that is larg enough to have a notic effect   my main concern about this larg cut is that it might send the messag that the economi is weaker than we current think   but by adopt a risk assess that is balanc i believ we mitig that possibl   so i think in combin it   s the right choic
presid  n
mr  chairman  i support the    basi point reduct in the fund rate target   i think there   s a good chanc that it   s the right thing to do   but even if it   s not  as you alreadi suggest  the risk of take this action seem low basic becaus of the situat in which we could find ourselv with regard to product and current and prospect inflat  as far as the balanc of risk is concern  despit the natur of the disappoint news come in  i suspect the risk aren   t all that unbalanc to begin with   so i have no problem with move to a balanc risk statement
mr  chairman  i support the recommend to cut the fund rate by    basi point   i agre with the argument that    basi point would lead to market expect that anoth    is come  and i think it   s much better to act decis   yes  it   s probabl true that some peopl will say in reaction to        oh my god  the fed think the economi is realli   veri weak      that may well be the interpret of some   but i think the reaction of other    that we are act decis as we have in the past   will overwhelm that concern  there are alway risk   we   ve talk a lot about the downsid risk and what a pickl we would be in if they were to accumul   on the upsid risk  i think it would be absolut delight to deal with upsid strength   laughter  but we   re not discuss that situat   there is no question that we would be abl to increas rate in  e   we have a lot invest in inflat credibl  and this is the  e to take some return on that capit   i just don   t think there   s ani  issu on that whatsoev  i would not myself go for the balanc risk statement   i believ the market interpret of the balanc risk statement would probabl have two piec to it   first  that we   re make a statement that we   re finish reduc rate   as i see it  that would minim the chanc that the reduct would carri into longer term rate   second  it may appear awkward if incom data remain weak over the next few week  which i don   t think is beyond the realm of possibl at all   the balanc risk statement would then rais question as to our judgment about the outlook becaus i think it would be interpret in the light of the data we see in come week   so in my view the best cours would be to retain the tilt toward weak   to introduc someth new that appear to cut in the opposit direct of the    basi point cut would be more confus than help to the market   so i   d simpli leav that part of the statement alon
mr  chairman  i agre with both part of your recommend   i believ it is a good insur polici against downsid risk   on the risk statement  it   s a close call  but on balanc i think it is better to go the way you suggest in order to reduc the unintend negat consequ if we were to keep the tilt toward weaker econom growth   i   agre with bill   in that i don   t think this preclud us in ani way from do anyth in the futur if we had to   i certain agre with that  i do want to pick up on one point that bill pool talk about  and that is the issu you  rais that this economi may turn around more quick than we might anticip   we all certain hope it     what that mean is that we do have to be care becaus  if the economi   turn around quick  we have to be will to rais rate at the appropri  e   we all know it   s a lot easier to cut rate than to rais them
i support your recommend   i see the two part of the recommend as essenti and necessarili togeth   i   d feel a littl less comfort with the notion of    basi point and the risk toward weak becaus i think the market would respond as sever peopl have suggest   the altern of a slight more posit touch with    basi point and a tilt toward weak had some appeal to me  and i struggl with that  presid   suggest that favor that would describ me as a wimp   i would prefer to think of it as be relat conserv and deliber    laughter
there   s a differ    laughter
in ani case  i think it clear is necessari that we respond to the econom forc as we see them   so i can inde support the recommend
mr  chairman  i can support the recommend   i would be more than a littl uncomfort with    basi point and the continu of an asymmetr risk assess   i hope we can use the press statement to suggest that we know how to look beyond the next coupl of data releas and that we see a better economi down the road   i wish i were a   littl surer and more comfort with exact how a polici chang of this kind work it way through to both long term rate and to the shorter term consum spend that is interest insensit   it   s not quit as clear to me as it seem to be to other that that will work   i have alway hate to disappoint my kid at christma  e   i suspect there is a santa claus  but he may not be abl to deliv quit as mani present or as big a packag this year   so i have some doubt that monetari polici realli work it way through the various sector quit as clean as some peopl suggest   but i can support the recommend  and i understand the argument that have been made
mr  chairman  i support the recommend to go down    basi point on the fund rate   i think we need to show that we are ahead at this point in the economi   i find it a littl harder on the balanc of risk statement   one of the reason   use some of the word that   put in his handout   is that we talk about the forese futur   as a group we have come to the conclus that the economi is at sort of an inflect point where we think there is weak in the veri short term but go out further in our forecast period we see more strength   i can support the balanc risk statement  but i think it   s import to indic that the    forese futur    is beyond the next meet becaus some peopl tend to look at the risk statement as a signal about our like polici stanc at the next meet   so if we can talk past the short run in the press releas  i think that would be help
when i began review the  book inform  i had a reaction to it that i didn   t expect   as i was read through it  i heard the theme that the current news is disappoint  but the economi was still seen as pois for acceler growth at some point in   the futur   and it struck me that i had been read that same thing  e after  e after  e  as i thought about that  it seem to me that it was not a reflect of our abil to model nor a reflect of our abil to understand the data   i think we are read the data accur   but in everi other environ i   ve ever experienc in my life  that sequenc just scream    do someth      now  this is the first  e i   ve been in a monetari polici environ  so i came into the meet tri to get an understand of what the downsid risk would be of an aggress move   and i think i   m persuad that the downsid risk of move the fund rate down are fair well mitig   also  a balanc risk statement seem to me to suggest what we   ve been say all along  that the fundament are still in place for a turnaround   so i support both part of the recommend
mr  chairman  i also support both part of the recommend   i think    basi point is just right   i would be less concern about retain the bias toward weak on the ground that the market survey data suggest that there   s essenti a univers expect that we will retain that bias even when peopl anticip a    basi point declin   so i don   t think that we would creat a shock   nevertheless  i defer to those who have been in market and understand their deep psycholog   so i do concur with the recommend
i agre enthusiast with your recommend of    basi point   i think the way the bias is usual interpret the more honest thing to do is to keep the bias in a downward direct   but i agre with governor bie that  if we could make it clear that we   re look some distanc out in the futur  then it would be okay to go to a balanc risk statement    and i do want to make it balanc becaus of the consider that bill   mention
okay   would the secretari read the languag
this languag is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     with regard to the balanc of risk sentenc for the press statement     against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are balanc with respect to prospect for both goal in the forese futur
call the roll
chairman  spa vice chairman   governor bernank governor bie governor   governor    presid jorda governor kohn presid   governor olson presid santomero  presid
i   d like to take a short recess and ask the member of the yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes     board of governor to gather in my offic to act on the request on the discount rate   in the interim we can distribut the draft press statement and ask everybodi to take a look at it     recess
the board member need some  e to read the statement  question   presid jordan
the first paragraph mention the discount rate action but without identifi the reserv bank whose pend action have been approv   is that go to be  ad
that will be ad   there are two bank request a    basi point reduct  new york and dalla   the standard procedur  as you all know  is that other come in later in the day or the follow day   there is a question  in fact  given the introduct of our new procedur earli next year  as to whether we should be do anyth differ now   i think the general consensus is that it   s far better to stay with exact what we   ve been do   and then on januari    we will make the actual chang when we move to the new lombard rate discount facil   if there are no further comment  i   ll assum this draft  statement is adequ for our purpos   now  let me ask   what his view is as to the  e need for the next agenda item
well  it might be more effici to have this discuss over lunch

thank you  mr  chairman   recent    reinhart and i sent a memo to the committe on the soma altern asset studi   befor we turn to the main part of today   s discuss  let me just remind you that in march we sought guidanc from the committe on priorit resourc for the continu of our work on this issu   at that  e the committe instruct the staff to focus first on the possibl of buy ginni mae outright for the portfolio and second on the possibl of accept foreign sovereign debt as collater on repo   but committe member indic that to the extent there was a resourc conflict   and there was    the staff was to finish conting plan for tri parti repo at our third site   so from the  e of that meet through about the august septemb  e frame we were focus almost exclus on finish the work on conting plan  and onli recent have we begun to look at the issu of how ginni mae might fit into our outright portfolio   given that limit amount of  e  most of our work has been in the area of preparatori plan   think about how long certain task might take  especi some of the settlement account  front offic work  risk manag  and veri critic the system chang that might need to be made  each of these issu is surmount  but the work involv is  e consum   and if the committe were to approv expand the allow asset in the system open market account to includ ginni mae secur  the  e befor we actual would begin buy them would be measur not in week but more like in month and quarter   it probabl would take at least eighteen month or so befor we could make all the necessari arrang and begin to implement such a decis   in the interim  anoth element of the work that the fomc had commiss is readi for the committe   s review  and that is the studi the staff has finish on the auction credit facil     lang led that work  so let me turn the floor over to him  to describ the paper on that issu  which you also receiv recent

let me conclud the staff portion of these remark by explain what dino and i hope to get from the committe this afternoon   basic  we   d like your advic on what portion of five differ item you want us to continu to work on and what  e frame  if you do want us to work on them  you think would be reason   specif  we   re ask whether you want addit studi on     purchas outright mortgag back secur underwritten by ginni mae      acquir foreign sovereign secur as collater for temporari dollar transact      develop an auction credit facil to complement desk oper  and     use an auction credit facil to substitut for desk oper in an emerg  the fifth item concern the public of the materi that the staff present to the committe in januari        as you recal  at that  e there was a desir to get those materi into the public domain to inform both the academ and the invest communiti about the option the committe was look at   in addit  it seem desir to have those in academia and the market think harder about the issu the system should consid in determin what to put on the book of the system open market account   so the fifth item we   re ask for is approv to publish this staff studi in the upcom intermeet period onc final edit are complet   we   re not seek a vote  as this studi is not an offici document of the feder open market committe  the feder reserv board  or feder reserv bank   we intend to includ a foreword to the document that will make that explicit  the foreword will also includ an explan that the studi is a histor document that repres what we understood in januari      and has not been updat   that need to be said in part becaus of   and the committe hasn   t discuss them   some procedur chang that have evolv sinc then  includ import the adopt of the lombard facil   if you have ani particular advic about what els should be in that foreword  we   d appreci have it   in summari  those are the issu on which dino and i would like to get your view today
mr  chairman  start out with the fifth point  it seem to me that it is a veri good staff studi  and i hope that it will be releas at some point for public comment and discuss   as for the option suggest for addit studi  i favor consider of the purchas of ginni mae secur   where such fulli feder guarante debt is avail  there is a presumpt  i believ  that it should be includ in our portfolio   and if i rememb correct  at our previous meet there was consider support for look at that altern  i also like the propos for the acf   it seem to me that the experi we would get from the acf would be use for creat a conting acf if that were need   given current project for the feder budget  howev  we are not press for  e on these altern
you say that with a smile   for the offici record  we will indic that he smile    laughter
it may be use to initi small ginni mae and acf pilot program in order to gain some experi   you ask also about the  e   i would suggest  somewhat arbitrarili  six to twelv month of further studi of those two option and a subsequ updat to the committe
befor we proceed  could i just ask a question   i  too   think that it is worthwhil publish the studi     anyon have ani object to that  sever   no
can i assum that it   s the committe   s judgment that we  do so
the committe   s inform judgment
yes  inform judgment   it   s the separ judgment of individu member of the committe   is that correct
mr  chairman
mention that when this studi goe out to the public it would have a cover memo or foreword   i think it would be help to note that we are chang the way a lot of our facil can work  requir perhap differ type of facil   we might note whi this  would involv remov the stigma from borrow   the bank would be post collater and might be look to manag that differ   i think we at least ought to acknowledg that the lombard facil is go to be introduc   i wasn   t around for the committe discuss of these paper  and i   m not sure if the lombard facil was anticip   but just a few comment in the cover memo about how that studi relat to where we   re move on the lombard might be help in order to make that current
right   we can includ that in the foreword and also in the first footnot to the acf discuss in the studi itself
governor  if i might comment   we didn   t know at the  e that the system was go to proceed with the lombard facil   but within the acf or discount window altern portion of the studi  there was a comment that the acf could work with either an adjust credit or with a lombard style facil
my chairman  not unrel to the fact that a lot of the work done on these studi is done by peopl at the new york reserv bank  i would  suggest that we ask the staff to concentr on the ginni mae studi and get that done at some reason pace   after that is brought back to the committe to look at  then we could decid   whether there is a need to move on the other studi   otherwis  i think we   re overload the staff unnecessarili
there   s also the interest question as to the relationship between the ginni mae studi and the reason for the studi   rememb  we start off with a presumpt that we   d have a shortag of treasuri secur
we had a worthwhil discuss becaus there was a probabl that such a shortag could happen   that probabl is now gone for the forese futur   but the issu of whether ginni mae should be part of the soma portfolio is a separ issu
exact   that   s whi i think that is worth pursu
i agre with the vice chairman   s recommend   it seem to me that acquir ginni mae is a veri natur extens of what we   re do now   we alreadi buy full faith and credit paper  it   s not obvious whi we   re not buy this other full faith and credit paper  i think it also may be a use pilot project for learn how to outsourc some of our function  deal with more complex secur  and deal with other intermediari   so i think we   ll learn a lot by studi this that might be use some  down the line  i also think the acf work is terrif  and an acf has a lot of appeal   but we   ve put into place some other emerg facil  includ the emerg primari credit facil associ with the new lombard facil and backup for the desk   so i don   t feel that we need to develop an acf in order to get a cacf the way i thought we did a year or two ago   we have other   backup now   so the acf is a more radic propos in a sens   it has more problem associ with it  though i like the propos if we have to go that way   and i certain thank   and his peopl for the incred amount of work they did on this paper   we can keep it on the shelf and come back to it and see whether we think it   s a good idea onc we deal with the ginni mae issu   so  i agre with the vice chairman
mr  chairman  i   m on board with the ginni mae   i think it make sens   i said that when we met in earli        i   m interest in a littl more studi on the acf issu   look at the feder debt project  the need for that kind of facil has been push off  so i certain recogn that we   re not in a rush   but i think it also is someth we ought to give more thought to and establish a  e frame for further studi   mayb  as bob parri said  twelv month or so is appropri   in ani event  it would be veri help in my view to work out some of the detail should we come to a point where we want to look at the acf altern more serious  you ask about the foreign sovereign debt issu  and i don   t know that anyon has  comment on it   i thought the inclin last  e was not to go in that direct  part for polit reason and especi if ginni mae prove workabl or if we decid to keep the acf as an altern   so i would put the foreign sovereign debt conting on hold as well  and i would like to add my kudo to the qualiti of the paper on the acf   it was realli great  in term of address the technic question that are outlin in that memo  which i recogn are import  the staff wouldn   t necessarili have to come back to the committe for discuss   but if you want our comment  we could send them to you
certain that would be help
mr  chairman  i still think the best substitut for treasuri secur is no substitut  but i   ll leav it at that becaus of the reaction i got the last  e i tri to push  that view   i agre with other who support the further studi of ginni mae   that certain seem to be a natur thing to do   they   re essenti equival to treasuri secur  person  i have strong reserv about the auction credit facil either as a complement to desk oper in normal  e or as a substitut in an emerg   this is in no way a comment on the staff studi   i thought the studi was veri help     in our effort to think through these issu   clear  this kind of facil would have an advantag if we were in a situat where we had to add a lot of reserv to the system  given the limit on the volum of ginni mae avail for purchas  the acf would be an altern  i recogn that   but there are at least a coupl of veri signific problem and  obvious  they were cite in the studi   first and foremost for me  i think an acf could serious compromis the abil of our supervisori staff to downgrad a larger institut when that might result in it loss of access to an acf facil   i think  in practic  it would be veri  veri difficult to keep advers inform on a bank institut confidenti   so by establish an acf we would be creat potenti a    too big to downgrad    problem  which is a situat i don   t think we want to get into  to me  this is a serious enough problem that i would not want to pursu this cours further   frank  with the reemerg of feder deficit  i don   t think anyon expect a lack of treasuri debt to be a problem ani  e in the forese futur   and if the facil were avail  i think it would be tempt to use it for other purpos   in particular  we might be tempt to use it if the economi weaken sharpli and we were either at or near the zero bound   and need to add a substanti quantiti of reserv in such a situat   but it would be precis in that kind of environ where signific danger would aris if we were reluct to downgrad problem bank  with particular refer to the propos about a conting acf for emerg situat  at this point i don   t see ani great advantag in that if i understand it correct   we  have this new lombard facil come in with a provis that would allow the reserv bank to drop the discount rate to the fund rate in an emerg situat   so i guess i don   t see what this facil would add to what we would have in place onc the new lombard facil is introduc
i   m close to where presid hoenig is   the ginni mae make sens to me  and i think we should continu to pursu how that might happen   and i believ it would be use to look at the acf altern in direct comparison with ginni mae to see whi we would need the acf if we had ginni mae  on the question of whether or not we need a cacf as a conting arrang i think we should turn to governor   and say     do  we have enough conting arrang      if his crisi manag group want to take the cacf off the tabl becaus it   s no longer perceiv as necessari  that   s fine  we should rememb that  with the treasuri   s auction of tt l balanc  we actual have had a lot more experi over the last fifteen month than we had befor about how such a system would work   in mani respect the acf could be view as that kind of structur   so  my prefer would be for the staff to continu with the ginni mae  which are a logic extens of our current practic  and to do a littl more homework on the acf   i   d have the staff come back to the committe and say     here are the cost and benefit of each of these  how   do you wish to proceed      and in that sens my view come closer to presid parri   s in term of look at both of them for a while and then figur out where we want to end up
i tend to think we should focus on the ginni mae   i   d have the staff do that studi and bring it back to this committe and then we can decid whether that   s suffici to address the problem or not  i have some question about whether we need an acf   given resourc constraint   and sinc we have plenti of  e here as we all know   my prefer would be to start with the ginni mae  get that done and assess that  and then decid whether ani further work is necessari   also  let me note that our bank   have some technic comment on the acf  which we can send in  just to put a marker down for futur use   and on the conting acf  i have some question  too  as to whether we realli need it at this point  given everyth els we   ve done
thank you   i think i   m general with presid   and other  i would put much more emphasi on ginni mae sinc we understand the legal ramif there in that they are public secur   they   re a step away from treasuri but not that big a step  i would be cautious about an acf  and i am veri concern  as all of you know  about resourc util   therefor  i would tend to downplay that altern   not that it   s unimport and not that we don   t alreadi have a lot of good staff work done   but i   m worri about all the other compet resourc requir   so i would agre with the suggest of presid   and other to postpon further consider of the acf    with respect to the conting acf  i think two of you have ask the relev question   governor kohn and other have alreadi suggest an answer  which is that given the general amount of work that has alreadi gone into develop backup facil  the cacf is not like to reach a high prioriti in our think   the conting plan group has made a larg invest  both physic and intellectu  in a number of other approach  includ the lombard facil   so given my general respons for conting work  i would be veri comfort take the cacf off the tabl at this stage   again  good work has been done on this  our understand of it has move beyond where we were when we put that idea on the tabl   so in conclus  i think ginni mae should be where most of the staff work is direct  all the other altern i would say can now be delay for some  e
i   m in favor of what governor    governor kohn  and presid   said   i   d do the work on the ginni mae first and learn from our acf effort but put it on the shelf   if peopl have comment on it  fine  submit them   also  when we put the staff studi out  they do mention an acf type facil  though nowher near     page are devot to it as in the paper we receiv recent    laughter   it is mention  so perhap we   ll  get some respons from those in academia or other on how they see some of those facil   i think that might be instruct
mr  chairman  i too would agre that the ginni mae should be our first prioriti   it seem to me that foreign debt has a whole host of risk associ with it   polit  credit  and exchang risk   i like the way that don kohn and al broaddus particular talk  about the acf and the cacf   i think we could come back to them after we have some   experi with the new lombard facil and perhap make that facil even more usabl in an emerg situat   so i agre that we should put both asid for the moment and come back to then later if we decid we don   t have adequ coverag
anybodi els   do you have an adequ respons on  this
we have more than suffici direct  mr  chairman    laughter
a wee bit more than adequ
i hesit to tri to summar this   i   ve alway want to be in the posit of the congress  when they pass an ambigu law and then just say to other     you solv it
i would suggest that dino and i go back and look at the transcript of  this discuss  laughter  and solv that problem   one thing that   s clear is that dino will be studi the option associ with acquir ginni mae and then we   ll get back to the committe to
i do think that the issu of limit resourc is not a minor question   when we began examin this  there was a   in    chanc that those budget surplus realli would arriv and that we would find ourselv in a veri difficult posit with regard to soma   so we had no choic but to look at the option   the likelihood of surplus has dissip  and the rest of the work now is larg discretionari   the question is  is a particular issu suffici worthwhil in the broad aspect of feder reserv oper to use the resourc   and that   s a judgment that i suspect the two of you could make far better than ani of us
i think some guidanc we might add is that the staff ought to pursu this as they can   not by hire new peopl or by work over   but they ought to take it serious   if it take you six month or twelv month  that   s not go to endang the republ
on the ginni mae  you mean
let me make one other point   i agre with what other have said about leav some of the tough judgment to the staff to make   on the conting issu  howev  we have invest a lot in conting plan  and i don   t think there   s ani reason to spend anoth minut on it at this stage   while i would leav it to the staff to figur out how to proceed on the acf and other issu  i definit want the cacf   and i think it is the sens of the committe as well   to be taken off the tabl
from what i heard  and i hope dino agre  the committe has taken off the tabl accept foreign sovereign debt as collater at this  e  and has also taken off the tabl a conting acf   the first order of prioriti  in term of staff studi  is acquir ginni mae outright in the portfolio   and you   re defer to our judgment the issu of when resourc are avail for further studi of an acf   the sequenc may veri well be that we will come back to the committe with a document about ginni mae and ask at that  e what you would like to hear about an acf
what i would propos then is that at some point over the next few month  at a meet next year  we come back to the committe with a propos for what a ginni mae program would look like   that is  we   d tri to give you some concret sens of the size of the program that we would envis and how we would buy the ginni mae   with the front offic there are some account issu that we might be abl to resolv by then   we would tri to   assess the implic in term of cost so that you have a sens of what it would cost the system or the new york fed to do this   so the next document would be more concret than the general approach that we have taken to date when we   ve been look at altern approach  that would be my suggest for some  e earli next year
i agre complet   i would urg you to make sure that the cost issu are inde on the tabl   we may find out that the shadow price of our involv in that market is suffici high that we want to look at altern   or we may want to conclud that it   s not worth the money   i   m not suggest you would do that  but if we have that sort of inform in front of us rather explicit  it will give us a better sens of what is realli involv
dino has alreadi been told that he has no room for expand the budget for this   not two sous more than what he alreadi has in the budget
okay  this termin the offici fomc meet    end of meet
