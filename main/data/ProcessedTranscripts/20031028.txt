we   re readi to start our meet   would somebodi like to move the minut of the septemb meet
i   ll move the minut of that meet
thank you   without object they are approv   dino  you   re on
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were circul a short while ago   dure the first part of the intermeet period  market particip look at incom data and conclud that the glass was half empti  then for most of octob  they tend to see the glass as half full   interest rate develop larg mirror these shift view   the other topic that has occupi market in the aftermath of the g   summit in dubai is the dollar   s exchang rate and the feedback effect that a further fall in the dollar might have on asset market   the top panel on page   graph u s  and euro area three month cash deposit rate and the three month rate three  six  and nine month forward   dure much of septemb  market were disappoint by u s  data  culmin with the weaker than expect chicago pmi and consum confid number report on septemb     and u s  forward rate  the dash red line  fell sharpli   howev  start with the septemb employ number  releas on octob    the outlook began to take on a more posit tone   gdp forecast were upward revis  and forward rate start move higher   comment by presid parri and treasuri secretari snow in mid octob caus market particip to price in a higher likelihood that short

compani   on balanc  forward rate are rough where they were in late august   short term rate in the euro area  both cash and forward  the   line  travers the same general path as u s  rate  as the outlook there was also perceiv to be a bit more posit  onc again  euro area rate tend to show a more pronounc reaction to u s  data and announc than to european one   yield in the treasuri market also follow the same general pattern  as shown in the bottom two panel on page     when ten year yield briefli fell below   percent  some market strategist specul that anoth wave of convex hedg by mortgag account might kick in   in the event  that did not materi   howev  even without that  treasuri yield across the curv were choppi on a day to day    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     basi   the ten year note of may       which is now onc off the run  has continu to trade with a high degre of scarciti valu in financ market and with a high level of fail   in earlier meet when i was ask about the fail situat  i said that it was larg a back offic event that had not spill over into the cash market  howev  in the past week we have note a decreas in transact volum in this note  and it has begun trade veri rich relat to the current on the run ten year note   the may ten year note is now yield about    basi point less than the on the run august ten year note  and the issu is trade at negat rate in the repo market  given the veri limit suppli and report that more investor are demand deliveri  it is not at all clear how this situat will resolv itself   despit the up and down of the treasuri market  spread continu to narrow  as shown at the top of page    the invest grade spread  shown in the top left panel  continu to narrow   this index hit a low of     basi point on octob      the last  e the spread was that narrow was in april        high yield and emerg market debt spread also narrow  as shown in the right panel   the high yield index narrow to a low of     basi point  the lowest level in about   year  while the embi  spread hit it lowest level in     year   a year ago the spread on both of these index were at about       basi point   while a narrow of spread is expect dure an econom rebound as the qualiti of credit improv  sever strategist are voic concern about whether a liquid driven ralli has push spread to unsustain level   particular in the emerg market sector   the appar lack of fear also show through in some volatil index   the middl panel graph the volatil index on the s p      also known as the vix   on octob     the vix hit a low of      percent  it lowest level in more than three year   now  one volatil measur that rose was that of the dollar   s exchang rate  the bottom panel graph the one month impli volatil of the euro   dollar and dollar   yen exchang rate  as shown in that panel  the volatil of the dollar   yen exchang rate  which had been trap in a narrow rang by japanes intervent  spike higher   from   percent to more than    percent in the day surround the dubai summit and coincid with the suspens of japanes intervent activ  the g   summit in dubai gave the market a lot to mull over   the dollar had alreadi been under downward pressur befor the summit   that  coupl with statement from the administr earlier in septemb push for more exchang rate flexibl among asian currenc  made the market look cautious toward the summit  but most observ did not expect much from the communiqu©   in the event  reaction to the communiqu© rang along a wide spectrum   some view it as a mileston that final buri the so call    strong dollar    polici  some were confus about what  if anyth  the g   was say  and some were convinc that noth had chang and that the communiqu© did not signifi ani polici shift by the g     in that environ it is not surpris that the dollar continu under some downward pressur   the top panel on the next page graph the euro   s valu against the dollar   after a dip in late august  the euro appreci sharpli in the run up to dubai and in subsequ day   european policymak at that point were express some concern that the bulk of ani adjust to the dollar   s exchang rate would have to be born by the euro if mani asian currenc in particular continu to be fix against the dollar   asian currenc appreci somewhat against the dollar  as shown in the middl panel  with the except of the chines yuan  which continu at it fix rate   some central bank react with tradit intervent to stem the rise of their currenc  other resort to capit control  restrict on access to local bank system  and various form of moral suasion   although the chines yuan spot rate stay fix  the upward pressur on the yuan show through in the nondeliver forward  ndf  market where the one year ndf impli a     percent appreci of the currenc   the hong kong dollar also strengthen in the day after dubai  at first without action from the hong kong monetari author   given the currenc board system in hong kong  the lack of intervent surpris those who were short hong kong dollar and had perceiv the currenc board to be symmetr   the action taken by a number of central bank in the region have ad a sens of two way risk to asian currenc rate  which perhap was lack befor  a less favor view express by some was that a new risk premium had been introduc into asian market   in ani case  with reserv level in asia rise  trader are ask a number of question   what is the end game for this process   how do these countri counter capit inflow   do the central bank have the instrument to  il their foreign exchang intervent   and that list  sn   t even includ the broader macroeconom question that are relev  such as the risk of overh economi   the bottom panel graph the dollar   yen exchang rate   that rate had trade in a narrow rang until septemb     when the japanes stop interven  the rate prompt depreci sharpli to the     region  whereupon the ministri of financ  mof  again resum intervent   this morn the yen dollar exchang rate hit a three year low of        amid token intervent by the author   dure the period  the mof purchas       billion  includ      million that the desk purchas as agent on behalf of the japanes author   given the larg scale of japanes intervent this year  i thought i   d spend a few minut on this topic   the top panel of page   depict net year intervent by the japanes monetari author sinc        with two month left in       the mof   s intervent exceed      billion so far this year   more than doubl the previous high   the middl panel show how japanes intervent has evolv over the year  each dot is a daili intervent purchas or sale of dollar over the period from      to date   between      and mid       japanes intervent tend to be frequent  but each oper was relat modest in size   at least by later standard   with a chang in leadership at the ministri of financ in mid      came a differ intervent style   over the next seven year  japanes intervent episod were much less frequent but much larger in size   individu oper were frequent larger than    billion and in a few case more than     billion   iron  the largest singl oper is   appropri perhap   off the chart and was a sale of     billion dollar in april        for refer purpos  the largest dollar   yen intervent by the u s  monetari author was      million in june        sinc the begin of        coincid with anoth leadership chang at the mof   japanes intervent tactic have shift yet again  intervent this year have been frequent and larg   in short  the two previous style have been combin   the bottom panel look at the effect of japanes intervent on volatil dure the major intervent episod in the last nine year   the red bar show the intraday rang  express in yen  on day the mof did not interven  and the blue bar show the rang on day when it did interven   sinc intervent typic impart some inform to the market   whether that is intend or not   market general react with a higher degre of movement than usual  and volatil rise   inde  that is the pattern we observ   howev  dure the januari to juli      period  this tradit and expect pattern   not appli   the daili rang was actual lower on intervent day  suggest that intervent was constrain the    normal    elbow room  if you will  that the exchang rate use in a typic day   that is also consist with a strategi that appear to be aim at prevent the exchang rate from move further rather than at attempt to engin a revers   mr  chairman  onc again  the desk did not conduct ani foreign oper in this period  i will need a vote to ratifi domest oper
it look as though each of the two type of intervent oper had some modest effect on the exchang rate and  when combin  that disappear  do i infer from what you   re say that the two earlier mof regim actual had some modest effect on the exchang rate but the combin method did not
well  i   m not sure i would go that far
i knew you wouldn   t    laughter
academ have long argu about the effect of intervent   certain the size of the japanes intervent has been incred this year
it   s even arguabl as to whether it   s  il
that   s yet anoth set of issu   nevertheless  the rate is about    yen lower than it was at the end of last year despit this veri  veri larg intervent   compound the situat is the question of whether the intervent is  il or not
i   ve been wonder out loud recent whether the extraordinarili signific bias on the part of commerci bank and household in japan not to engag in a signific way in the purchas of foreign asset   far more so than is true in the world at larg   is a factor     carri that over into the intern exchang market creat a bias in favor of the yen   if so  that essenti mean that the equilibrium price of the yen vis  vis the dollar would tend to be higher than would ordinarili be the case if there were capit flow more reminisc of what we   ve seen in the past in europ and the unit state
i don   t think i would argu with that   in fact  one of the point that comment have made over the year is that  in the absenc of the japanes financi system be abl to recycl these fund  it is left to the author  through intervent  to do that  even so  the scale of this year   s intervent is veri larg and far exceed the current account surplus   so they   re recycl the current account and then some   the amount of intervent is quit pronounc this year
my second question relat to the issu of how the foreign exchang market are function   there is consider bias in forecast current toward a weaker dollar  larg as a consequ of the rise u s  current account deficit   yet we   re all taught  and the market seem to suggest  that the spot rate captur all of the forward suppli and demand as well as the spot through arbitrag oper   larg becaus of the over the counter deriv market one can go out ten  fifteen year in ani of these major currenc  consequ there is an arbitrag interact along the matur schedul of forward contract  which ul  fix the spot rate   if that is inde the case  it suggest that all market knowledg is effect embodi in the spot rate and that  therefor  forecast a chang is a contradict in term   is it correct to say that these foreign exchang market are suffici sophist and deep that essenti all of the inform is embodi in the spot rate so that forecast is base on the presumpt that one know someth that the market   not know
i have watch foreign exchang market for about eleven year  which is nowher near as long as you   ve been watch them  and i would never want to forecast exchang rate becaus it seem so imposs to do   so that   s my first point   on your second question   whether the spot rate captur all the inform that is knowabl   i wouldn   t even want to ventur a guess   i don   t know if   want to give us some view on this question
well  i   m foolish go to offer to say someth on this subject   laughter   the dilemma with the arbitrag reason that you have accur laid out is that one end or the other of the term structur of exchang rate impli by it need to be nail down in some way for that by itself to tell you where the spot rate should be   regrett  that   s the piec that is miss   it   s not that the arbitrag condit fail  and it   s not that the respect interest rate differenti don   t give you a whole term structur at some level of movement in the spot rate   the problem is that nowher is it attach to a level
algebra i don   t necessarili agre with you   in other word  let   s say we have an aggreg suppli and demand for a commod   the reason work the same way for a commod   with segreg with respect to the  e frame   there is a sens in which the aggreg suppli and demand equat to get an averag price  and that term structur is essenti a function of the differ level of suppli and demand along that period spectrum
but the magic term is    aggreg suppli      what pin down the aggreg suppli of a currenc
i   m not say what pin it down  i   m just say that it exist   algebra you have enough observ to solv the problem
in real  e on a given day  at a particular minut  a certain suppli exist and the price equat demand to it  yes
that   s all i   m say
but in an attempt  base on theoret reason  to determin what shock should do to that system or what the futur rate should be and so forth  the issu is that the suppli of a currenc has no econom behind it   the suppli could be anyth
i don   t know what those word mean
there are no paramet of a suppli curv that are driven by incent as there would be  say  if we were talk about the price of lumber in a year   for exampl  one can think about the reason behind the action of the peopl who buy lumber and of the peopl who sell lumber   and one could  right or wrong  write down curv that describ that behavior and thus predict a price base on them
well  i   m just say that there is a futur price for lumber   and i would submit that all along the curv of the futur market for lumber is in effect an arbitrag oper  which is fix at a level that encompass the aggreg demand and suppli all the way out on the futur curv
but recal that each exchang rate involv two currenc   so in the case we   re discuss  one is implicit talk about the suppli of dollar and the suppli of yen  while a certain suppli exist in calendar  e at this moment  noth predetermin the suppli of either currenc go forward   both of those variabl might move in a way that market can   t predict   so the arbitrag theori
i acknowledg that the market can   t predict  that   s the problem   but unless somebodi insist that this issu is import to the decis we have to make today   laughter  i think you and i should go in the corner of the room later and argu this out with each other
that   s all i have     anybodi els want to ask a question
if one think of the japanes author as specul  it   s general assum that if specul is stabil it   s profit   if it   s not profit  it   s destabil  do we know anyth about how much money the japanes have earn or lost on these intervent
in a recent paper  professor ito calcul that the japanes actual have made signific profit becaus of the carri   the interest rate spread between the cost of financ  which has been essenti zero in the last few year  and what they   ve earn on their treasuri   so there has been a signific profit   exchang rate have fluctuat  and the japanes have been buy at differ rate   but on the whole appar the intervent has been quit profit for them
is there ani regular pattern or expect pattern in japan as to what fraction of the intervent is  il
the way that the mof financ it intervent is that it issu financ bill  which in the first instanc are underwritten by the bank of japan   subsequ  some number of week later  the mof sell new financ bill to the market  and then it can refin and repay the bank of japan   so the one to one yen relationship that one would typic see when a central bank is interven  we realli don   t see becaus of the secondari rout  which then get unwound   now  when i spoke to peopl at the bank of japan about this issu  they didn   t see what the fuss was about   their view is that the mof is do it thing  we   re do our thing  and we don   t think of it in term of  il foreign exchang intervent   they   re look at it in term of target current account balanc   full stop
so essenti the mechan involv full  il of the exchang market intervent except for this period of a few week   the way you describ it  that   s how it sound to me
yes  but what i   m describ is the mechan involv and what the peopl at the bank of japan have said to me
i   m confid in say that this is not un il intervent   i think that   s as far as i want to go   whether it   s someth in between   a littl of this and a littl of that   i   m not so sure about that
could i move us from japan to the subject of page    where you gave an impress of some concern about what i   d call financi stabil   you comment about a lack of fear with regard to the dramat drop in corpor debt spread   i would say that what you were point out is certain factual and correct in the fix incom market   in the equiti market  howev  the risk premium seem to be quit consist with what it was befor the run up in the      s   we had a bit of discuss about that ye day with the staff here   so i do wonder if you   re right to talk about the lack of fear in fix incom market or if that is simpli a reflect of the fact that interest rate global are relat low   could it be that what we   re see is what one natur would expect to see in a low interest rate  low inflat environ
i think you make a good point that spread relationship in a low interest rate market might be somewhat differ from those in a high interest rate environ  again  i don   t want to overst what is depict here on page     i thought it was somewhat noteworthi that we were see some interest level that we hadn   t seen in a while   as for the equiti volatil  i would take your point that these kind of volatil number were not unusu in the earli     s   so i would agre with that   they are low  howev  compar with the late     s and earli     s   on the fix incom side  it   s not a question of fear but that in some quarter at least i think there   s a degre of discomfort with the level of the spread relationship  especi on emerg market debt
governor    may i just add an observ   it is a low inflat  low interest rate environ   it   s also one of an improv u s  economi
so for domest asset it may veri well be the case that investor are think that recoveri rate in the event of default may be better and the default risk itself may be lower   spread could be narrow independ of investor    avers to risk becaus their percept of the risk has gone down
good  thank you
if there are no further question  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the domest open market oper
i   ll move to ratifi the domest open market oper
without object   we turn now to dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman     and i will attempt to be brief this morn   we suspect that this may be an occas where we may have an easier  e explain our econom outlook to you than you will have figur out how to explain your econom outlook to other   as a consequ  we intend to yield back the balanc of our  e to   reinhart   in a nutshel  thing have been go veri well for the u s  economi in recent week   the data have been come in almost uniform stronger than we had expect six week ago   the latest piec of news fit that pattern was this morn   s releas of the septemb report on new order and shipment of nondefens capit good   new order outsid of aircraft were up near   percent last month  after have been about flat in august   shipment of nondefens capit good exclud aircraft were up     percent in septemb  more than revers the declin in august   the figur are a bit stronger than we had expect and would probabl lead us to add about   percentag point to the project growth of equip spend in both the third and the fourth quarter  bring the increas to    percent and    percent  respect   howev  the report also show manufactur    durabl inventori liquid even fa  than we expect   on balanc  the data that we have receiv sinc the close of the  book would leav unalt our es  of the increas in real gdp in the third quarter of    percent at an annual rate  a figur near   percentag point abov that in the septemb  book   all of that upward revis reflect stronger read on final sale  with notabl posit innov in consumpt  hous  govern outlay  and net export   no doubt  some of the burst in spend last quarter was simpli borrow from the futur   most notabl in that regard  we are interpret some of the unexplain strength in consumpt as reflect a more rapid respons than we had anticip to this summer   s reduct in person incom tax   as a consequ  we lower our project increas in real pce in the fourth quarter to offset some of the third quarter surpris   but in other area  the data appear to be signal greater under strength in demand   hous stand out as the most promin exampl   start  permit  and sale have all been phenomen of late   as a consequ  we mark up our forecast of residenti invest across the project period   ye day   s releas on sale of new and exist home for septemb certain support that decis   new home sale maintain their recent robust pace of about      million unit  and exist sale clock in at     million unit  establish yet anoth record for the seri   net area of payback against those of greater momentum  we revis down the project increas in real gdp in the fourth quarter by   percentag point to just under     percent   needless to say  that is onli a small offset to the sizabl third quarter surpris   this morn   s order figur suggest that we may be undo even that small downward revis   when coupl with some slight further upward revis to growth in      and        larg reflect the weaker exchang valu of the dollar in this forecast   these revis impli a level of real gdp about    percent abov that in the septemb  book throughout the project period   that said  i see the chang that we have made to this project as larg be one of degre   the basic forc that we had earlier expect to be at work in the economi now appear to be show through in the data   low interest rate and a surg of dispos incom generat by tax cut have provid a power s ulus to household spend  especi on durabl good and hous   moreov  low interest rate  togeth with a wane avers to risk  sharp gain in corpor profit  rise sale  and the partial expens tax provis appear to be creat a consider more hospit climat for busi invest   while the pattern has been choppi  outlay for defens have also been provid a sizabl boost to activ in recent month   perhap even more encourag  some of the area that gave us  and probabl mani of you  greatest paus about our forecast in mid septemb have shown some tentat sign of improv in recent week   industri product has firm a bit of late  with notabl strength in the product of high tech good  especi comput and semiconductor   the nation and region purchas manag    index suggest that further increas are in train this month   there are also sign of a nascent recoveri in labor market   privat payrol expand by        in septemb  and the juli and august figur were revis to show smaller declin  initi claim have been averag close to         this month  and insur unemploy has move lower   suggest that layoff may have abat some and that hire may be turn the corner   could the surpris strength of such a broad array of econom indic be signal the start of an even more vigor expans than we are project   the answer  of cours  is    yes      much of the strength in privat spend has been in interest sensit area such as auto  other consum durabl  hous  and capit equip   it is certain conceiv that we are underes  the potenc of zero real interest rate   the recent weaken of the dollar might be anoth indic that the current stanc of polici is deliv greater s ulus to activ than we have been project   anoth explan for the recent pickup in activ could be that busi caution is in the process of fade   as you know  we expect the unusu restraint on busi spend and hire to have larg dissip by the middl of next year   if busi sen ent were to improv more rapid than we are anticip  the accompani step up in the pace of hire  capit spend  and inventori invest could make the next few quarter look a lot more like a normal busi cycl recoveri than we current expect   i must admit that  in prepar this brief  i was struck by how often i was struggl to find synonym for strength   over the past three year  i had develop a reason complet list of substitut for weak   but lest you fear that we have fallen prey to the sin of convict concern our forecast of sustain expans  let me assur you that we remain capabl of conjur dark thought about the outlook  inde  there are still some veri palpabl downsid risk to our forecast   for one  neither we nor anyon els should have much confid in an abil to pars out the effect of this summer   s drop in person tax rate and the issuanc of rebat check on the  e profil of consum spend   our calcul reli more on judici assumpt than on hard empir evid  so the uncertainti surround these es  is larg   mayb the recent strength in consum spend has been main the consequ of the tax cut and  becaus we have experienc littl or no growth in labor incom  spend will short   out   some circumstanti evid could be seen as support this hypothesi   chain store sale   an admit poor predictor of broader consum spend   have drop back in recent week after pop up this summer  and the report that we hear from the automak are that sale have drop from spectacular to mere good in recent week   it is also possibl that some of the strength in busi spend will prove to be transitori   befor the war began in march  one of the explan for the so call soft patch was that  given the enorm uncertainti  busi were put capit spend project on hold   mayb the notic upturn in order sinc the spring is a temporari bulg that reflect the implement of those previous defer decis rather than an acceler in the under demand for capit equip  such a possibl might squar with the limit and guard guidanc that compani have provid for revenu and profit go forward  despit the spectacular gain mani have experienc recent   there are also ampl reason to discount the avail sign of improv in the labor market   we have seen similar period of fals hope over the past coupl of year   privat payrol improv a year ago  onli to fall back most of this year  moreov  both initi claim and insur unemploy drop to level compar to those we are current observ on three other occas dure the past three year   obvious  none of those occurr ul  prove a precursor to sustain expans   fals posit were not just a featur of the labor market data   the purchas manag    index show improv similar to that seen recent in earli       and industri product post a brief period of increas in the middl of that year  with investor appar price in substanti odd that a more vigor expans is under way  ani percept disappoint on that front could feed back negat through financi market onto the real economi  that would put at risk our forecast that output will grow rapid enough to make a dent in the current margin of underutil capac   we have taken some comfort from the greater synchron of the posit signal in the current episod relat to those earlier fals start   moreov  unlik       the pickup in activ to date has been driven by a strengthen of privat final demand  which are now increas more rapid than at ani  e sinc the late     s   still  we will need to see more evid befor we can confid confirm the sustain abov trend expans that we have been predict   in contrast to the mani surpris in the spend and product data  price develop have been unfold pretti much as we had expect   we continu to believ that the economi has the capac to grow rapid over the next two year without put upward pressur on inflat   slack in resourc util diminish onli slowli in our forecast  with the unemploy rate expect to declin to     percent by the end of      and to   percent by the end of        likewis  manufactur capac util rise from it current level of around    percent to onli    percent at the close of      and just abov    percent by the end of        in short  avail capac combin with continu strong gain in structur labor product should keep a lid on cost pressur   meanwhil  there have been few sign that inflat expect have deterior in ani materi manner  and given our benign outlook for price  we think the odd are low that expect will becom unglu over the next two year   howev  as we note in ye day   s board present  the confid band around our forecast for core inflat is quit wide  and the uncertainti surround that forecast has more to do with unaccount for shock than it   with our uncertainti about the strength or weak of the economi over the next two year   those result impli both that we will almost sure be wrong and that we probabl won   t be abl to offer you with ani confid good explan as to whi      son will now continu our present
as we report in the  book  the inform about econom activ abroad that we have receiv sinc the septemb fomc meet has confirm our view that foreign real gdp growth has rebound from the weak pace of the first half of the year   base on various indic from a varieti of countri plus the more robust es  for u s  third quarter growth than had been project in septemb  we have revis up our best guess of averag real growth abroad last quarter to     percent from the   percent we had project   the upward revis to the gdp growth figur for the third quarter is due in part to a recoveri in some previous strong countri that were weak earlier in the year for transitori reason   the primari explan for this outcom is the sar epidem  and the countri in question are china and other emerg market asian economi   but we have also revis up forecast for countri such as the unit kingdom  where the most recent evid suggest a stronger pace to real activ than we had expect   look ahead for      and       we see continu averag growth abroad at about the current pace as most like  similar to our septemb outlook although we have fiddl a bit with the project for individu countri   sustain growth at     percent would be a welcom improv in foreign econom perform  and it would go some way to close the relat growth differenti between the unit state and it trade partner   our baselin project call for that gap to narrow from over     percentag point this year to about    percentag point in        such an outcom would lessen the sens that the global economi is over depend on the engin of u s  growth  although i hasten to add that a surpris shortfal of u s  growth from that project in our baselin would have negat implic for growth abroad as well   among the foreign industri countri  we expect that canada and the unit kingdom will continu to record the most success perform   domest demand within those economi continu to be strong  and financi market as well as we are now expect the bank of england to begin rais it polici rate soon in respons   in our baselin forecast  growth in the euro area firm over the next year and achiev a pace of about     percent in        in contrast  we are a bit skeptic of the sign of recoveri in the japanes economi and have written down posit  but still low  real gdp growth go forward for that countri   all in all  the pictur for the industri countri is one in which the expans remain somewhat uneven but is share by all the major countri   for the develop countri  the project improv in growth over the forecast period is more dramat  as both the asian and latin american countri recov from various idiosyncrat problem this year to achiev signific more vigor growth next year   we anticip that china will continu to outperform all other countri with respect to report real gdp growth  although we expect the rate to moder a bit by        elsewher in asia  strength in the global high tech sector should provid support for rapid output growth of product that in turn will underpin incom and domest demand   in mexico  sustain expans of output depend upon a rebound in u s  manufactur that in turn s ul mexican manufactur   in general  we see dispers of real output growth lessen across the develop countri as global recoveri becom more firm establish in      and        our project that growth rate will return toward trend in most countri result in part from our sens of the normal work of macroeconom forc and in part from our natur reluct to project ani major new shock to the global economi  we do believ  howev  that we can detect in current data the basi for such an op ist outlook   one shock that might be of particular interest and relev is a more substanti declin in the valu of the dollar than we have incorpor into the baselin   such a develop might seem a possibl in light of the near   percent drop in the nomin valu of the dollar in term of the other major currenc that we have experienc dure the intermeet period   in addit  the continu widen of u s  trade and current account deficit  even as foreign growth recov  might heighten concern on the part of global investor about take on increas amount of exposur to u s  asset   accord  we includ in the  book an altern simul in which the real exchang valu of the dollar declin an addit    percent by the end of next year   this altern continu to assum that china and malaysia peg to the dollar but posit a one  e revalu in that peg so that these countri share in the adjust to a weaker dollar   foreign monetari author other than those peg are assum to implement polici accord to a taylor rule  so that they do take step to mitig the consequ of exchang rate appreci for their domest macroeconom perform   howev  with the exchang rate shock phase in and the usual lag in monetari polici effect  such polici respons cannot prevent signific effect on real gdp growth and inflat abroad   as report in the  book  the implic in the staff model of this larg and rapid declin in the dollar for u s  real gdp growth are plus   percentag point in      and     percentag point in        core pce inflat is increas about   percentag point   for foreign economi  our model predict the greatest declin in growth by year end      in canada becaus of it depend on export to the unit state  howev  in the near term  the largest negat impact fall on mexico and the develop countri of asia   these economi are also quit open and trade depend   in the simul  the largest reduct in inflat also occur in canada  mexico  and develop asia   in respons  the taylor rule call for veri larg reduct in short term interest rate by their respect offici   under our assumpt that the shock to exchang rate are compar across all of these trade partner  the negat consequ for growth in the euro area and the unit kingdom are relat mild and slow to develop   for japan  the option to eas rate in respons to further appreci is not avail and so the consequ for real growth are somewhat larger than in the euro area but less than in the other region  this particular simul suggest that signific and broad felt dollar depreci would have it greatest effect on output in two of the region of the global economi where perform is now strongest  canada and emerg asia  further into the futur  in respons to monetari s ulus  those economi should see domest demand offset the loss in extern demand   with j curv effect actual increas the nomin valu of u s  import follow declin in the dollar  our trade and current account balanc initi worsen and then subsequ begin to adjust   by the second half of       the u s  trade deficit would begin to narrow  that complet our prepar remark     and i will be happi to answer your question
i see you don   t have an es  for real adjust  durabl good for septemb yet   do you have a sens of the order of magnitud   the reason i rais the issu is that the extraordinari differ between total durabl good and real adjust durabl good for the month of august
we should be abl to have that calcul  i would imagin  by the coffe break or short after the break
i   ve found it to be a veri use statist over the year  and i   d like to get a sens of it   presid hoenig
look at       your es  for consumpt are strike strong   it would be great if the figur came out that way   but you es  consumpt to be as strong as it was in the late      s   you touch on your reason  but could you again give me your rational for that   i ask becaus your forecast is an outlier  it   s at the upper limit of the rang of forecast
there are realli three princip reason that we show as much strength as we do in consumpt for        the most import is that we   re expect a veri signific improv to occur in the labor market   as has been note a few  e around this tabl  our forecast is that job gain are go to be run         plus a month in        that is go to be creat a sizabl acceler in labor and   to the extent that there has been ani precautionari save motiv for the last two year   act to restrain consumpt less   second  we still get addit dispos incom from the enact tax cut so that more dispos incom is be deliv by fiscal polici as we move into        final  the wealth effect  which have been a signific drag on spend over the last two year  are turn from big negat to neutral   for us that is the princip reason we   re show a step up in real pce next year   on an annual averag basi we still have the save rate rise a bit  from    percent in      to    percent in        we see some reason risk around that forecast   but to the extent that you have doubt about ani of those three element in the forecast  i think you would have concern about our consumpt forecast as well
well  i question onli the third reason relat to the wealth effect  when we had these kind of growth rate in pce previous  the wealth effect were much more posit   so in my view the wealth effect return to neutral   while grant they are no longer a drag   won   t produc quit the boost that might be expect   i do agre with you on the labor market  howev  i certain see that improv as we move forward   but the consumpt forecast seem a littl strong to me
i had a question for     in compar the consensus forecast to the  book forecast  the blue chip forecast is much higher on inflat than you are and in fact than we are in chicago  the blue chip has a much higher expect path for the nomin fed fund rate  too   first of all  whi do you think it is that the blue chip forecast is higher on inflat than we are   second  you put two altern scenario into the  book   one with rise inflat expect and one with the market base fund path   when i look at these two scenario  intuit i want to add them togeth or look at them at the same  e   i was wonder if there was some interact here that i should be think of when i look at those two scenario
on your last point i think rough speak these scenario are addit   for most intent and purpos the model is reason linear  so i think you could probabl perform the analysi that way   as for your first question  i   ve been puzzl by the consensus inflat forecast as well  especi when our forecast is predic on energi price declin signific over next year   in line with current expect in the futur market for oil   so if the energi price assumpt in the consensus forecast are base on those futur price  that forecast must have a rather sharp acceler in under inflat   one possibl  of cours  is that the blue chip forecast put a great deal more emphasi on speed effect   or the chang in the unemploy rate   wherea we are still reli on the level of slack in both labor market and product market to be a restraint on overal inflat   we think the evid support that gap type effect   but as we discuss a littl over a year ago in the special present to the fomc  the phillip curv has gotten flat enough that we don   t deriv a great deal of traction in our inflat forecast from movement in the resourc and output gap  so i think one possibl is that there will be some deterior in inflat expect if we get as much growth as we   re project and polici remain unchang   that   s whi we includ that inflat expect scenario becaus it seem to us the most plausibl way  other than just through nois  that we could get signific higher core inflat next year   on the other side of that  though  we see downsid risk  with the level of the price markup over unit labor cost   and it mirror imag in the profit share   have recov quit strong   if these competit pressur were to oper to bring that back down closer to histor averag level  we see downsid risk associ with this forecast as well   so i think we   re comfort with our forecast   but as i note  those confid interv that we show at ye day   s board present suggest that nobodi should hold a view on that with strong convict
my question is relat to that of presid     at the end of the forecast period  when the output gap in the baselin is close to zero and inflat is close to   percent  a neutral nomin feder fund rate would be around     percent  which is about where financi market actual expect it to be   isn   t that a more reason baselin assumpt than that of the  book
i guess i   m forc to say    no       laughter   we still think that in essenc the equilibrium real fund rate is go to be below it histor averag by the end of        one reason is that the level of the dollar is still relat high despit the fact that it has come down   second  the invest share in gdp is still quit low relat to it histor averag   now  as we look further beyond the end of       we do think it would be reason to expect a return of the equilibrium real fund rate back to it histor averag of     percent or so  we think that   s the direct you   ll be head toward at that point   but we don   t see that process as occur so rapid that the market   s expect is the one that we want to buy into for the end of        that might be the case look down a coupl more year  but not in       in part there   s anoth factor that boost the equilibrium rate further down the road but that in the intermedi term is provid us with the capac for noninflationari growth  and that is that we   re expect a further acceler in potenti output growth some  beyond        as the improv in invest that we   re forecast occur  it lift potenti capit servic and provid a bit more space for the economi to grow   again  in the long run that obvious is a factor whi interest rate would need to be somewhat higher   but over the intermedi period it allow rate to be somewhat lower
it would seem to me that perhap one reason the financi market might have higher expect with regard to inflat is that they   re look at differ model  those model could have expect effect that would be quit pronounc if our exogen assumpt about interest rate were to be incorpor
that   s a risk that i think we tri to highlight here   obvious that is veri difficult for us to forecast   we don   t view that as the most like outcom in part becaus  with energi price declin rapid  headlin inflat actual is go to be quit low   i don   t think that   s a situat in which we   d anticip that inflat expect would like be build up much of a head of steam
presid  n
dave  i have a coupl of question relat to the labor market and other variabl   for quit some  e you   ve forecast a veri strong improv in employ begin relat earli next year and extend through        i assum at the end of the day that it must be intuit rather than a pure model base result   do you have ani anecdot or other inform that would give me greater confid than i have at the moment that someth like that result is like   of cours  it   s accompani by well below trend growth in structur product for that whole period
i think that is where the rubber meet the road   in fact  we are follow our model quit close here  but the under assumpt is that structur labor product is grow    percent   if we   re wrong and it is consider higher  then the first round effect would be that the economi will be abl to grow fa  with less employ go forward   if we   re not go to get that slowdown in product  we   re not go to get the boost to labor growth associ with that   that would mean on the other side of the incom statement that profit would be higher as well   we   d probabl figur that would net out to a slight weaker economi  given that the margin propens to consum out of labor incom is somewhat higher than that stem from capit incom   so  if we got a shift in an advers direct for labor next year  that would probabl tend to weaken our overal outlook  now  as you know  in the last forecast round we revis up further our es  of structur product   we didn   t do that this  e   we   re just week away from a comprehens revis to the nation incom account that is go to chang the last five year of histori   and mayb in signific way   our thought was  let   s wait to see what happen in the comprehens revis and then tri to put it all togeth  we got the hour revis this summer  and we   ll be get the output revis short
well  let me pursu this one step further   obvious  we can get this path of real gdp growth with almost ani combin of hour and product growth   if we got employ gain of  say          to         a month rather than         to         a month go forward and the differ was made up by product  to what extent would that mix give you a differ inflat forecast   i don   t know the interwork of your model that well  but i assum it would give you even lower inflat in a more or less base case environ than the scenario you present
it would inde   it would give that lower inflat through it effect on the aggreg amount of slack   there would be less employ and  therefor  a greater amount of slack in the labor market   if it were also a reflect of an under improv in structur labor product growth that was greater than we thought  that too would be reliev cost pressur even more than we are current es
it would give us deflat
as we show ye day  inflat is so slight abov our es  of measur bias there  it wouldn   t take much to do that   now  on the anecdot side  as i   ve indic  we   ve seen a few tentat sign that some improv may be under way   this is the first  e we   ve revis up our employ
well  i think some improv is under way   i question whether it   s go to reach the magnitud you have project in the  book
one chang we did make was to trim some of the strength we had in first quarter employ becaus we didn   t see enough in the forward look indic to provid us with confid on that   we trim some in q  and have stronger employ growth for the remaind of next year   it   s a forecast
i had the same question about the degre of differ between this forecast and one we see from major outsid forecast   at our bank we usual construct a littl chart that plot the  book forecast relat to other forecast   we have the respect forecast for real gdp on the x axi and the chang in the cpi or some other measur of inflat on the y axi   normal  the  book is somewher in the middl  but now it is clear an outlier for ani quarter one look at   it   s in the bottom right hand quadrant  with high gdp growth and veri low rate of inflat   if we do a similar comparison with respect to chang in the fed fund rate  we see veri big differ as well   that   s also true if one goe deeper into the forecast detail and look at what outsid think the gap is versus what the staff believ  even forecast that have a higher gap   through      anyway   still show rise rate of inflat and rise fed fund rate   so it seem that the construct you are use is realli differ from the vast major of other forecast   that could mean that you   re right   but it also put us in the unusu posit of be the op ist central bank
at least the op ist staff of the central bank    laughter   i leav it to you to decid how op ist you wish to be   you   re right   our forecast is an outlier   we realli struggl with that in the sens that if we were to be less op ist about the aggreg suppli side of our project  we would be show even greater employ growth than we alreadi are show   i think we   d have a hard  e explain how the level of product had gotten quit so high   we alreadi have it substanti abov our es  of structur product growth   our interpret of the strong employ gain that we   re show is that a lot of what we   ve seen has been cyclic   so we   re get pull in both these direct on the product side   the product and the employ data would tend to make us want to be more op ist   if we were more op ist  we   d be show even lower inflat than we   re show  and that would push us further away from the consensus in that direct
the other question i want to rais relat to a statement by one contact   one of what seem like a zillion i   ve talk with over the last four or five week   who liken the uptick in consumpt over the summer to a sugar high associ with the greater fiscal s ulus   we   re a littl more downbeat in new england than near everybodi els  as everyon could see from the beig book  and mayb that   s just a reflect of our environ  i don   t know   you did mention  howev  a few thing that seem to be come in a bit on the weaker side in septemb and earli octob   i must say that  in talk with the peopl from first call  while the profit number have been exceed analyst    expect  there seem to be a number of warn that it is not go to continu and some concern express about that  mayb you could elabor on this  though you talk about it a littl in your present
i think that   s clear a downsid risk   again  our forecast is predic on the notion that the spend pattern this summer wasn   t fulli a sugar high relat to the fiscal s ulus   we believ that the overal environ for consum spend   with some improv in balanc sheet  some step up in sen ent sinc the spring  and low interest rate   is provid support to consumpt   we couldn   t see attribut all of the higher spend just to the tax effect   but to the extent that one might be look at the high frequenc indic  i think the recent read would give one at least a littl concern about our forecast that consumpt will remain as strong as we have project   now  our pce forecast drop off to less than   percent in the fourth quarter  so we have assum that there   s go to be some payback   part of it relat to motor vehicl   for a lot of the strength that we saw earlier   here again we were balanc the possibl that the data may be signal greater under momentum than we are allow for versus the possibl that more of this has just been a temporari pull forward of purchas   whether we got that balanc right or not  i don   t know  as i indic  tri to pin down the tax effect is most guesswork   we realli don   t have veri much in the way of hard empir evid to base those calcul on   so to me that say that the uncertainti about consumpt for the next few month is especi larg   the confid interv is alway wide  but i think in this period it   s even wider than usual becaus we have to contend with tri to interpret someth about which there is a great deal of uncertainti
dave  on the monetari aggreg   both m  and mzm show no net growth over the last three month  and bank credit has actual declin a bit   is there a stori or anyth interest behind those observ
i   ll let   speak to the monetari aggreg  but in term of short term borrow  busi did a whole lot of borrow in the second quarter in the environ of veri low interest rate   they built up their liquid asset and solidifi their balanc sheet quit signific   corpor cash flow and intern fund have been go gangbust recent  and it is still the case with respect to demand for short term credit   for exampl  inventori invest   that firm are continu to liquid inventori   so we put those thing togeth and we   re not read from the recent drop off in busi borrow a signal of impend weak   i don   t know     if you have ani word you want to say about this
with regard to c i loan  i would note that in the latest senior loan offic opinion survey  bank report that demand had been weak over the last three month  that is consist with declin inventori  although the answer to more forward look question provid a littl glimmer of hope in that regard   as for the monetari aggreg  we believ that the slowdown in mortgag refinanc has pull down liquid deposit to a consider degre   we suspect that it actual pull down m  growth in particular   more so than we   d previous been allow for use our rule of thumb   and we were work in that direct   depend on the assumpt one make with regard to  e   in term of how long the deposit sit there   much of the slowdown could be account for by refinanc effect
i  too  was struggl with the staff   s inflat forecast and had notic what cathi   talk about in connect with the  book relat to other forecast   it start me think about what i   ll call the integr of our forecast process in a chang environ   we know our model has long adjust and distribut lag to polici  and we   re es  the relev variabl over a period of  e when we haven   t had as s ul a monetari polici as we have now   i wonder whether or not other are adjust their forecast to react to that and whether our inabl  or our unwilling  to do so is lead us to a result that look the way it    as we   ve discuss at this tabl   in essenc  i   m a littl concern that this may involv a regim chang in the luca sens and each of the forecast model is tri to play with how to adjust to the data in their forecast   can you give me ani comfort that these long lag are appropri adjust
may i just add to that   you emphas befor that we   re deal with a linear model   how mani observ do we have that indic that  as the inflat rate move down  the margin chang in the gap are inde linear   or are we possibl look at a situat in which the model work fine with an inflat rate over   percent and  inde  is linear up to    percent or someth like that but the number of observ we have below   percent is realli quit small   i was curious whether or not you have ani sens as to whether we   re deal with a differ regim in the same sens as when a particl approach the speed of light it characterist chang   now  i scarc want to draw that as an analog to your model  but there are such regim  and basic i suspect that a problem like that may be involv here
i suggest that compar the board   s bureaucraci to someth that would move at the speed of light is push that analog    laughter   first  i think you   re obvious right   ani  e you   re use a model es  with histor data to forecast a futur period with event that are toward or outsid the limit of what you   ve es  your model on  you have to believ that there   s go to be some wider confid interv around that forecast   we have never been abl to find  and we have look for it  evid of nonlinear in the gap term or of what peopl use to call    goal line effect      evid that the influenc of the gap might becom smaller the closer we get to price stabil   the data don   t seem to support that veri strong  the question that presid santomero has rais is certain one that we have been concern about becaus of the possibl that our model may not be abl to pick up that kind of regim shift   i think the altern simul that we did   where we let inflat expect in a sens becom unglu from what our model would expect     tri to highlight for you what we think the potenti consequ of that risk would be   as i indic  there are a coupl of reason whi we don   t view that as the best baselin expect   one is that we think headlin inflat is go to be quit well behav when energi price start to come down  that   s certain go to help   it   s also the case that  if we   re right at least in the first half of next year  let   s say  market are go to be abl to see that  even though there   s not go to be a chang in monetari polici  you   re also not throw in the towel on contain inflat   actual inflat will be come in quit low  if our forecast is correct  so your behavior in fact will be consist with expect about your object   to a larg degre that is the way we would provid some rational for our baselin assumpt   obvious  if we get rapid growth and a string of unattract inflat number  the risk would start to rise that peopl would wonder whether or not you were give in on your inflat object   we see that as a potenti risk if market observ are look at   percent gdp growth and employ is pick up and you don   t do anyth for a consider period of  e on the monetari polici front   on the other hand  they will be see core inflat figur  if we   re right  that look veri good and headlin inflat figur that look extrem good   so they   re not necessarili go to see a compel requir for you to have to adjust polici   they might  in fact  be quit comfort with that outcom
do you think that the revis in the nipa data could signific alter our view about some of the key relationship we   re now take as be fit with some robust   the bea  sn   t have new data on the most recent period    it
well  i have a hard  e imagin that the nipa revis are go to alter the output and inflat nexus fundament   the unemploy rate is not go to be affect at all by this  of cours   the price figur  although they get revis  tend not to be revis dramat or persist enough for the relationship in our inflat equat to chang   one area in which we could see chang big enough to affect under paramet in the model might be invest spend   for exampl  if there   s a signific revis in softwar invest   we saw one the last  e there was a nipa revis   that could influenc our think about what is happen with the long run share of softwar invest relat to overal output  that in turn could affect our potenti gdp forecast and our view of what invest spend is like to be over the next few quarter   similar  if we get big revis on the incom side  that could alter the save rate enough perhap to chang our view about the sensit of consum spend and save to wealth
isn   t the latter the most like problem becaus that figur is a residu and often has been revis far more substanti than the other element of the system
we   ve had veri big revis on the incom side  some of them flow through quit often into the save rate   so i think that is a real possibl

thank you  mr  chairman   recent econom growth in the twelfth district appear to have kept up with the nation pace   in fact  nevada and hawaii have grown quit rapid with a boost from strong tourist trade   arizona also has had relat strong growth  though our contact tell us that this come in part at the expens of california  throughout the district our contact have note more case of employe work longer hour and of plan to add posit in come month   howev  it is also clear that firm are continu effort to increas effici   manufactur in the district are report increas in order   the demand for build materi in the northwest has been grow   on the technolog front  most it produc are report improv busi condit   it is also encourag that r d spend by it and biotech firm general has held up relat well in the downturn  with busi condit firm  offic vacanc rate edg down recent in san francisco and seattl  two area that have been hit hard   the hous market in the district remain strong  especi in the phoenix area   in california much attent is on how the governor elect  arnold schwarzenegg  will deal with the state   s fiscal situat   for exampl  the budget agreement work out last august left the state with a structur budget shortfal of about    billion for futur fiscal year   even more press  though  are the crack form in the state   s budget agreement for the current fiscal year   in septemb the court disallow the sale of    billion in pension bond the state plan to use to make payment to it retir fund   more recent  a suit was file challeng the legal of a propos bond sale of       billion to pay off the short term debt support current spend   also thrown into the equat is the governor elect   s vow to reduc the car registr tax by    billion   which  of cours  would be a direct hit to state revenu   one plan put forth by the schwarzenegg team to meet fund need is to issu about     billion in long term general oblig bond   this was not well receiv in sacramento or by the rate agenc   the realiti  though  is that without new debt of some kind the state will be in a cash flow crisi come next june  onc again we   ve been pleasant surpris by the recent data on the nation economi  as a result  we  too  have rais our es  of how fast the economi is like to grow in the near term   we now expect real gdp to grow at a pace close to   percent in the second half of this year and in       which is realli not that differ from the  book forecast   howev  we have a less accommod path for monetari polici that is much closer to market expect   output is expect to grow notic fa  than it potenti rate next year and to continu to grow somewhat abov potenti the year after that  but the economi   not reach full employ until the second half of        so inflat is expect to remain around current low level   although these low level of inflat impli that disinflationari shock could still impos substanti cost upon the economi  recent data suggest that the risk are not as larg as befor   in fact  recent develop such as the lower dollar have caus us to rais our inflat forecast slight   to me this suggest that it may be  e to consid modifi the risk assess statement to indic that the risk to the inflat outlook are at least close to be balanc
first vice presid stewart
by most measur the second district economi appear to be on the rebound in absolut term and particular relat to the nation as whole   privat sector employ has trend up in new jersey but has held near it cyclic low in new york   our empir state manufactur survey  which had been signal steadi growth in the second and third quarter  kick into a higher gear in octob  suggest acceler activ and even some pickup in employ   this is consist with a recent upturn in job in hard hit manufactur area of upstat new york such as rochest   hous market in and around new york citi sustain strong forward momentum in the third quarter  with brisk sale activ  a diminish inventori of home for sale  and continu price appreci   new construct has also remain robust   reflect a combin of general econom improv and recent increas in tax rate  new york state  new york citi  and new jersey all report a continu pickup in tax revenu in the third quarter  on the nation side  the upsurg in recent activ is clear welcom   product appear to be ramp up to catch up to household spend  and there are sign that capit spend is come back to life   busi confid is firm  with the pickup in growth and the pronounc turnaround in profit   the labor market look a bit better   i don   t think much should be made of the small increas in job last month   the figur for septemb was a littl abov zero after a string of number slight below zero   still  it was good to see  and there are indic of some follow through   unemploy claim have fallen a bit  busi survey are show stronger hire plan  and we are hear about firm activ seek worker  look ahead  i believ that the recoveri will be subdu and that inflat will remain under control for a consider period   busi will continu to meet increas demand with an improv manag model  which will limit the need for signific more plant  inventori  or employe   capac will continu to grow rapid in china and india  which will limit price power for u s  produc   busi peopl are concern about the long term implic of our larg fiscal deficit and the current account deficit   there   s a general belief that we are live beyond our mean in this countri and that the price will be paid after the current s ul boom run it cours   one facet of this concern is our global competit   we have been abl to move into higher valu activ in the past when manufactur job move offshor   but today we see that some develop countri have larg pool of well educ and inexpens worker that are begin to challeng our posit in area such as technolog  my assumpt is that the relationship between econom recoveri and busi decisionmak is quit differ now than it was histor   we first saw the chang in the      recoveri  when employ gain were veri late and moder   i believ that in this recoveri we will see busi do veri well in term of sale  profit  and cash flow but that it will not translat into the same level of hire and plant expans that we expect in the past  instead it will show up in larger dividend and continu pressur for more product from exist peopl and equip   ani new capac expans will be done offshor when possibl   given this outlook  i believ that monetari polici will be stabl for quit some  e  and in my view our statement should continu to communic that messag   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   you may have seen sever week ago a wall street journal articl on the transport industri   given that sever major transport compani are locat in the eighth district  i thought i would comment on that industri   my fedex contact said that he was not as bullish about the outlook as the view convey in the wall street journal articl   he said  in particular  that the higher valu busi   the more expens good that are often ship by air     not seem to be come back though the lower valu ground busi is rebound more quick   he provid some data on the ground busi that show fair strike increas in growth   in the middl of this year  the ground busi at fedex was about   percent abov year ago level  and it   s now run in the neighborhood of   to   percent ahead of last year   s figur   moreov  my contact indic that fedex is expect in the first half of      year over year increas in the    percent rang   he say he is much more confid about growth than he has been for some  e   it   s not that the expect growth is all that high but that it seem a good bit more certain that a solid recoveri is under way   he expect the growth in express busi   air shipment onli   to increas from the current   to   percent on a year over year basi to about   to   percent by next spring   so he anticip a pickup in that segment of the busi as well  fedex had a five year expans plan to doubl it ground capac   up  of cours  is the major compani in that busi  but fedex has been catch up in recent year   fedex offici had been discuss defer some of that capac increas but have now decid to proceed with their aggress expans plan   busi is continu to shift from express to ground   that   s a consequ of the push toward lower cost shipment but also reflect the fact that the speed of ground deliveri has improv   that is  the featur of the ground network have been improv  and packag can be deliv more quick than befor   so in term of speed  it   s more competit with the deliveri schedul that have been avail in air shipment for a long  e   the weakest part of the busi is in outbound express from the unit state  fedex continu to have a big imbal of shipment  with much more volum come in than go out  the firm see the intern situat as quit strong  especi in asia includ japan   in fact  the situat in japan is look much better   busi is lag in latin america  howev  and is hurt in europ primarili becaus of slow growth in germani   as for the labor situat  fed ex has veri low   in fact record low   turnov in it employ forc  particular among lower skill worker  such as packag handler   the compani see no wage pressur in either the lower skill or the more skill level of it staff   in the latter categori  for exampl  a lot of pilot are avail  my up contact said that  for the first  e in well over two year  they are see strong growth as they go into the fourth quarter  which of cours is the big holiday season   growth that will exceed the expect they had earlier in the year   he anticip that the fourth quarter will be veri  veri strong   up report that comput compani are increas their shipment and that ship for the mail order busi is strong   my contact point out  howev  that the up number are somewhat affect by the fact that shipper sign a lot of contract in      right after a strike  so as those contract now roll over  up is pick up some of that busi again   the compani   s number look a littl stronger as a consequ   the cargo industri in general is veri busi  part becaus of militari lift to iraq  but my contact indic that the militari busi is not the whole stori at all  let me turn to the truck industri   my contact at j b  hunt said that from his perspect the wall street journal articl substanti overst the strength in the transport industri   my hunt contact has not seen a major turnaround in ani area of hunt   s busi   the freight busi is a littl stronger than last year  regist an increas of about     percent in volum   their intermod busi   the piggyback or rail   truck combin   is much stronger now on a year over year basi  but that reflect the fact that the west coast port were shut down a year ago   moreov  base on what he know about the situat among competitor  he see no indic of a surg anywher in the truck industri   some stori of tight in that market might be come along  howev  as a consequ of the reduct in capac   a lot of truck compani have gone under  and driver continu to be in tight suppli   he note also that  on januari    new rule for driver go into effect that increas the requir rest period or reduc the maximum number of hour of drive   he saw one calcul that these chang will requir        new driver nation   appar there aren   t that mani driver around readi to be pick up   so if that number is correct  we might see at least some temporari disrupt until some of us decid to seek a more lucrat occup   laughter   the old rule that are be chang  by the way  have been in place sinc       i might share an observ from a member of our board about a compani name kimbal intern   what i rememb about kimbal is that it use to make piano  but appar it now manufactur high end offic furnitur   he said that kimbal has experienc a surg in order for offic furnitur in just the past four week   order were    pick up at a rapid pace    is the way he put it   i thought that was an interest piec of inform  i recent talk with my wal mart contact   at the end ye day afternoon actual   and he said that septemb sale had been a littl stronger than expect   wal mart had been anticip a year over year increas in same store sale of   to   percent  and it came in at     percent   he point out  though  that the weather had been unusu good in septemb   he said that retail often use weather as an excus to explain low sale  but he was cite weather as the reason that wal mart had a better perform than had been anticip   septemb came in somewhat below august  howev  but as i think i mention last  e  august sale had been signific stronger than anticip becaus of the larg volum of clearanc good  for octob  wal mart had been expect an increas of   to   percent in same store sale  and to date   as of ye day afternoon   sale for the month were up about     percent  he note that two third of the sale gain is come from increas traffic rather than the averag size of the sale ticket   my contact view that as just an indic that wal mart is take custom from it competitor   he continu to see evid of signific liquid pressur in the household sector   for exampl  a predomin of item in the shop basket continu to be concentr at the open price point of various product line   moreov  the midmonth paycheck cycl that i   ve talk about befor is still evid and in fact is more pronounc than at ani  e in the last three to five year   peopl are shop when they get their paycheck  and that   s true even for purchas of food and pharmaceut   so wal mart interpret it data as an indic that household remain liquid constrain  my contact believ that there has been some improv but that it is    stall    at an increas in growth of about    to    basi point   he   not see sale growth get better and better week by week   there had been a pickup around the middl of the year or some  in august  but he see no ongo sign of higher growth   he said that inventori are general in pretti good shape   some item are a bit understock and some a bit overstock  apparel particular was a littl on the high side   but inventori overal for wal mart are close to desir level   as for the outlook  compar with some other firm whose view he was awar of  he thought wal mart was among the most op ist and had the most solid commit to continu capit expans   at a lot of other compani that he was familiar with  plan were on hold and there were no anticip increas in capac at all   the onli capit spend occur or in prospect was direct toward product improv and not capac expans   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in new england have neither deterior nor improv veri much sinc our last meet  at least as far as we can tell  the intermeet interv has been a rather busi period of region outreach for us   in addit to the beig book survey  we   ve had meet of our academ and small busi council  we   ve also had sever banker    forum  a gather of local softwar execut  and a wide rang of convers with busi leader   there are clear some posit note in the report from these contact  chipmak and storag equip manufactur are increas product and even are hire   our up contact for the new england area see an uptrend in the firm   s domest busi   but on balanc the overal tone is a bit flat or even downbeat from where it was in the summer   busi are work hard to maintain margin and are look forward to spend more and to hire local as well as outsourc   but the point at which a major will feel comfort do so  sn   t seem to be here yet  region employ level declin in septemb  with a decreas compar with a year ago of around   percent  and that   s a good deal more than the small      percent  declin for the nation as a whole   manufactur has about    percent of overal job  but that sector repres about    percent of the job loss over the past twelv month  with the remaind primarili in the construct and the inform technolog industri  as most of you have seen  our beig book contact in manufactur seem a bit out of step with other in the nation in report flat or deterior demand   that was due in part to the fact that a few of our contact were unavail or much less communic than usual given the proxim of q  earn report   had the full group been reflect in our report  it like would have note flat or slight rise demand and revenu but would have sound a similar note of caution   compani in the life scienc area have seen good growth in the third quarter  and defens depart spend has proven benefici to some other firm   but the region   s largest manufactur and a rang of smaller industri do not expect much of a boost from the economi in come quarter   most have cut employ  plan to continu do so  and are current outsourc product to foreign countri  those expect improv in their busi are depend on product innov  increas market share by acquisit  and a continu keen focus on cost control  the region   s small and medium size bank remain in good shape financi  with good asset qualiti  strong capit ratio  and veri littl in the way of delinqu or chargeoff  their major complaint involv a drop in refinanc busi and veri tight margin  residenti real estat market remain strong in the region  with robust demand  somewhat slower sale growth  and steadi home construct   depend on the bank and the area  small busi borrow is report to be either flat or slowli improv  though mani banker note that the improv they see main involv firm leav larger compani or some  newli merg institut   in those case  the size of the larger institut has made it less will to meet the demand of smaller busi  softwar firm report some sign of growth  though there   s a lot of variat in how compani are do depend on their area of special   some   for exampl  those involv in portal applic  which enabl easi use of data storag and multipl legaci system   report record growth   other involv in area that were overbought in the      s continu to see problem in term of their revenu  though the latter are perhap at a point of bottom out   tech firm report that access to capit market is vari as well   money is avail in equiti market and from ventur capitalist  but revenu prospect and stabil have to be veri solid   cost control is seen as a critic element for these compani  and they find advantag in use oversea labor  particular in india  china  and russia   report the outsourc softwar work tend to be the more routin task  with higher level job remain in new england  final  commerci real estat market could be stabil a bit   cb   elli report an increas number of tenant look for space in the market   inde  we at the bank have seen an increas in the number of call about and walk through of our avail space  howev  most of these prospect tenant have a number of properti to choos from   inde  regionwid the avail of offic space increas a bit from the second to the third quarter  and per squar foot ask price declin slight   but overal the pictur look a littl better than it did  in sum  the recoveri in the region seem to be muddl along   thing look brighter earlier in the third quarter and a bit less so as septemb wore on   employ is a real concern in the region   consum confid about the present situat has soften  and busi confid has stay bare posit   hope for stronger growth remain  but there is a sens of under concern that real improv is take too long to materi  turn to the nation  clear the incom data on the third quarter have been stronger than expect   consum and busi spend has acceler  driven in larg part by the addit to dispos person incom from tax cut and child tax credit and the avail of partial tax expens for equip   profit margin overal appear to have held up well  at least in part becaus of favor currenc translat   busi spend on equip and softwar began to acceler  too  and like will continu to grow  though at what pace it   s hard to determin   profit growth ought to lead to hire as well  but that hasn   t happen much yet  and labor market remain soft   financi market have strengthen  and credit spread have becom more accommod   inventori have been drawn down  augur well for some impetus to q  growth  and the declin dollar  assum that the declin continu to be order  augur favor for some net export support in the current quarter as well   moreov  the outlook isn   t quit as gloomi on the extern side  particular in non japan asia  the unit kingdom  and canada   but the question remain as to whether the growth we are see is self sustain   the answer to that has to center on whether or not we will see job creation suffici to begin to close the output gap  we talk a lot befor  and i won   t go into it further  about the op ist outlook in the  book for gdp  unemploy  and inflat   at least relat to other forecast  presid  n mention the job growth figur   the  book is project an increas of   million job over      and        in a typic recoveri that amount of job growth would occur over a four year period rather than in two year   normal we see a jump in job growth as the recoveri begin  we haven   t seen that this  e   but in the  book forecast  the job growth project for      and      will make up the shortfal we   ve had in this jobless recoveri and take about half the  e   that   s a lot of job in a short period of  e   we in boston don   t see the same pace of gdp growth in      that the board staff project   our es  is in the upper  s  with a small downtick in unemploy and a flat price trend   there are upsid risk   other have mention them   especi if we turn out to be more op ist about the under inflat process than is warrant   in a way  see risk on both side of the  book forecast give me a bit of reassur  though i believ that the potenti downsid develop  if realiz  would be a bit more cost and problemat   at least in term of the initi effect   than those on the upsid   for now i would advoc no chang in our polici posit  and i would hope as littl chang as possibl in what we say about it   but i   ll say more about communic later when  i assum  we will take up that subject separ

mr  chairman  the tenth district economi continu to improv  and our busi contact have becom somewhat more op ist about the outlook   let me talk a littl about the labor market  they remain soft but are show some sign of firm   accord to some of the payrol data we   ve look at  employ was flat for our district in septemb  howev  layoff announc are down from earlier in the year  and more firm say that they are plan to hire or are think about hire   i would note anecdot that firm announc job increas in the last coupl of month includ sever call center  a major railroad  sever manufactur in our area  and a number of high tech firm in colorado   to the relief of peopl in both kansa citi and tulsa  american airlin decid not to lay off worker at it two larg mainten facil in those citi  on the manufactur side  activ actual strengthen further   product and new order both increas  and expect for futur product and order remain relat high   capit spend also improv somewhat   although employ remain below year ago level  the averag workweek did rise notic   on the negat side  aircraft manufactur continu to struggl  with littl improv expect until        i would note that from august to septemb the year over year product index from our survey of manufactur rose from   to     the new order index climb from    to     and the capit spend index improv from   to      moreov  preliminari data receiv for octob as late as ye day suggest that these trend persist in octob  consum spend continu to edg up despit the softer labor market that i mention   retail contact also said that they had had pretti good sale and their confid remain strong   hous activ increas further  set new record in most of the area except for denver where it   s a littl slower   commerci real estat   remain weak in the region  and energi activ is expand but at a moder pace   state and local budget show further sign of improv  with some tax revenu increas in sever of our state   but i would caution that to some extent those number reflect tax increas   on the agricultur side  forecast for net incom have move up as much as    percent over last year   but i would remind you that about     billion of feder farm payment are includ in those number  let me turn to the nation outlook   the econom forc are in place for a relat robust recoveri   that assess is base on current monetari polici  fiscal polici  product  and a good strong financi system that can support credit need go forward  overal  i expect growth through the end of next year to be abov   percent  a littl better than the blue chip consensus but not quit as strong as the  book forecast   as note  a recoveri in capit spend and an increas in employ remain two risk to our achiev sustain econom growth   but i   m hear about some increas in capit spend from the peopl we talk to  and we see some evid of it in the number   in my convers with ceo in the district  there   s a clear sens of greater confid and an indic that firm are more will to undertak plan expans   so i   m op ist about that   we also are begin to see some sign that labor market are respond to the acceler in growth over the past sever month   the evid is veri preliminari and tentat  i realiz  but i think it bode well for the labor market go forward  turn to the inflat outlook  i would say that  in the near term  inflat is like to remain stabl and that the risk go forward are about balanc   a continu declin in the dollar could put upward pressur on inflat   although the output gap may put some downward pressur on inflat  i am reluct to put a lot of weight on that gap as a predictor of inflat  research here and elsewher suggest that the predict power of the output gap on inflat are difficult to find  final  on the topic of polici let me say that i clear would be of the view that for now we should maintain polici where it is   i think ani chang would actual be harm in the current environ   howev  given recent data  i   m not convinc that we can defin a period within which we can keep rate this low   i also think it   s import that the public come to realiz  as presid parri suggest  that an accommod polici refer to the level of the fund rate and not to the direct of ani chang   although i do not have a point es  of the long run equilibrium for the fund rate  it probabl is more like in a rang of   to   percent than near   percent   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman  i would describ the inform that we   ve receiv on our district   s economi recent as general mix   of cours  a hurrican hit us short after our last meet  the storm uproot a lot of tree  caus extens power outag  and forc some busi close for a while  but i don   t think it has had ani signific longer term effect on the region economi   again  the overal inform we   ve receiv is mix   i would say that mani servic industri seem to be do reason well at this point but manufactur activ  which appear to be improv a littl dure the summer month  has soften most recent accord to our latest month survey   both shipment and new order have been declin at a number of facil  and addit layoff have been announc at sever textil and apparel plant  i   d like to focus for a minut or two on the anecdot inform we   ve receiv as oppos to the recent data   we   ve talk with a number of peopl in recent week  and i would say that on balanc they   re probabl a littl more op ist than they were at the  e of the last meet but not much   most of our busi contact are still more than normal uncertain about the outlook  and henc they   re still hesit to commit to signific new invest or workforc expans   we had a joint meet of all three of our board   the bal or and charlott board as well as the richmond board   here in d c  a coupl of week ago   i thought the tone of the econom discuss at that meet was remark restrain  given all the media hype about the possibl that the expans is begin to acceler   if those board member could see the  book project  they probabl all would be surpris   some of them would be encourag but i think a few at least would think we   ve been smoke someth
i just want the record to show that that is not the case    laughter
i withdraw that statement   turn to the nation economi  the lead stori in this  book  of cours  is the   percentag point upward revis  to    percent  in the third quarter growth rate   given es  potenti gdp  there   s a chanc  as we all know  that the output gap has shrunk from around   percent in the second quarter to below   percent in the third quarter   in the staff project  the gap has been mark down to about    percent at the end of next year   incident  i think it   s veri help to have that number in the  book explicit  and i appreci your put it there   in ani case  it   s obvious a veri encourag project  as we   ve note alreadi in our discuss  but it   s import to note that  in the third quarter  firm met the step up demand with continu high product growth and actual slight lower aggreg hour work than in the second quarter   so in that sens the job market weaken further in the third quarter  and what one might call the employ gap actual widen further sinc aggreg hour need to grow at an annual rate of around   percent to absorb the normal increas in the labor forc   so there   s a tension or diverg  whatev the right word is  between a narrow output gap and a widen employ gap in the third quarter that   s go to have to be resolv one way or anoth  i   m realli look at what we   ve been talk about in just a littl differ way   the  book resolv the diverg by assum that the recent except high product growth reflect the extraordinari reluct of firm to hire and rehir worker   the  book project assum that this factor start to abat next year with product growth slow dramat as firm begin to hire veri aggress to meet rise demand   demand grow fast enough in the forecast to reduc the excess suppli of labor by the end of next year  but there   s an altern resolut that   s worth consid  and i guess this is one of those dark thought that you mention in your brief      if product continu to grow as rapid as demand next year   either becaus product grow more rapid than expect or becaus demand grow more slowli than expect   the consequ in this altern scenario is that the job market remain weak   the weak job market  in turn  give rise to a bigger declin in unit labor cost than project in the  book   as a result  becaus firm tend to pass persist fall unit labor cost through to price  there   s more disinfl in this altern scenario than in the  book baselin   so we wind up with a slower narrow of both the output gap and what i call the employ gap as well as more disinfl   also  monetari polici might have to be a part of the resolut of such a scenario   conceiv  we might have to lower the nomin fund rate go forward either to keep the real rate from rise or to reduc the real rate in order to s ul the economi  so in sum  i like the  book forecast   it   s veri easi to love  and i don   t think it   s implaus   but we need to keep in mind  at least for the  e be  the less favor altern scenario that i   ve describ and that other have describ in differ way here today  as we think about polici  the statement  the word of the announc  and all the rest  the risk with respect to price stabil as i see it are still decid on the downsid  and i think we need to indic that clear in our decis and our announc today
thank you  mr  chairman   most sign of econom recoveri in the third district have strengthen over the intermeet period  unlik some of the report we   ve heard from my neighbor district   the except is the labor market indic  which have not shown ani improv   the job market in our region has fare better than in the nation as a whole   stronger job growth in educ and health servic and in the leisur and hospit industri in our district   s state compar with the growth in these sector in the rest of the nation contribut to the region   s better job perform   that said  district labor market still are character as weak   pennsylvania and delawar payrol remain below their level at the end of the recess   onli new jersey has seen job growth  as first vice presid stewart indic in his coverag of the northern jersey employ number  we have receiv better news from the manufactur and retail sector   we have solid evid of a recoveri in manufactur  although structur chang has continu to limit the strength in that sector   sever indic in our busi outlook survey show strong improv this month   the index of general activ advanc sharpli to plus    percent  it highest read sinc      and the fifth consecut posit read   the index of new order and shipment also advanc and are at their highest level sinc mid        even the employ index turn slight posit this month   howev  most firm survey are not back to their pre recess level of product   near three quarter said they experienc product declin dure the recess  and less than one fifth of these firm expect to be back to pre recess level in the first quarter of        more than one third said they expect not to return to those level in the forese futur  which by that survey question meant the end of        most respond cite as reason long term declin in their industri and loss of market share to competitor both here and abroad   these number might help us to quantifi the degre to which the current weak in manufactur is due to structur as oppos to cyclic factor  retail sale in our region continu to improv modest   septemb sale were up from august even though some eas in the rate of sale increas was expect becaus of incom tax rebat and a good back to school season that boost august sale   our retail have revis upward their fourth quarter sale forecast   respond to our south jersey busi survey     percent of whom are in nonmanufactur area  report an increas in equip spend in the third quarter and plan for even stronger spend six month from now   and residenti invest in the district remain high despit increas mortgag interest rate   so  overal the recoveri continu to build momentum in the third district  and busi contact in our region  includ those on our board of director  are express more op  than i   ve heard for a while  econom condit in the nation have improv sinc our last meet as well   growth in the third quarter was veri strong  but firm rais product and thus continu to shed worker   i agre with the  book that demand will continu to grow at a solid pace in the current quarter  although somewhat slower than last quarter  and that we   ll final begin to see payrol job growth   condit are support of continu strengthen next year   equip and softwar spend is expand at a good pace   the stronger data for order and shipment coupl with robust growth in corpor profit should help boost busi invest go forward   i would welcom a period of strong growth sinc a signific amount of econom slack in labor and product market still remain  as other have indic  and core inflat continu to be subdu   nonetheless  i believ that the risk of pernici disinfl has subsid somewhat  i agre with the  book that inflationari forc are like to be mute over the near term   but i believ that we will have to begin to take some of the monetari accommod back to help ensur that we don   t get ani inflat   and probabl earlier than mid      as the  book assum   accord  given the strengthen of the under economi and the forecast of continu improv over the next sever quarter  i think we should begin to shorten the expect  e frame of ongo accommod   but this bring me quit close to the next topic  which is our communic polici   so i   ll end my comment here befor i go too far into that agenda item   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the      recess is now near two year behind us  and i believ that most peopl in the fourth district have accept  perhap surpris  that the economi is expand   even our manufactur are see evid of improv in busi activ   our steel produc report that the worst may be over and that price are actual firm in some market   machin tool maker report that they also are see a pickup in order from small and medium size busi as a result of the special depreci allow for capit good  nevertheless  there is still a great deal of anxieti about the sustain of the recent upturn in busi activ   i   m told by my busi contact that the expans lack balanc  banker  for exampl  are have a profit year  but they would prefer to have a larger portion of commerci loan in their loan portfolio   manufactur in my district remain uneasi over the pressur they face from global competit  and i doubt whether that pressur is go to dissip ani  e soon   as a member of my small busi advisori council put it last week  old line thinker who look through the busi cycl expect their order book to return to normal are now exit their busi   there is no    normal    ani more  recess and their immedi aftermath account for much of the trend declin in manufactur    share of overal employ  and this cycl is no differ   ceo continu to report that they are use this downturn to reassess their busi strategi  to reexamin their product line  and to reexamin the locat of their facil   as they sort through these option  compani continu to be cautious   or mayb i should say disciplin   about their expans plan  includ their hire plan   their comment  though recent a bit more op ist  do not suggest an impend rebound in hire on the order of magnitud of the acceler that the  book forecast in        product and profit are figur promin in everyon   s think about the busi outlook   ceo report that they can still generat product increas by reorgan their busi process and by implement new product technolog   for exampl  a metal stamper firm in our district report purchas for onli          a machin that cost    million three year ago  and that machin is go to do the work of five peopl   so he expect to make a profit with this technolog and is focus on increas sale  but he   s not go to increas his workforc in the near futur  it   s not entir clear to me how to think about the current high rate of jobless and low rate of capac util   again  i wonder whether these resourc are simpli underemploy or whether they have becom obsolet   the stori of the metal stamper is not uniqu   mani manufactur in my district tell me that resourc  both capit and labor  have lost their econom valu dure the past sever year   perhap the lower econom valu place on these resourc repres a slowdown in potenti output   translat  therefor  what i   ve heard from my district contact into the  book project  i would end up with a scenario close to what presid broaddus and some other talk about earlier this morn   that is  somewhat slower employ growth and somewhat fa  product growth over the next sever year   as     comment earlier  these two factor could still yield rough the same output and incom path as in the  book   but as note by presid broaddus and other  these two factor   slower employ growth with somewhat higher product growth   could also lead to further disinfl   howev  if it   s reason to think that the economi has sustain a slowdown in the rate of growth of potenti  then look forward  the disinfl implic could be less troublesom than in the  book baselin  thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   a preponder of the report on the district economi have been posit  but befor i quick summar those find let me just identifi the sector that are still soft   one  of cours  is commerci construct  where activ is quit subdu   the second is tourism   tourism has improv over  e  but it has still been a mediocr year for that industri in the district   and although busi attitud are certain better than they were nine or twelv month ago  i would have to say that they are still cautious  other than that  though  i think the district economi has track the nation economi reason well  as it typic     we have seen gain in employ in the privat sector over the past sever month  but sinc state and local govern are still reduc employ  those gain have not shown through to ani great extent in the overal job number  strength in consum spend has been sustain  and hous activ and relat measur have strengthen further   i would judg  base on anecdot  that manufactur has improv in the district over the past sever month   one final piec of inform on the district come from a contact who is knowledg about freight shipment through a varieti of mode   that is rail  barg  and truck   and he has report that both volum and price have increas percept in recent month  as far as the nation economi is concern  like the  book i am op ist   if i have ani reserv  it   s the one that i allud to earlier  name that i would expect to get someth like the  book forecast but with greater increas in product and somewhat smaller increas in employ  acknowledg that forecast product in the short run is probabl close to imposs   but if that scenario were to come to pass  that would reinforc my convict that inflat is go to stay low   if one adher to gap analysi  though  i suppos one would have to allow for the possibl that inflat could go even lower   person i think that would be a benign develop  but i realiz that mani peopl around this tabl have come to a differ conclus about that
thank you  mr  chairman   like other  i   ll tri to address two issu   the prospect for growth in activ and the prospect for job   with respect to demand and activ  the question is to what degre the strength of recent month can be sustain next year   it will come as no surpris to my colleagu in light of my recent present to this committe that i   m op ist in this regard   s ul financi condit and fiscal polici are begin to show through to growth   in the absenc of further downward shock or reason for busi or household to turn more cautious  i see no reason whi that won   t continu  with onli a modest downshift in growth from the third quarter as in the staff forecast   while fiscal polici won   t be quit as expansionari next year  it still will be boost demand   moreov  even as privat final demand might moder a littl  perhap react to the falloff in fiscal s ulus  the growth of econom activ should be bol  as more demand is met from product rather than by draw down inventori  financi condit have been expansionari for some  e   they becam a littl more so over the intermeet period as equiti price rose and the dollar fell  while corpor bond rate remain rough stabl or even move down a littl for lower rate credit   whether long term interest rate will eas  as in the staff forecast  i think is somewhat question   but judg from the recent experi  the risk around the assumpt of a slight further declin in the dollar are probabl tilt toward a steeper falloff   moreov  the drag on our economi from weak abroad is abat   to be sure  some of the stronger global prospect reflect a better outlook for the u s  economi   but i   m impress by the rise in interest rate and equiti price abroad over the summer and earli fall  even with the dollar depreci   financi market abroad must be sens some ad domest demand as well  i see upsid and downsid risk to the forecast of reason strong growth along the line of the  book   on the upsid  busi caution may erod fa  than in the staff forecast  where invest spend continu to undershoot forecast base on past relationship with acceler  cash flow  and the cost of capit   in the  book the surpris in the incom data was incorpor into a higher level of gdp and a smaller output gap  while leav growth rate after the third quarter larg unaffect   in effect  the recent data are not interpret as a signal that the dynam of the expans have chang materi  and the return to full employ continu to be relat slow given the low level of interest rate and s ul fiscal polici   the damp respons in demand was reflect in a chart in ye day   s brief  which show that the natur interest rate impli in the staff forecast remain abnorm low  especi relat to the assum relat rapid rate of growth of potenti  growth in the latter should be rais equilibrium real interest rate   but with the rise in profit and equiti price and persist increas in sale  busi respons could return to normal more quick and fulli than is assum in the forecast  allow much more of the natur resili of the economi to show through to even stronger spend   the upward revis to august order data we saw this morn and the further gain in septemb i think underlin this upsid risk  i believ that the major downsid risk is in the household sector  which has been support the economi under the influenc of low interest rate   the save rate remain quit low   both debt and real asset continu to pile up on each side of the household balanc sheet  and the save rate onli edg higher in the forecast   it   s not so much the debt burden that constitut a downward risk  rather it   s the possibl that household may decid that the margin util from a larger hous or anoth suv begin to fall relat to the flexibl and return on greater portfolio of financi asset   we   ve seen no evid of that yet   hous remain remark strong   but it could be that tendenc in this direct have been mask in the short run by the effect of the tax cut   so we will need to watch that the level off in consumpt in septemb isn   t a forerunn  in sum  strong growth go forward seem a reason expect   but the economi is emerg from a high unusu cycl in which previous signpost and histor relationship haven   t provid much guidanc  and ani predict must have an extrem wide confid interv around it   that   s also my conclus regard the forecast of whether even strong growth will erod margin of slack in labor and capit market   we have experienc anoth quarter of an astound increas in product   in this case  for a veri good reason the staff decid not to build the third quarter surpris into either the level or the rate of growth of structur product   this suggest to me some upsid risk on potenti growth  as a number of other have comment   it   s possibl that potenti growth could be stronger than is built into the staff forecast without induc much feedback into spend for a while   low household save suggest that household are alreadi expect fair strong growth in life  incom  busi are clear renew and upgrad capit stock   it   s not yet clear that they see a need to increas that stock veri much to meet expand sale   they still may not be veri confid that sale will grow at a rate that requir larger product capac   in addit  as a number of you have note  they may not see the need to expand capac  judg from the third quarter result  busi have not run out of way to rearrang product process to meet grow demand  my point here is not to second guess the product forecast but to recogn the vast uncertainti about the suppli side of the economi that busi continu to work under   we had   percent growth in the third quarter and a small declin in payrol employ   whatev the growth rate of the economi predict or realiz  even if it   s veri strong  we   ll need to watch actual labor and capit util to infer how we are like to be do relat to our object for high employ and stabl price   uncertainti on both the demand and the suppli side of the economi make forecast base polici especi problemat   fortun  in the current circumst it   s not as import as it often might be   polici is alreadi high accommod  and the economi seem to be head up  but there is enough slack that we can afford to wait for reason definit sign befor decid that the economi is on track for draw down those unus margin of resourc and damp disinfl pressur   until we see that hard evid  in my view the risk to output grow around the rate of growth of it potenti are balanc  and the risk to inflat are like to remain downward   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i don   t have much to say this morn  we   ve plant the flower   now is the  e to watch them grow   there are some risk that a number of you have spoken about   for exampl  labor demand and where that is   one risk that has not been discuss much is fiscal polici   the staff forecast has the fiscal effect declin veri sharpli in        it   s conceiv that  if our friend up on capitol hill get religion  some tax cut may not be extend and we could get some reaction even befor then   it   s also conceiv that  if they don   t get religion  we could see some adjust in interest rate   so i think that set of issu has some danger  i had been a littl worri about the  e becaus of the pattern of retail sale  growth was veri strong in juli and august and weaken quit a bit in septemb   first  the number could be revis   second  the new order statist that we got this morn and the strength in hous seem to beli ani septemb weak  so there may be no particular problem in that pattern   there are some risk  but basic  to return to my previous metaphor  the flower seem to be grow at a healthi rate  and i don   t think we ought to chang either our polici or our approach   with that i   m go to obey dave     s earlier injunct and cede  e   hope a littl to myself   for the discuss on communic polici
thank you  mr  chairman   at everi meet we have to do three thing      assess the economi and risk to the outlook      decid the polici implic  and     talk about communic   recogn that the third topic is go to be excit today   one hope   i   ll tri to be brief on the first two  on the assess of the economi  it   s clear that the third and fourth quarter seem to be extrem robust   one recogn obvious  as ned   just mention  that the pattern particular with respect to real pce growth did slow a littl in septemb   but that  sn   t leav me with ani great concern   i think the overal pattern of pce growth is still well maintain   similar  i would point to the demand for both new and exist home as be veri strong  and this morn   s data on shipment and order also suggest that the third and fourth quarter are like to be veri robust   fortun  it also appear that the sourc of the turnaround seem to be broaden somewhat   the industri sector is start to show some sign of strength   industri product appear to have expand in the third quarter  and it   s possibl that capac util is also start to firm somewhat   i   d say that the labor market  which is the biggest question mark we   ve been deal with    seem to be give some earli sign of stabil   we haven   t talk much about it in this room today but when the septemb job data came out  that got quit a bit of attent in the press  and we shouldn   t forget that the news was posit   similar  the revis to the job declin in juli and august were all in the right direct and were consist with a gradual bottom of the labor market   the four week move averag of initi claim declin a bit  and the household survey data suggest that layoff might be subsid   so overal i   d say that the  book was right in term of move up expect for the third and fourth quarter  that lead to the second issu  which is how one assess the futur   in that regard i can understand and general feel reason comfort with the logic of the  book forecast  the  book assum that the step up in product will continu  though it hasn   t taken in all the increas recent as perman   the s ul polici plus some assumpt about multipli and acceler effect all result in an economi that grow at about   percent per year  creat job and wealth  and then has the unemploy rate fall gradual   as presid broaddus said  the  book forecast is certain easi to love   if i were from the dalla district i   d probabl have a catchi tune about how easi love may be fleet love    laughter  let me talk about the risk that are associ with this forecast   i think it   s easi to see risk on the downsid  as cathi has point out   one of the risk is that so much of what happen in the third quarter and so far in the fourth quarter seem to have been driven by polici s ulus   real pre tax incom was essenti unchang dure the summer month of the year  as that effect start to wane  there   s a possibl that we won   t get quit the kind of uptick that the  book expect   and while   and   gave us a number of stori  if you will  about whi demand for c i loan has been veri slow to turn around  the banker i   ve talk to certain are worri about it   they seem to think that it may realli be a sign of slower growth than the  book forecast suggest   i recent had a meet with the real estat roundtabl  and across the board that group was quit subdu   so some anecdot inform suggest that our staff forecast is a bit more hope than mani peopl  at least mani in the real world  are at this stage   add to that the fact that the  book forecast is alreadi abov the blue chip consensus  and it seem that some concern about the downsid risk is warrant  on the upsid  though  i think one must say that rare at this stage of an expans has the economi seen this kind of fiscal and monetari s ulus   with interest rate extrem low  price stabl  the dollar come off  product increas  financi condit turn  and earn relat strong   those and a varieti of other factor could lead to some upsid potenti around the forecast   so i   d say that even around our relat op ist forecast  while love may be fleet  the risk are relat balanc  with respect to polici  i suspect that  when we get to that point of our discuss  there   s not go to be veri much to say   with respect to communic i  like other  will restrain myself as best i can except to say that i believ the interact between polici and communic today is such that the committe would be veri well advis to take a fair cautious approach   we have a great deal to discuss  and i   d hate for us to get ahead of ourselv in the statement that we make at      today   thank you  mr  chairman
i have a coupl of comment   after two peopl in a row have said that they   re go to be brief  i think i should say exact the same thing  and i will   over the past week i   ve talk to a number of banker whose comment essenti reinforc a lot of what we have heard around the tabl   two communiti banker  one in the upper midwest and one in the southwest  had exact the same observ  they are feel addit competit pressur from the nation   s largest bank as those bank come after the small busi market   that support the appetit for increas risk that we   ve seen around the countri   i think it support also the notion that the slack demand for commerci loan has forc bank to reach toward other kind of loan opportun   a region lender in the midwest had a slight differ perspect  but it was along the same line   he note the differ between the respons he was get from his front line lender as oppos to what he was get from the credit depart peopl   the front line peopl felt that there was a good deal of increas activ but that it had not yet translat into loan   the one except was lend to busi that were exercis purchas option for current leas facil  that  too  support the view that a lot of the lend is either to lock in liquid or to restructur and improv the overal abil of busi entiti to financ growth intern  which is what i think i heard dave   and other say  in talk to some contact in institut and custodi servic busi  a coupl of other trend came to light   one was anoth reaffirm of the shift by consum into equiti  a trend that had been obvious but has becom even more obvious within the last six week   but the institut investor were move offshor  in mani case to emerg asia  which is consist also with the stori in the  book in term of expect for growth there  pull togeth what i   ve been hear   notabl the chang in risk appetit  which was probabl the most obvious   it appear that a lot of lend continu to be for balanc sheet restructur   much of the lend tend to be in anticip of improv in the under economi   to the extent that there are increas in capit expenditur  they are not be reflect in new c i loan in the bank industri   but in compar the feedback we were get with regard to inhibit to capit invest six month ago versus now  i had the impress that there was a signific chang   six month ago we were hear the term    psycholog    or    psycholog     wherea now in describ the under economi contact are use word like    confid    or    op ist    or perhap    cautious      the use of the word    psycholog    suggest that there was an irrat to the decis on capit spend   that the decis were not base on an analysi of the under data but were independ of the data   we were look at strength in consum demand over the period  and that was not be taken into account by the busi sector   now at least the under econom data are be analyz and taken into account to some degre   so while we have not yet seen the same traction as in previous recoveri  the chang in attitud is veri obvious
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to make one comment on current condit and then talk a bit more about the longer run part of the  book forecast   i was struck as i look at the  book forecast about where we are with regard to busi invest in this expans and by some of the inform on capit spend that we   re get from various busi survey  much of which is includ in the  book materi  we   ve alreadi note that corpor cash flow is veri strong and that we   re begin to see some firm up of busi invest   but the respons to the qualit question that are ask in survey clear show that busi are reluct to expand   nevertheless  i think there is a tone that say we   re see a floor here  we   re begin to get out of this slump in invest   that slump was the root of this busi slowdown and  as governor olson was just mention  the word are start to turn posit   but the vigor of corpor expans has yet to take hold   i think the recent inform show again that we clear have a way to go  it worri me when i look at how much stop and go we   ve had in the economi in the last two year   the  book forecast is assum that there are no real shock come   we   ve had a number of shock in the past few year   last year busi inventori grew  but then we had the shock of a war in the spring   there have been so mani start and stop in this recoveri that it may take a littl longer to prove that there is some stabil out there and to get busi into an expans mode versus just a replac mode   clear their financi strength is extraordinari   the corpor cash flow and earn number come out this quarter all look veri  veri strong  in think about the longer term forecast and where we are head  i was struck  too  by the wonder op  in the  book forecast compar with some of the outsid forecast   i just want to comment on two aspect of this that i   m still sort through in my own mind   one is that we   ve had an extraordinari run in product over the last few quarter   yet when we look forward  product growth for the last six quarter of the  book forecast fall below the recent number   i understand that a big part of the product perform is cyclic   but the project drop in product growth is come right when the economi is realli pick up   so we have this tension in the forecast  i think  where we see employ grow   extraordinari job growth   and product slow   yet we still have inflat trend down until the tail end of the forecast period   in the street  as market observ talk about expect   and it   s a factor in our communic polici   they say that onc employ start expand  inflat is go to pick up   that is go to be one of the challeng we face if we believ in the  book forecast   in fact  of all the altern scenario  there   s onli one that result in an inflat rate that   s within hail distanc of   percent   and that   s due onli to the fact that peopl   s inflat expect are higher than actual inflat   basic in this forecast  depend on the inflat measur  we will have had four or five year of inflat number that start with a   or below  which would be an extraordinari period of low inflat   that psycholog is not what most observ have in their mindset  nor is it part of the busi recoveri model that we see in the marketplac   so we need to think about how we talk about these issu go forward
thank you  mr  chairman   i was interest in the like evolut of the feder fund rate over the next two year   so i ask the staff to use their best fit es  taylor rule togeth with both  book and privat sector forecast to project some sampl interest rate path   the rule the staff chose were a backward look taylor rule es  over the         period and a forward look  or forecast base  taylor rule es  over the same period use fomc central tendenc forecast on the right hand side plus some addit data assumpt   by the way  this latter rule is the one discuss in some detail in dave     s magnum opus on communic   both taylor rule allow for error correct term   that is  a lag interest rate in the equat   the project were run use actual data plus either  book or blue chip forecast on the right hand side and then compar with fund rate forecast obtain from the fed fund futur market   note that this exercis treat the  book forecast as given   no attempt was made to reconcil the fund rate project obtain with the fund rate assumpt use in deriv the forecast  let me summar a coupl of interest result from this exercis   first  the backward look rule would have the current fund rate at about      percent   the actual current valu of   percent presum reflect in part our insur polici against deflat   assum that the extra    basi point are phase out in a linear way over the next two year  the path that is suggest by the backward look rule would go about as follow   it   s current at   percent  it would be      percent by the end of the first quarter of next year       percent at the end of the second quarter       percent at the end of       and final      percent at the end of        the backward look rule appli to the blue chip data gave a fair similar  though slight more aggress  path through        the blue chip data don   t go out far enough to do a project through        what i found most interest about the result use the backward look taylor rule is that they correspond extrem close to what come out of the futur market  the number are almost exact the same   so the main lesson i learn from this exercis is that the market is use histor relationship and backward look type taylor rule to figur out what we   re go to be do in the futur  there was an interest contrast to the result when i use the forward look rule   in particular  the forward look taylor rule impli a much slower tighten process   inde accord to that project  the fund rate will reach onli      percent by the end of      rather than the      percent forecast by both the futur market and the backward look rule   the  book forecast horizon  sn   t permit a project through       though  so i couldn   t make that comparison   whi the differ   mechan  the differ aris becaus the forward look rule put a high weight on inflat expect  and of cours  use the  book forecast we have a veri low inflat rate expect over the forecast period   so that   s the mechan reason  which of these rule should we take more serious   person  i see some advantag in the forward look rule for two reason   one is that it   s a true real  e rule   that is  it es  reaction function given actual forecast avail at the  e the polici decis was taken   second  as governor bie mention  we   re now in a period that is veri unusu  and histor relationship may not work   so it   s use that the forward look rule can take into account explicit how forecast affect current polici decis   the implic of this  i think  are interest   to me it say that our polici stanc is go to depend veri much on what we think inflat is go to do   suppos we buy the  book forecast on inflat   i   m not make a judgment here  i person think that inflat will remain low and stabl over the forecast period  but not everyon     but if we do agre with that inflat outlook  then at least base on this es  rule our polici tighten should be slower and more gradual than suggest by histor relationship or by the fund rate futur market   that lead final to two conclus   one is that we should be especi vigil about the inflat rate and where we think it   s go to go   second  we have an ongo communic issu   if this is the way that polici proceed  over  e in one way or anoth we will have to bring expect in the market in line with our actual polici  let me make one brief comment on communic   i just want to say that i veri much appreci the contribut and thought peopl have had  and i   m veri open to the kind of modif that have been suggest   but i would echo governor     s suggest that for the  e be we go relat slowli   thank you
thank you veri much   we now go to   reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the materi that   low hand out dure the coffe break   as shown in the top left panel of your first exhibit  investor seem to have rais the path expect for the feder fund rate over the cours of        they are still count on cumul tighten to bring the feder fund rate to   percent by the end of       but they are now bet on the committe to be a bit quicker in get there   that said  market particip appar don   t anticip that process to begin at this meet or the next   futur rate over the balanc of the year are unchang at   percent  moreov  as shown in the tabl at the right  primari dealer do not expect ani substant chang in the econom assess issu this afternoon   with onli a coupl of except  they expect you to announc that risk are balanc with respect to your growth object and tilt to the downsid with regard to price stabil  with the latter remain the predomin risk   other manifest of this shift in expect are given in the middl panel  the solid black line in the middl left panel plot a measur of uncertainti about the feder fund rate expect in the next six month   for most of the summer and earli fall  investor have been relat confid that the fund rate will remain near current level six month henc  no doubt import becaus of your assur in the statement of august and septemb that polici can be kept accommod for a consider period   in recent week  though  there has been a grow sens that a turn point may be draw closer  and this measur of impli volatil has move higher   the middl right panel plot the distribut of the feder fund rate about six month ahead deriv from option quot ye day  the solid bar  and just befor the septemb meet  the dash line    more weight is now be place on fund rate in the neighborhood of

includ a modest contribut made over the intermeet period   i list this improv in financi condit first at the top of the next exhibit  which outlin the case for an unchang target feder fund rate   you may view eas financi condit to be one consequ of the current accommod stanc of monetari polici   as shown in the middl panel  the real feder fund rate  repres by the solid line  lie below the rang of es  equilibrium real rate  inde  a firm outlook for the economi has meant that r  is an upward move target   keep the real feder fund rate unchang in such circumst impli a widen interest rate gap   that may be especi troubl if you think that pressur on resourc may emerg a bit fa  than the staff forecast   as shown in the bottom left panel  in the  book project  the near term surpris in the level of real gdp has been carri over the entir forecast period  the differ between the dot line for septemb and the red line for octob   particular if you thought that there was some risk that the most recent surpris also tilt up that red line some or that the speed of it ascent repres loom pressur on inflat independ of the output gap  you might be inclin  at a minimum  to keep polici on hold  financi market particip may be express just those sort of concern in the upward climb in inflat compens as measur from the treasuri market  the bottom right panel    these measur have move higher look over the next five year  the black line  and from five to ten year ahead  the red line    of cours  inflat compens is a far from perfect proxi for inflat expect  and these measur have not broken notic out of their rang of the previous four year  but you might believ a neighborhood of   to     percent to be on the high side of your object   to be sure  a pickup in pressur on inflat is not part of the staff forecast  inde  the case for eas    basi point  which is laid out at the top of exhibit    could rest on the view that  as resourc slack linger  inflat may drift into an unaccept low region   if it is not alreadi there   in the  book baselin  the unemploy rate  seen as a solid line in the middl left panel  make onli a gradual approach to it natur rate of   percent by the end of        polici eas at this  e might be view as help in work down econom slack more quick  moreov  such monetari polici impetus would be welcom after the fact if a less robust expans eventu   in part   of the  book  the staff use the frb us model to consid what would happen if the econom recoveri falter at the begin of next year  the implic of which are plot as the dash line in the middl left panel for the unemploy rate and in the middl right panel for pce inflat   wors still for the unemploy rate would be if this hesit in econom expans led market particip to move up their desir compens for risk  the dot line    in circumst in which actual inflat is low  inflat expect are fair well contain  and a sizabl output gap remain  put just a bit of weight on the advers outcom of the dash and dot line might inclin you toward polici eas   that inclin might be strengthen by the fact that inflat is project to fall to below   percent in      in either of these scenario   last  at recent meet  some member took encourag from the perform of financi flow as evid that there was some fundament support to econom growth   as report in the bottom left panel  on a twelv month chang basi  m  growth has turn down in it most recent read   we think that relat import to the effect of a slow of mortgag refinanc on liquid deposit and so is not a read on the vigor of the economi  but we may be wrong   concern about the perform of m  might be underscor by the fact that other financi flow  includ  as seen at the right  busi loan growth  commerci paper issuanc  and bond issuanc  have all been anem of late   the remain issu for your consider center on languag  which is the subject of your final exhibit   two point of procedur about that languag   first  we includ a fuller discuss of altern for the word of the announc in the bluebook  in the hope of get some feedback from the member   we did get some  and in the futur we will circul on the afternoon befor the meet a summari of all the comment receiv by close of busi friday   second  in the bluebook  we assum that you intend to fit this afternoon   s statement within the current structur and reserv ani discuss of chang to that structur for later   within that structur  the top panel repeat a tabl from the bluebook and show that there are onli a limit number of combin of the assess of the risk to growth and inflat that seem plausibl among the nine that are logic possibl  the current word lie squar in the blue box  in which risk to sustain econom growth are seen as balanc and inflat more like to fall than not  with low inflat be the predomin concern   while the econom outlook has improv  much of that improv remain a forecast  not firm establish in the data   especi so for read on the labor market   that said  spend indic have shown vigor  and the most like transit in the near term would presum be a move from that blue box to the yellow box  in which the risk to sustain econom growth are view as weight to the upsid   move the assess on the inflat outlook to balanc  the   box  seem like to be a subsequ step  given the current room for the economi to run befor resourc slack is work down   the committe   s willing to chang the languag at all must presum be relat to how it view the last sentenc in the august and septemb announc  the relev portion of which is repeat in the middl left panel   you might be comfort in repeat that    polici accommod can be maintain for a consider period    if you believ the  book forecast is like   the staff   s assess of the current shortfal of the level of aggreg demand below that of potenti aggreg suppli  the like expans of aggreg suppli over  e  and the relat unrespons of inflat to diminish slack in resourc util combin to suggest that the committe could keep the fund rate at   percent through      and fo  accept econom perform   an examin of privat sector opinion  howev  may leav you with more concern about the definit of a    consider period      as shown in the middl right panel  read on money market futur contract suggest sizabl weight on polici tighten that bring the fund rate to    percent by midyear   wall street economist  the solid line repres the median of a survey of invest banker  also expect firm  but a littl bit more delay   as outlin at the bottom left  drop the sentenc at this meet may risk an outsiz market reaction  as investor begin to wonder if the path for polici embed in futur rate is not aggress enough for your tast   one possibl would be to convert the refer from calendar to econom  e   that is  the committee= definit of a consider period could be made conting upon the outlook for further disinfl   one such possibl  given at the bottom right  would have the statement read that    the committe believ that polici accommod can be maintain for the consider period it current assess will be requir to fo  the moder of disinflationari pressur      the committe consid such a chang at the septemb meet  felt it to be a close call  and ul  decid that alter the languag would draw more attent than warrant   you may feel yourself still to be in that posit at this meet
thank you   question for
in the top panel of exhibit    there is a column label    unwelcom fall      one thing we   ve learn in the last two quarter is that product has been extraordinarili strong   certain the probabl of a declin in inflat from  let   s say  the level in the forecast may be reason remot  but the proport of it that may be welcom may have chang becaus of a shift in suppli   there   s no mechan for reflect the fact that not all declin in inflat are unwelcom
well  i would say that  on one level  rapid growth in aggreg suppli onli rais the bar for the growth of aggreg demand that the committe should desir to get the outcom it want   so in that sens  there still could be unwelcom declin in inflat
but they would not be associ with problem relat to the econom expans   in general the link of    unwelcom    and    disinfl    or    a pickup in inflat    may pose a problem in the current structur of this languag   it   s a problem that presid  n also refer to in his discuss of disinfl as not necessarili be problemat   but i would say that  from the committe   s perspect  a declin in inflat from current level  while perhap not pose a threat of serious damag to the economi if it is due to a rapid increas in the aggreg suppli  may send the inflat rate below your longer run object
but it appear as though it would be less unwelcom than we may have thought befor we knew what was happen to product
in that regard  you do have your other assess to separ the distinct between less unwelcom and more unwelcom   an unwelcom declin in inflat that was associ with a grow resourc gap would presum be closer to those pernici deflat that member have express concern about in the past   a declin in inflat associ with balanc econom growth or even upward pressur on econom growth would have differ implic for polici   one thing that   s fair clear to me in work on the communic polici is that committe member realli want a lot of differ toggl switch in the statement to express conting like this
well  in my effort to communic better with you  i feel better   laughter
just rememb  if you want to pars word     unwelcom disinfl    is part of disinfl   you can size it howev you so choos   that   s what our communic problem is get us into   further question for     presid santomero
in regard to presid parri   s comment  perhap the problem here is that we   re tri to combin two differ issu regard inflat in this chart   name  the probabl of inflat move up or down as current forecast and a qualit evalu of that   mayb we should separ the two   defin the risk of inflat fall  say  which the committe might then describ as desir or undesir depend upon the circumst  what i   m struck by is the asymmetri reflect in this box   we have valu judgment associ with the column but no valu judgment associ with the row   it   s not clear whi we   d necessarili want to start off by have valu judgment associ asymmetr
i view that as a serious problem with the current structur of the languag   in the propos discuss in the two memo that i circul  i separ out the first two statement as be declar statement about your forecast couch in probabl term   the probabl of inflat rise or fall and the probabl of growth abov or below a sustain rate   then i ladl in the welfar judgment  the judgment about relat cost in your object function   that is  everyth that relat to risk manag in a central bank is put into that third sentenc
essenti i   m agre with that approach  given the difficulti of communic the altern  which blend the two togeth
the more we go into how to slice and dice and stress test all of these various formul   whether it   s the current one or the one   propos in his octob    memo   the more difficult and complic this whole process becom   it is fraught with untoward circumst or unintend consequ   i think we need to take a big step back   not today  for purpos of this meet   in consid these various propos   as i and a lot of other peopl around the tabl suggest  given that we   re not like to chang polici  let   s stay as close as we can to what we have been say   mayb we can fiddl with it or add word to the    consider period    or mayb not  depend on how we come out on that   but i   d say leav it alon  the atmospher is realli difficult out there  and i don   t think the recent newspap articl did us one bit of good in term of provid us with some flexibl to chang thing  even if that were desir now   and i wouldn   t agre that it is   i believ we realli need to think about this a lot longer and a lot harder   i for one would want to take a big step back and even think about whether we want to continu with a formul that came out of the old tilt  whi do we want to continu do that   whi do we want to put out inform about the futur that we   re all uncomfort with   say whi we did what we did has enough of a futur impact without ad all this inform about risk when we realiz that there   s a great deal of uncertainti about the risk   that   s a discuss for anoth  e   mayb at lunch or in januari  i just want to encourag us  pleas  not to do anyth veri differ this  e   there   s so much to talk about just in term of this grid  let alon the seven or eight variat that you put in your octob    memo   also there   s ned   s propos  which i think has some attract to it  let   s just stop now and tri to figur out what we   re go to do   we can have a littl convers over lunch and take it up again in januari
further question for     if not  let me just say that cathi is rais a general concern that i think we all share   one can see it by tri to use languag to calibr mechan that are digit   everi technician will tell you that that lead you nowher   in ani event  we   re go to get a clarif of the outlook in the next coupl of month  and it will be signific in the sens that christma sale will be a fundament test of consum attitud go forward   that will resolv the issu of what part of the tax cut actual was spent in the third quarter      percent accord to goldman sach  signific less accord to most other   we   ll know that by the  e of the januari meet   the labor market are either turn or they   re not   the evid suggest that they are  but again  we   ll need more  e to make that judgment   obvious capit spend is a crucial issu  and that is appar improv   again the question is  if i may use a new term  whether it is    slog    away    paus   there are not mani foreign polici buff around this tabl    laughter
that   s anoth reason for not use the term  by the way    laughter
if it turn out that the economi  after go through this recent surg  simmer down veri dramat and inde exhibit weak  then from a polici point of view we   re obvious well posit at this stage   i think a weaken in econom activ is unlik   i believ it   s more like that evid of an old fashion busi cycl expans is begin to emerg   the piec are fall into place   some are littl thing like the upward revis to profit  which have been except extens   we haven   t seen anyth like these number sinc the height of the boom back in the     s   we   re see for the first  e this year an uptick in the long term outlook for earn per share  unlik in previous period  the economi is move forward larg on the basi of final demand  as i think dave mention   there is no question that in juli and august firm were liquid inventori  and the data we have for septemb confirm that the liquid continu through the end of the quarter   my recollect is that  when i saw the origin  book project that had inventori liquid continu through the rest of the year  i was incredul   i was even incredul about it continu in the third quarter   but clear that   s what we   re see   inde  the data on durabl good inventori for manufactur confirm that this morn   it is probabl the case that motor vehicl inventori did rise in octob  just judg from the falloff in sale   but there is no evid as yet to suggest ani signific inventori accumul  and in a way that   s probabl good rather than bad becaus we   re look forward to an acceler   purchas manag at manufactur firm  who are probabl best posit to have a sens of whether their custom    inventori are high or low  are report that they are extraordinarili low   sinc all inventori by definit are produc by manufactur  with the except of a few item in mine  lumber  and the like  these peopl are veri focus on the process   basic they are say that the inventori situat is get tighter and tighter   so there   s an upsid risk here  which is someth we have not seen for quit a substanti period of  e  if the economi start to heat up  obvious we   re go to have to creat a credibl exit strategi from maintain an accommod stanc for a consider period   we have a lot of altern  and mayb that   s part of the problem   we may have just too mani widget to push and too mani permut and combin with nineteen peopl to get ani singl set of view  i think we could remind the market that we first use the term    accommod    in earli      when we move the fund rate down to      percent   bob parri has rais that issu public   he got a lot of attent    laughter   anyth that anybodi on this committe say get a lot of attent  larg becaus the truth of the matter is that we are in unchart water  in our person experi we have never been at a point when the inflat rate for all practic purpos is zero   we have reach price stabil   in previous period when the economi was turn and inflat rate were       or   percent  a preemptiv polici move made a lot of sens  but what are we preempt from when inflat is effect at zero   what that mean is that we have a lot of  e to sit and watch the process go forward   but as ben bernank point out  one possibl explan of what the market are do is that they are mere replic our past behavior  which is call backward look analysi   i think that   s right   that   s what market alway do   it is go to be a fascin process if this economi  as is most like  begin to show far greater sign of under strength and sustain   we   re go to have to work our way through to determin where we need to be on the fund rate  i ought to emphas that we have a number of way of do that   obvious  the accommod issu can be redefin   we can return to an assess of balanc inflat risk   we can say that the risk to sustain growth are on the upsid   or we can rephras how we state the balanc of risk   and we can make all of the adjust with differ  e   for exampl  there   s no reason that we cannot start rais the short term fund rate and still have the next sentenc of our statement indic that we will remain accommod for a consider period of  e   or we can decid to drop that statement at the first stage  but let me emphas this   the bottom line is that we should have the polici that is the right polici   if we actual allow this whole question of who say what and how the press will read it   whether it   s up  down  or sideway   to affect our judgment regard the implement of the op um polici  we are make a veri bad mistak   the peopl out there who are in either the cheer or the boo section know less than we do  and they demonstr that period   whenev i suspect otherwis they dissuad me    laughter  so the first thing we have to do is to decid what we want to do   then as a wholli separ exercis we need to determin how we want to explain it  in what manner  and to whom  if we intermix these two issu  we   re make a veri bad mistak   if we allow the movement in rate to reflect how we expect market to respond  we   re go to find that we all presum that if we move x the market will respond y  but in fact when we move x the market will do someth els   we can   t be sure how the market will respond   there is no solut to that dilemma   in my view  we have to keep that in mind in the discuss we   re go to have short   we have to separ polici from communic  have said that  we do have to determin what we want to say in our press statement after we decid what we want to do on polici   i agre with those around the tabl who have caution against do anyth signific differ today   i say that becaus i have no idea how the market will respond   i know everyon has his or her own view about that  and i appreci that   but anybodi who say he has a clue about how the market will react is in my judgment express a lack of knowledg  as far as i   m concern  the polici issu today is straightforward   i think there   s no issu with respect to the appropri polici   polici is actual work well   it   s hard to rememb this  but not too long ago we were look at the possibl of an awesom downsid on the inflat rate  and we weren   t sure we had the tool to deal with it   we know exact what to do on the upsid   we may not get it right  but we know what to do   as a consequ  we may have look at the  book forecast six month ago and ask what dave   was smoke   well  whatev it was  it was pretti good    laughter  my bottom line is that at this stage we have to make minor adjust in the first paragraph   we can   t talk about weak labor market  we need to say we   re in a period where they   ve stabil or someth like that   but i   d just leav the rest of the word alon and ship it out and go work on someth els   that is my recommend  and i   d be interest in your reaction   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i support you complet   sinc we   re into metaphor today  here   s mine   with regard to the communic part of your recommend  with the second paragraph i think we have dug ourselv into a hole and we   re tri veri hard to get out of it but all we   re do is get in deeper   let   s put the shovel down  think about it  and climb out of this hole later   that   s whi i   d say leav the paragraph exact the same
presid pool  what do we do about the shovel   laughter
i was go to comment that i think the minut that will come out on thursday are go to help a lot   on page    there   s some import languag that emphas that the    consider period    has to be interpret in the context of the evolut of the economi  not in the context of calendar  e   i believ that languag is go to help to get us to a much better posit in the futur   i would also note that there   s an old say that the best tax system is an old tax system   i think that   s probabl true of communic strategi as well   we need to develop a standard strategi   if we   re go to be review our communic polici at some length later  it   s best not to have a whole seri of chang along the way until we complet our review   in the mean   we should let the issu sit as quiet as possibl
i meant to say that  and i don   t think i said it explicit  we realli ought to have the simul exit strategi spell out in full detail befor we take the first step   we have to know where we want to end up under various condit so that we don   t find ourselv as perpetu ditch digger   presid broaddus
i concur with your recommend  mr  chairman  and i like tom   s metaphor

our next meet is tuesday  decemb    excus me  i forgot to mention that there   s essenti no chang in the press statement   now  what   s your pleasur with regard to the discuss on communic   do you want to talk over lunch or do you want to recess and come back
what i propos  mr  chairman  is for everybodi to go get lunch and come back to the tabl   when everyon settl down  i can read some brief remark  and then we can proceed with the discuss
okay  that sound good   is that satisfactori to everybodi  good  let   s go to lunch   lunch break
let   s turn to   reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi call    brief on fomc communic polici    that   low hand out while you were get lunch   one of my favorit quot  which offer some perspect on my work on the committee= communic polici over the past few month  come from   of orang  who held that    you need not hope to undertak nor succeed to persever      when it come to the structur of the committe   s assess of the outlook  i can report to the member that your secretari has undertaken and persev but see littl hope of success   to rais the odd just a bit  i would appreci it if you would use the  e until      p m  to provid some feedback on a few key issu   to facilit that discuss  i have list in the first exhibit some altern way of assess risk   i start with the pre march balanc of risk languag to establish that some progress in the committe   s communic has been made   the second    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     panel give the current word  the next is the propos in my memo date octob     and the last is the suggest of governor   circul at that same  e   these panel are for your refer   what i will focus on are the four question list in exhibit     in particular  do you have a clear prefer for the risk assess among the various propos that have circul   if there is a basic structur identifi today  then the task of home in on specif languag will be easier   second  in that process it would be help if the committe provid guidanc as to whether it want a bilater or a multilater approach to arriv at new languag  by that i mean that i can get feedback from the member individu and iter on new draft languag or i can look for opportun to schedul a discuss of these matter by the full committe   a middl ground would be to consid charg a subcommitte with the task  but onli a few member have express enthusiasm for that   third  how much import do you place on wrap up this issu quick  mani of you have express concurr with postpon the adopt of new languag  often with the comment that you   d rather have it done right than done quick   a countervail consider  howev  is the observ that the economi seem to be improv  perhap at a pace that would make you anticip chang at least some part of the risk assess in the near futur   if so  there is a question of sequenc   do you want to grappl with modifi the exist languag to express a new tilt  or would such a transit be an appropri  e to adopt a new structur   fourth  when do you want to talk about this next   look at the calendar  there are three immedi opportun   i could set asid  e on the decemb   agenda after the polici decis to consid the matter  and you could decid perhap not to be bound by the      p m  deadlin   i could arrang a dinner meet on decemb    the night befor that meet   third  this could be the subject of the discuss on the tuesday afternoon of your next two day meet in late januari   with ani of those option  though  you might want to take into consider how the public will react to news that the committe is onc again talk about communic  especi if you are not certain that the convers will bring closur  at least for now
whi don   t you put each question on the tabl and ask for comment
the first question is  is there ani clear prefer as to the basic structur of the assess of the outlook
mr  chairman  befor we talk about that  could i say a word about my draft word
as i   ve said befor  i   ve not fanci myself a communic expert  so i do this a bit reluct   but the thing i   m increas have troubl with in our statement is that our assess of the economi are not benchmark   as i said in my memo  the phrase    sustain growth    some  seem to mean that the economi is grow at the normal rate  but that growth could be associ with ani unemploy rate   some  the term mean close the output gap   in the top paragraph on page    of the bluebook    actual say that if the    sustain econom growth    sentenc mean this  then one thing follow  and if the sentenc mean someth els  then anoth thing follow   we   re deal with enough uncertainti here without have uncertainti about what our own languag mean  i think we could clear do better   with regard to inflat  describ it as rise or fall  sn   t help me   i   d like to see our assess of inflat compar with some desir level  so i have suggest a version that attempt to put in benchmark   that   s all it    i tri to stick with the rest of the languag as much as possibl   i have receiv a lot of favor comment on this by e mail  though i won   t say from whom   you can speak for yourselv today  but i think there   s a lot of interest in this   i was about to offer to host a donor   s confer to see if we could get the languag on this right   but it may be that     s procedur step will take care of that  and i   m happi to turn this back over to the staff   howev  i think a key issu is whether the committe want to benchmark the assess of the economi   i veri much do
i think we have to be a littl care here becaus there is a prerequisit to this discuss that we don   t talk about  name how much can we ration expect monetari polici to do   if we believ that monetari polici has the capabl of affect the economi increment in all sort of way   to creat whatev level of unemploy  gdp growth  and inflat we choos   and we can implement polici that will accomplish such object  then i can see announc veri explicit target level   my problem with that type of polici commit is that it promis far more than monetari polici has the capac to deliv  we have to be veri care about what we set up as our goal  we need to make sure that they are reachabl goal   if we say  for exampl  that our goal is to get the unemploy rate down to     percent with a growth rate in gdp that would close the output gap by x percent or someth like that  that   s all well and good   but do we actual have the capac to accomplish that   my answer is that we most certain do not   now  if inde the e mail you   re get come from member who believ that we can  that   s an import issu   we have to stay within the bound of what we believ this committe can do  and i just want to make sure that that is explicit recogn befor we go further
may i respond to that   i think the issu is not whether we get to full employ in some reason period but how our polici is structur given the way we see output relat to some object   i see the issu as how best to say that we are tri to work in a direct of expans or contract  whichev the case may be  but not in ani sens promis that we would achiev a goal   and i   d be perfect symmetr with inflat   i would say that we see inflat abov the level we consid desir or below it  and therefor our polici is x   so i don   t think this approach contain a promis that we will get to a goal   but i believ we can illumin our action by specifi the direct toward which we are work and how we are tri to influenc the economi   that is frank what i do in make decis when i come to our meet   if that   s what i do   and i think that   s what most of you do   then it seem to me that we ought to be abl to talk about it in those term
inde  i think everyon   that becaus we all have our own object and henc when we vote we make polici decis base on those object  implicit we all do that  or els we would not be abl to come to a conclus   what i   m argu against is the capac of the member of this committe to have a similar view on all of the goal  we realli can   t achiev that sort of unanim   a major determin it   becaus each individu member has to be free to make a final judgment on the basi of whatev conceptu framework he or she has with respect to the economi   if we all had the same conceptu framework  i will acknowledg that the proposit you are argu would enhanc our transpar   but frank  know all the member of this committe  i think we   d have troubl get a philosoph agreement among all nineteen peopl on how the economi work to the degre that is requir to formul monetari polici   i   d say that would be veri difficult  governor
first  i want to start with a quot  go on to make some point  and then answer     s question     open with a quot from   of orang  and i   ll start with one from winston churchil  who said that in matter of communic    victori is never final  and defeat is never fatal      so i want to encourag us to keep go becaus whatev happen we will not get to the end point  second  i come from a background in consult  and one of the first thing i learn in consult was to defin the natur of the problem   that lead me to discuss a littl survey that i found   the question was    the fed disclos enough inform about interest rate polici  thirti four percent of the respond said that they felt well inform  anoth    percent answer    yes  there was enough inform but it was a littl too confus        percent said the fed is    too secret     and a surpris   percent said that the fed provid too much inform   i don   t suggest that this survey was scientif and  obvious  if it didn   t support my point of view i wouldn   t have brought it up    laughter   but the reason i rais it is that i think we have to be veri care here   although we   ve suffer critic  boo as well as cheer  i   m not so sure that we need a dramat chang in our communic   we need a chang for sure  but i   m not convinc that we need a dramat chang that may again throw the market into uncertainti about what we   re tri to do   i would caution us  as we go through this exercis  to recogn that our communic polici is not perfect by ani stretch of imagin but it   s not complet broken   so i would encourag us to think about increment chang  if you will  that said  let me get to the answer to     s first question regard a clear prefer as to the basic structur of our statement   on this i pick up from where toni santomero was in the earli part of the meet   i believ it would be veri help in the forward look part of our statement for us to separ the two issu that are now combin   one part would liter be an indic of how we think the economi is like to evolv or chang   whether we think growth is pick up or slow down and whether inflat is pick up or slow down   that would involv just a factual statement  if you will   the second part would give some sort of valu judgment or welfar assess  whatev the term may be   i think whoever said that the nine box matrix in the bluebook seem to combin those two concept was right   in my view our communic need to disentangl them   one of the weak in the earlier risk assess   it had sever weak that we discov over  e   was that too mani thing were entangl into a relat small number of word   so in term of my prefer as to the structur  i   d like a structur that clear break out our sens of the outlook as a factual statement versus the valu judgment relat to our goal  a second prefer i have is to avoid languag that is too precis in term of specifi a varieti of goal or target   we don   t have collect a well state goal on unemploy  for exampl   i   m not sure we all share the same point of view regard potenti   we don   t necessarili have the same point of view about the desir level of inflat   we all think it should be low  obvious   probabl in a rang between   and   percent on certain measur   but we don   t have a target that is well defin by the committe   so i   d be quit cautious about go too far down the path toward languag that impli that we have specif target or that forc us to continu to answer question about what exact our goal are or what we deem accept   i think we have to maintain some vagu in that regard  the third rule i   d have in my prefer as to the structur is that it be stress test  perhap use some of the nine box in the matrix approach that   suggest in his memo   one of the problem with the earlier languag was that  although we did attempt to stress test it  we didn   t forese a period with a larg output gap  inflat fall  and growth rise dramat abov potenti   so the tradeoff that were built into the old balanc of risk  though they last for about three year  didn   t last into the most recent period   i won   t blame the previous director of monetari affair for this    laughter   it would inappropri to do such a thing   but let the record show that he   s nod his head  support my comment in one way or the other   in ani event  i do think that we need to take some more  e and do some stress test  that said  for reason the chairman allud to  i must say that i was drawn to     s languag in his memo of octob    as an approach that perhap could work   the last thing i   d say about my prefer  have gone through this three year period or so with the statement structur the way it is now  is that if we do make anoth chang  we need to recogn that it probabl won   t be the last chang   so i think we realli should be aim at enough stress test   and mayb it   s impli in the stress test   to allow us to stay with the new languag for longer than a three year period   we may never succeed in do that  but the goal of stress test is to think of as mani potenti permut as possibl   i thought     s nine box did that to a larg degre   so that   s my answer to the first question in term of prefer   i have these two or three prefer  recogn as i said that we   re not in a horrif bad posit  though obvious we do need to continu to move forward on communic issu  thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i don   t have a quot  but i am remind of a life experi  which was the first  e i ate a raw oy    somebodi forgot to tell me to let it slide down   instead  i began to chew on the darn thing  and the more you chew on an oy  the tougher it get to swallow   i might have been closer to be readi to make some judgment on communic issu at our dinner meet last month than i am now   if anyth  it has becom clearer to me that this subject is veri complic   there are more option   ned   s idea are fascin but rais some new question   the discuss today rais still more   so i   m not close to be readi this afternoon to start choos  i may be in the minor in this view  but despit the fact that we   ve alreadi talk about this issu and some idea are on the tabl  i   m not sure each of us has realli had a chanc to put our best idea on the tabl   i don   t think we can do that in a one hour dinner meet  and i don   t think we can do that in a one hour session at an fomc meet   so if we can get by until the januari meet  i have a rather strong prefer for ask a small group of either princip or senior staff to get everybodi   s best idea and sort through the option to a point where we can effect work with them   that would give us some  e to think this out more care  and we could devot a whole afternoon to discuss it thorough at our januari meet and tri to get it as right as we possibl can   i think we   d be best serv if we took that kind of  e and care to tri to sort some of this out   it has gotten veri complic   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i more or less share the view that presid guynn express   one of the thing i did in prepar for this discuss was to go back to the press releas that we use in januari        after some consider thought  the committe   right or wrong   put that word togeth   it work veri well as far as i   m concern   then some special circumst came up  and we made chang in that word   they serv their purpos but now we have some fallout from that   we ought to go back to the earlier languag as a start point   not to the languag we   re now use  which was put togeth ad hoc piec by piec  but back to the base   let   s think it through and see what we need to modifi in that languag   if it make sens  i   d keep the structur as close to that earlier version as possibl and then move forward   i would not tri to figur out word today or choos now among sever option   i don   t feel comfort with ani of them   i   d feel reason comfort with what we had befor with some chang to reflect that we   re in a more stabl price environ   so i agre with jack   mayb circumst are chang too quick  and we can   t wait until januari   but we ought to wait at least until decemb  think this through more care  and come up with some option or narrow our option at that point
at the last meet i came away with the impress that what we seem to agre on was that the direct word and the risk assess we vote on should be what we communic to the public   it was import to mani of us   mayb to all of us   that the communic direct reflect our vote   is it naiv     to think that we could focus on the direct word and the risk assess  which we didn   t seem to have too much troubl agre to and vote on today  and find a way for that languag to be what we releas   how long did it take us to agre on that word today   two nanosecond
although what you agre on formal were instruct to the drafter of the statement   i think in the propos
what we agre on is what is go to appear in the minut
what normand read was from the page in the bluebook
yes  mr reinhart   that isn   t ident to what is in today   s press releas for the follow reason
oh  i know that
this is a minor issu becaus we can readili do what bob is say in that context
the propos was that  when you decid on a risk assess  what you vote on would be what appear in the direct   i think everyon agre to that   the problem for this meet oper was that  if you decid to adopt languag that differ from what you use at the last meet  we would not have known what the altern would be
okay   isn   t the goal to get the languag in the vote and the press releas the same   whi should that be so difficult   base on what i   ve read in the last coupl of week  it   s extrem difficult   i don   t understand whi   mayb we need an english teacher or grammarian
no mayb about that
the troubl is that  when you run into a problem  you tend to add adject and adverb to ani statement
yes  i notic
and it becom the oy  that jack   s been chew on   laughter   presid pool
i agre with jack that we need to do some hard background work and have an extend session in januari to review where we want to go on this   one dimens of this on the tabl is the issu that ned rais at the outset have to do with object and whether we can use sharpen that languag   i think anoth veri import dimens that we need to address is the extent to which we want to foreshadow or hint about the futur polici direct  my own view is that whenev we regard the risk as unbalanc   i   ll say serious unbalanc just to make my point clear   we should move the fund rate right away   we should move it at the meet when we recogn or make an assess that the risk are serious unbalanc  so my prefer would be that we use the balanc risk assess as the explan for whi the adjust did not take place at the current meet and that we never have an unbalanc risk assess go forward   or at least not serious unbalanc   if the risk were that unbalanc  my posit is that we alreadi would have adjust polici   at ani rate  i consid this an import dimens that we need to focus on   i don   t think we can come up with the appropri languag around the tabl today in a situat like this but that   s anoth aspect of our communic polici that we must spend  e on
may i ask presid pool a question
i agre with you  but do you not forese a period where the risk could be unbalanc but not so unbalanc that the committe felt it had to move immedi  in such a situat the tilt is not a hint about polici  but a sens   and this is what i think we   ve been do for two year   that the risk are weight in a certain direct though we   re not so strong in our convict that we feel we need to move polici
obvious there   s a whole continuum here
i understand that  of cours   my concern is that make a statement that the risk are unbalanc and yet not want that to be interpret as a hint about the probabl direct of polici is a veri difficult languag act to pull off   i think the market routin view the unbalanc risk assess as a hint about or at least some probabl regard the futur direct of polici
i think that   s true
i   m uncomfort do that becaus my view is that the polici adjust are primarili driven by surpris or by the new inform that we can   t predict  that   s whi i believ that provid these hint caus problem more than it help   i   m just say that that   s someth we need to discuss
we need to reach some agreement on that   i   m not tri to say that we can come to an agreement here today   but i think some peopl want to provid that hint about the like direct of polici   i did when i first came here   but i   ve chang my mind in live through issu these statement as to whether or not those hint are realli construct
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m happi to wait until januari if that   s what peopl want to do   i would like to express a mild prefer   more than a mild prefer   for governor     s formul   i think it   s import to have benchmark  our current statement and both of the suggest statement have benchmark in the term    sustain growth        unwelcom        desir lower     or    desir higher      so that   s not the question  all of the version have benchmark   i like governor     s formul better becaus his benchmark for output is not whether it is grow abov or below the growth rate of potenti but that it has a trajectori that lead eventu toward full employ  that is a differ concept  but that   s realli what we should be shoot for   i think that   s a better way of think about our object   i understand governor     s comment about break the forecast and the evalu into two part   but in fact the statement suggest by     not do that becaus the forecast for output includ a refer to sustain growth   there is explicit a benchmark for growth  symmetr  but there should be a benchmark for inflat in that same paragraph   to make matter more complic  i might note that i just came from the bank of england  and they don   t issu ani statement at all immedi after their polici meet   they   re veri happi releas the minut a coupl of week after the meet becaus they think that document convey all the subtleti of their discuss much better than a statement
actual  that option should be on the tabl   where i have a problem with what you   re say is this   the notion that disinfl is unwelcom at this junctur is a valu judgment all of us share   as i indic to ned  if we all agre that the desir level of unemploy is x  then that   s in the same categori   if we can stipul that we agre on the desir level for everi one of the goal  what you   re suggest can work   i   m basic say that we   re not go to achiev that   and to tri to do it when it   s patent unattain i think will wast a lot of the committe   s  e   it   s not that in principl it   s bad   i just think it   s utter unachiev   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain agre that we need to clarifi the languag  and we   re not go to get it done today   we could veri well make it until next januari  though i think we would need to work on it in decemb as well and not leav it all for januari  i start by ask what our goal was  and i think i took off from where presid pool was in a sens but came to the opposit conclus   i thought our goal was to help peopl better anticip where interest rate might go   by give them a littl inform as to what we were worri about  we might help them anticip our action a littl better   i don   t think all of our action are key to new inform  new shock   some  we   re at posit where we think we   re more like to do one thing than anoth becaus of how we see the economi develop  and it   s help to the market to tell them that   so this is about chang in interest rate and the like movement of interest rate   also  consist with what presid hoenig was say  i think that was what the subcommitte was tri to do   as ill serv as it might have been by the then director of monetari affair   we were tri to look at chang in the output gap and in the inflat gap that would then lead to chang in interest rate   that lead me to the reinhart languag  which to me is in that same spirit   i agre it  sn   t have benchmark in it  that to me is a separ issu   in my view we don   t need to tell peopl what our benchmark are to help them see where interest rate might go in the futur   we might want to tell them our benchmark  but i think that   s a separ debat  when i look at ned   s version  i did tri to do some stress test on it   perhap i misread it  but it talk about the probabl that econom growth will proceed over the next few quarter at a rate consist with the attain of maximum sustain employ   then it say that    over the same period    the probabl that inflat will be undesir high is below  equal to  or abov the probabl that it will be undesir low   that impli that the  e refer for inflat is the next few quarter and to me that was much too short a  e frame   i ask myself if i answer    equal    to both of those part   that i thought we would be at maximum employ in a few quarter  and inflat would be equal to or abov a desir level   what would i be do with interest rate in that situat   i think i would be rais interest rate if i believ we would be at   percent unemploy some  e next year   or at least i would be prepar the market for that possibl   now  in a privat convers with governor   he inform me that i wasn   t read his word right   but the onli  e refer in his formul is    over the next few quarter      if we mean over the next few year  i think we need to say that  otherwis it impli that monetari polici will not be stabil but will promot overshoot   i just think the benchmark issu is a separ issu   we don   t realli need to do benchmark to accomplish what we set out to accomplish a few year ago   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  the first thing i would say is  jack  when you eat an oy  you realli ought to chew it   that   s what bring the flavor out    laughter   when i think about communic  to me what make a communic good is that it   s direct  clear  and understand   on that score  ned   s suggest word has a lot to offer   it   s direct  and of the altern that we   re consid today  i think it is in some sens the clearest and most understand   it also has an account dimens to it  and i like that   i find the benchmark attract   the one issu  ned   and we talk about this a littl befor   is that the use of employ as a benchmark concept is someth i have to think about   i would have to get more comfort with that   i   ve spent a lot of  e over my career argu for a price stabil mandat   i know i   m push my luck here  but in that regard if we had a more explicit target   or let me say a firmer inflat anchor   i could be more comfort with someth like ned   s propos languag   i think it could work   that   s about where i am on the altern we have befor us  i agre with jack and tom that we need to think this through care   we need to take whatev  e is necessari   certain we can wait until januari  i think the languag we have now will be satisfactori until then   the other point i would add is that  onc we make a decis  the decis itself may warrant a more promin announc than we   ve typic made when we   ve made chang in the past   we may want to releas an extend press statement that lay out the reason as to whi  for the forese futur  we are go to use this new languag   if we are a littl more communic on that score than usual  i think that would help  that   s where i am
in prepar for this discuss i reread the verba  transcript of our dinner meet last month   it was veri interest and inform   i realiz how much i miss some  when i   m think about what i want to say as oppos to what other peopl are say   i was one of the peopl who at that  e did not want to chang much in our statement and for the near term i   m still in that camp   but i   ve come around a lot  to somewher near where presid pool is  and i certain agre with presid guynn and hoenig that we need to give this a lot more thought   we definit have to say what we did and whi we did it   and in say whi we took whatev action we did  we ought to give some sens of the thing that concern us about the current outlook   i realli question   i   m sorri  don   the assumpt that it help the market at all for us to go further than that and talk about the risk of various develop in the futur   i   m not sure it help them   i think it just give them more to chew on in term of what we said  whi we said it  and who said what  and they think about that rather than do their job in the market   they shouldn   t be spend as much  e second guess us as they are   they should be out there do whatev it is market do    laughter  speaker      but we   re the     pound gorilla in the market
well  i know we   re the     pound gorilla  but i think we should avoid a commit about the futur   we should clear avoid ani sens   and somehow tri to correct the belief   that we sit around this tabl tri to figur out what the market are like to do and what we   re go to say to make them do someth differ   the market are go to do what they   re go to do   we have to make our polici the way we call the card   we may be right  or we may be wrong  but we should not be make polici   or even talk about polici   that   s aim at chang how the market oper   they have to oper a bit independ of us  i think   so in the short term i think we did the right thing today   between now and januari we probabl will be come to an appreci of the risk be more balanc   that will chang the languag   that will help us get out of the    consider period    terminolog   in januari   my person prefer is to take a real step back and think long and hard about what the risk statement   for us   if we   re convinc that it   someth good  then we have ani number of formul of languag to go with   if we   re not convinc  then mayb we can find a way to tell the market that they will find out what we did and whi  but we   re go to stop specul on the risk   i don   t care if we use a task forc in the interim   that   s fine by me
well  work backward  i also would be in favor of take our  e on this becaus i do think it   s import   i don   t think we have ani reason to rush   i found the   memo appeal but for a reason that i haven   t heard state  and that is that maximum sustain employ and low inflat are our public polici mandat   those of us who have been through the confirm process were remind of that in our confirm hear   i didn   t look at the transcript of the recent hear  but i suspect that  if senat sarban or some other were there  the nomine may well have been remind of that dual mandat   i don   t see those object as requir a benchmark of ani more numer specif than what we now have  i was involv in an exercis about a year ago with presid broaddus and other in which we review our strateg direct   when we talk about the monetari polici role  we came back to that congression mandat as the start point   so from that perspect  governor     s word appeal to me   also  i suspect that the feder reserv act will not chang signific over the next few year  so it seem to me that  if we have that as the start point  it   s also like that we could stay with such a format   i   m also an incrementalist  and i think we should not make a lot of chang   that   s a compon of the   memo that i find particular appeal
but he goe far beyond what you just said
he has specif number   we just vote on instruct to the feder reserv bank of new york in which we use exact the kind of languag you   re talk about   in fact that happen to be an issu on which we all agre   so we can use that sort of languag   but i think ned is tri to get someth more specif than that   he   s tri to put in hard number or get someth more conclus than a vagu notion of what is maximum sustain growth   if we all agre on what that number was  then we could do it   but that   s not go to happen
i guess i didn   t read it that way
ned  am i misinterpret what you said
i think so
well  then tell me what i   ve said wrong
i don   t see anyth in here that commit us to ani specif goal on either the inflat side or the unemploy side   this actual replac the statement that growth has to proceed at a stabl rate   all it say is that growth is proceed at a rate that in our view is consist with the eventu   and mayb we ought to put in the word    eventu      attain of maximum sustain employ   i don   t think we have to say what that level of employ is  and i don   t think we have to give an inflat target   we could  as al suggest  but the way the statement is written i don   t think we have to   i intent wrote it in a way that we could avoid give specif numer target
well  the question is whether in fact in the real world that is capabl of be achiev
yes  that   s an issu   believ me  i understand that
okay  i withdraw my negat comment   presid
i   ll make a differ negat comment then  mr  chairman   i am concern about have a maximum sustain employ object   i don   t realli mean that it   s not an object   obvious we all agre that it   s in the statut   but i would not put it in the statement   i find it difficult to envis a circumst in which we would ever want to say public that econom growth will proceed over the next few quarter at a rate abov that consist with the attain of maximum sustain employ if the latter is fall short of our object   i don   t think we   re ever go to want to say we   re against more employ  it put us in a veri awkward posit  quit frank   i think the term    growth    has serv us well over mani year  and i person like the term    growth    better here   also  i use to work in the labor depart  so i   m veri sensit to the employ and unemploy part of our mandat  let me turn to the process side  which is the subject i realli want to make most of my comment on   i think we   ve had some veri good suggest today   as i view this go forward  it is worth look care to see if we can craft languag that we   re comfort with that would be a formula approach  which is essenti what we have now   i   d prefer a formula where there are a certain number of option and we pick one at each meet   i think we want to chang the languag  although it   s go to be difficult to do given the differ of opinion  but it would make our decis on the languag a lot easier at each meet if we could find a formula approach   i think it   s worth the effort  and i like the idea of have a task forc that will come back to us with some option or recommend   i also agre that the other option that we discuss befor and reject  name the earlier releas of the minut  is anoth approach that we should consid
that would solv a lot of problem
that   s right  and we could just drop this languag complet   i think it   s worth see what the logist of an earli releas of the minut realli are   we talk about that possibl  and i know it would put a lot of pressur on the board staff to draft the document and on all of us to review it   but i think it   s worth go through a  elin in detail to see what would be involv  and we can determin if we are will to commit to get the minut out in two week or three week or whatev the appropri interv would happen to be   i don   t think we can do what we need to do on these communic issu around this tabl with nineteen peopl   in my view  we ought to have a separ group work on it and come back with recommend   i think that group has to get input from everyon on the committe so that each of us has a chanc to convey our view   we   re probabl go to have to have sever discuss as a committe onc that group report to us
the obvious problem is that if we releas the minut earlier we   ll find that the whole committe is go to want to get involv in edit them  theoret  in my judgment  earlier public of the minut is the ideal solut to our communic dilemma if we could find a way to ensur that we can produc a document that is compar in term of qualiti to what we do now   i don   t know what type of comment   get on the draft minut   but look at the chang  there are veri few   if that inde is the kind of document we would get two week after the meet  we could consid it the major vehicl for communic   i think the valu of that is overwhelm compar with our minc the languag the way we   re tri to minc it in our press releas   mayb we ought to think of a way to do that
we have to address the issu of whether we would get the same kind of product as we do now
yes  that   s correct   that   s the issu   nevertheless  the minut are not bad now   i think they do describ conceptu what we are do
mr  chairman  in answer to presid     s question  i would make one observ   the bank of england is the model for this approach  and they get their minut out in two week   they also have the advantag that everybodi in the polici group is in the same build  so they sit down and devot a half day to edit the minut line by line  the origin assumpt with regard to the januari discuss on communic was that we   d have this issu of the statement behind us by then   our intent was to talk in januari about the earli releas of the minut and an expand use of the central tendenc forecast   the forecast would have a big role in the process becaus the forecast appear in the minut and if the minut are out earlier  the forecast will be  too   the staff is prepar two document relat to that   right now the communic agenda is rather crowd  and ani guidanc as to sequenc would be help
if we could find a way to group the member into a constant align of similar mind peopl  each group could assign one person as a repres to the edit committe   then we could have a small group of peopl sit around edit   i wouldn   t suggest that that   s about to happen
i think your next secretari  mr  chairman  will have a challeng   laughter
would the propos be not to have ani statement after a meet even if we chang polici   would we let everyth ride until we publish the minut   if we   re go to have a statement anyway  we   re still go to have a struggl with the word of a statement
i would drop the balanc of risk part and have the statement be onli this first paragraph regard what we   ve done
we   d stipul what action we took
well  that   s easi  if there   s no explan
there   s go to be an explan  two or three sentenc
there will be an explan but not a balanc of risk statement
yes  we   ll have just the first paragraph of the press releas but not the second paragraph
by the way  as author of the eloqu version of the second paragraph  i would be perfect happi to have that all supplant by the minut if there is a way to do it
well  we realli ought to explor that
we are prepar a document on the earli releas of the minut
whi don   t you tri to do the minut earlier for this particular meet    laughter   this is the easiest meet for which you   ll be abl to do minut   it will give you the baselin of how close you can get to an actual implement of the earli releas option
is this the stress test    laughter
count the year to retir
the minut could say     follow lunch  a vigor discuss ensu with respect to communic       laughter
we   re run out of alloc  e at this particular moment   may i suggest  in order to move this process forward  that in conjunct with the secretariat  we will appoint a committe of governor and presid   an es  group if they wish to join   and see whether or not we can at least narrow this down   we actual narrow it down some today   it appear to me that  if we could find a way to solv the problem of draft and edit the minut more quick  that solut of releas the minut earlier would carri the day in this committe   am i correct in that  sever   yes
but there are problem in do that   mayb we can learn some thing from the british experi and find a mechan that will enabl us to succeed in accomplish that   one possibl   i m just throw idea out in the air   is that at the late januari meet  when we vote on a number of thing  we could vote on an edit committe  in other word  we could appoint a subgroup of this committe that for the come year basic would be charg with the draft requir of the minut   the interest point about that is that to make it work we cannot go back to the full fomc for a decis on the minut becaus if that happen then it becom a wholli indetermin process   i   m just throw out that possibl   there has to be some constraint on the exercis of democraci in this group if we   re go to achiev this goal   the question is what constraint we are will to impos on ourselv   current we all have the opportun for a complet input   it is true statutorili that onli twelv of us can vote  but that has scarc been evid in the discuss within this committe   if somebodi has a good idea even if he or she   not have a vote  that idea may weigh more heavili in the final deliber than the comment of someon who is a vote member   so i think we   ve got to do someth along the line i suggest  may i have the committe   s accept of a notion to set up a subcommitte or work group that will move forward on this subject from where we are   perhap when there is someth to report   could send out a note   and the conclus of that note may well be that we ought to have a phone confer   incident  we now have a videoconferenc system   it work veri well at the dalla meet   whi don   t we do videoconferenc fomc call   is there a reason at the moment whi we wouldn   t
i don   t know the answer to that  mr  chairman   i suspect it   s relat to the fact that the tape record equip is in this room   but that is someth that we can address
i ventur to say that there   s a solut to that   we are approach the bewitch hour  and to make sure that michell   not tell a falsehood about when our meet end  we   re go to have to bring this session to a close   regrett  i have on my list five peopl who want to speak and were not abl to do so   but if there is a next meet on this  the five of you will get prioriti even if you   ve forgotten what you want to say   i   ll give the list to the secretari   with that  the meet is adjourn  end of meet
