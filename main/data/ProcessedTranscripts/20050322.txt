thank you  mr  chairman   at the committe   s last meet i character market in the preced week as    more of the same     inasmuch as trend  such as the gradual rise of short term interest rate  a flatten yield curv  narrow credit spread  and low volatil  were continu their well establish pattern   in the past six week  some of those trend ceas  though it is too soon to declar that they have gone into revers   question about the pace of tighten and prospect for inflat in the medium term becam a more promin sourc of concern among investor   the top panel on page   of your handout graph eurodollar deposit contract matur in june       decemb       and june        what had been a steadi rise in futur rate acceler after the chairman   s semiannu monetari polici tes oni  especi for contract beyond the front month   the spread between the june       and june       contract widen to reflect this more aggress expect path of tighten   and while some trader ran to their dictionari to look up the mean of    conundrum     perhap the more import event with regard to the tes oni was the expect among mani market particip that the chairman would use the occas to signal a paus in tighten or to elucid the factor that could lead to a paus   receiv no clarif on either point  the market push out the length of the tighten cycl and  at  e  even the pace   with both anecdot comment and some fed fund futur reflect a stronger sens that the committe might at some point ratchet up the pace of tighten to    basi point   yield move higher at both the short and long end of the curv   as shown in the middl left panel  the two year treasuri yield  which had been tread water earlier in the tighten cycl  increas about    basi point   thus widen the spread to the target fund rate   as shown in the middl right panel     year yield rose from rough      percent at the  e of the februari meet to more than     percent today   besid revis expect of polici and increas worri about inflat  there were also period bout of anxieti about foreign central bank action to diversifi away from dollar and or treasuri secur   the    year yield is now back to rough the level it was last summer when the tighten cycl began       the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix            until the last few week  the combin of a gentl rise in short term rate and an immov    year yield had substanti flatten the yield curv   the recent price move did not revers that trend but did  as shown in the bottom panel  stabil the shape of the curv  which stop flatten at about    basi point   the last few week also featur an increas preoccup among trader and investor with the prospect for inflat   sever inflat report were higher than expect  and commod price continu to rise   for exampl  the top panel of page   show the crb  commod research bureau  index sinc januari        unlik other popular commod index  the crb   not have a larg energi compon and was more contain dure        the

at the end of that two year horizon  oil was trade below       the blue line graph the wti curv as of this past friday   the front month contract was trade at about      but the curv has onli a small

are lot of caveat one need to consid when interpret breakeven rate  other market base measur of inflationari expect are tame   for exampl  the five year breakeven five year ahead has remain in a narrow rang  as shown by the red line  and  in fact  is veri littl chang from a year ago   one question that has occupi market particip is whether risk is be mispric   the narrow of spread over the past two year and the fall of volatil suggest that investor have been in risk seek mode   in the intermeet period  that trend did not revers  though it did moder somewhat   the top left panel on page   show the invest grade corpor spread sinc mid year       in the top right is the high yield spread   both have narrow substanti in the last year or two   at it lowest level in the period  the high

treasuri yield and some       specif corpor event   though sudden  the recent widen was modest compar to other widen episod dure the last two year and relat to the previous narrow episod   of cours  the widen did not affect all issuer equal   the bottom left panel graph the spread of invest grade issuer by credit rate   the aa  a  and bbb sector are all narrow than they were a year ago  but in

posit in both currenc and equiti   but  to date  the retrac has been mild and repres onli a fraction of the appreci observ in previous month   in short  if this is the begin of a more general unwind  there is far more to go   i should also note that the dollar has been firmer against the euro and other major currenc the past few day  which may suggest a bit of risk avers  as the possibl of a more

trend is confront a bit more headwind at these veri low level  especi if the inflat and monetari polici outlook chang meaning in come week         mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in the intermeet period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper   bob and i will be happi to take ani question about market or about the memo i circul last week regard some chang we are plan to make to the yen reserv portfolio
go over again what is in the crb index   this is the spot index    what   s in there
yes   oil is a littl less than a quarter of that index
that   s a big number
yes  it   s about    percent  but that compar to about two third or three quarter weight that energi has in the goldman sach and the dow jone   aig index  for exampl   the other compon are
what els is in there
soft     as they are call   thing like agricultur commod and metal
agricultur commod   but grain price have come down in the most recent data   i assum iron ore is in there
i don   t know if iron ore is in there but copper is  copper scrap is in there  i think
that couldn   t have done that much   steel  for exampl  is actual down
i don   t think steel is in the crb
it   s a veri unusu index   the reason i rais the issu is becaus it  sn   t look like ani commod index i   m use to watch   unless oil is a veri big compon   do we know that   we can factor out the oil part of this
the biggest contributor to it movement has been oil  but all of the other    compon also had increas   so they all contribut to it  wherea  in the earlier period  when oil was rise some of the other compon actual were declin   so it   s a mixtur of effect
but if you take it as a meaning index  that   s a veri impress move   and the point is that it   s the first  e i   ve seen anyth like that in the commod area   i   ve alway look at the crb futur  which   look someth like this  but i assum it was a third order matter   anyway  enough of that
mr  chairman  i just want to note that the index  i think  is simpli an equal weight of all the various contract that are trade   it make no attempt at weight
there   s no weight
then how   oil get to be    percent
becaus there are a number of differ contract that are trade
it take all of them and they   re unweight
it   s an unweight index
there is no econom content weight
so wool top have the same weight implicit in the index as  say  a contract on gasolin or copper
so you have sever gasolin contract
and each is includ   so it   s not a terribl rigor
could you just take a look at that and let us know what is involv
it is the case  howev  mr  chairman  that there has been a broad    base upward movement in commod price in the last four week   so
yes  iron ore is up over    percent   copper is up and aluminum is up  steel is not
steel is not   steel is the princip one that hasn   t move up
and the weight of steel is much larger than copper and aluminum combin   so it   s an odd sort of commod index
there   s a definit of these index in a footnot in part   of the  book on page
that   s the chart i rememb   thank you   other question  would someon like to move approv of the desk   s transact
without object  they are approv   let   s turn now to dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   by virtual all measur  the economi has been hum along at a veri solid pace in recent month   we are es  that real gdp expand at a    percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year and is like to grow at about that pace in the first quarter of this year   the contributor to the expans have remain much the same   the household sector has  to date  shown no sign of flag   consum spend has been move up smart  and hous activ continu to be veri strong   meanwhil  equip spend by busi remain on a steep uptrend   and we have even seen some  sign of improv in nonresidenti construct  though most of that improv has been center in the upsw in drill activ that has accompani the jump in energi price   inventori invest and hire   the last major area in which we could detect the cautious busi behavior that had been such a promin featur of this episod   now appear to be trace more normal cyclic pattern         although the pace of the expans in real activ is much the same as that of a year ago  the charact of the expans now feel differ   while i can easili imagin look back on these word with regret  laughter   the persist and widespread improv that we are now wit certain leav the impress that the expans is more firm establish and less fragil with respect to advers shock than it was in earli        as you know from read the  book  we think that the recent greater momentum in real gdp will carri forward for a while   that greater momentum in activ and heighten upward pressur on inflat led us to rais the assum path of the feder fund rate by    basi point beyond the veri near term   as in past forecast  tighter monetari polici  diminish impetus from rise equiti valu and hous price  and fade fiscal s ulus are expect to gradual put a brake on the pace of activ   in our project  the economi reach the end of next year with the fund rate in the neighborhood of neutral  output close to potenti  and core inflat run around     percent   were it to occur  such an outcom would be veri pleasant inde   of cours  we know that our point forecast  like ani point forecast  will occur with probabl zero   so what should we worri about   while my colleagu who  attend our lengthi forecast meet were not exact thrill by it  the remov of my  arm from it sling in the past few week has allow me  onc again  to bring my princip valu ad to the forecast process  and that is copious amount of hand wring    laughter   in the remaind of my remark  i=d like to focus on three difficult question with which we had to wrestl in assembl this forecast  first  what should we make of  the recent strength in capit spend and what are it implic for the outlook  second  how should we balanc some power crosscurr at work on the suppli  side of the economi   and third  what is happen with inflat   i=ll take them each in turn  although there are some common thread that tie them togeth   let me begin with the chang that we have made to the project for equip spend   our last hope for evid support the partial expens pothol in the first quarter of this year larg evapor with the januari data   domest shipment of capit equip were up across the board  and import of capit good were strong as well   likewis  new book for capit equip rose at a brisk pace earli this quarter  and the backlog of unfil order has continu to mount   to be sure  we are project some deceler in e s spend in the first quarter  but most of that deceler reflect a drop in purchas of light motor vehicl  and we don=t see the expir of the tax incent as the major factor here  inde  much of the upward revis to our project of capit outlay in the first quarter has occur among long live asset   the type of capit equip that we thought would have been weakest earli this year         so  littl remain of our eleg stori   our calibr vintag capit model fail us  and clear finger cross has not proven a terribl robust forecast techniqu   we even tri an approach gentl suggest to us by governor olson at  the  e of our last forecast   you know  had we thought about tri common sens   laughter   we tri  but even that didn=t seem to work   in a convers with our colleagu at treasuri that they ask remain confidenti  they indic have been surpris that an appreci number of firm with taxabl incom have simpli not taken advantag of partial expens   moreov  some firm have taken it for purchas of longer live asset  but not for shorter live asset   this pattern of behavior might suggest that administr complex may have loom larger as a discourag factor than we or other imagin   but the fact are like to remain obscur for a long  e  while the ir tabul the corpor incom tax form for recent year   for now  we=r rais the white flag of surrend and chalk it up as a defeat for model  luck  and logic   i wouldn=t drag you through this discuss if it were just a sideshow in the forecast   but the chang that we made here were of polici signific   we revis up the growth in real equip spend by    percentag point in the current quarter  from a declin of   percent at an annual rate to an increas of   percent  moreov  we had previous interpret some of last year= strength in capit spend as result from firm pull forward outlay to take advantag of the tax break   if that was not the case  then under demand was like stronger than we had previous recogn   as a consequ  we are project some of that addit strength to carri over into the first half of this year   after account for follow on multipli   acceler effect  the revis to our forecast of equip spend boost growth of real gdp by near   percentag point this year and by   percentag point next year   these adjust more than offset the downward revis to our project that were necessit by the higher expect path of oil price  which we es  will trim about   percentag point off the growth in real gdp in each of the next two year   the fa  pace of capit spend incorpor in this project also had implic for aggreg suppli through it contribut to capit deepen   but that was just one of a number of chang we made on the suppli side of our project   as i note earlier  we have had to contend with two strong crosscurr in this aspect of our forecast  fa  than expect growth of labor product  on the one hand  and slower than expect growth of the labor forc  on the other   with regard to product  we appear to be start this year with anoth larg upsid surpris   our es  of the growth of output per hour in the first quarter has been revis up by   percentag point sinc the last  book to a     percent annual pace         as you know  the surpris strength of product over the past few year has requir us to take a stand on how much of the recent gain has reflect structur improv that will persist go forward and how much has reflect the cautious hire stanc of busi and their abil  at least for a  e  to elicit greater effort from their workforc   in other word  we have had to pars these innov into trend and cycl compon   with posit surpris to product continu  the stori about caution induc effort seem to us to have diminish plausibl   both our model and our best judgment suggest rais our es  of the structur compon of product in recent year and correspond lower the cyclic compon   in addit to rais the level of structur product through the end of last year  we also nudg up our es  of the growth of structur product go forward by about   percentag point per year to about   percent per annum   about half of that upward revis reflect the larger contribut from capit deepen that follow from our stronger invest forecast   the other half reflect stronger project growth of multifactor product   busi have been make substanti gain in technolog and organiz effici in recent year  and we anticip more of that to continu over the next coupl of year than was assum in our januari project   while the revis that we have made to structur product  all els equal  would have result in a notic upward revis to the project growth of potenti output  all els was not equal   just as we have been surpris to the upsid by product  we have been consist surpris to the downsid over the past year or so by the weak in labor forc particip   we had been expect that  as the labor market began to give clearer sign of sustain improv  more worker would be drawn back into the labor forc   we still think that is like to happen   but the grow tension between our expect of an immin upturn in labor forc particip and the realiti of it ongo declin prompt us to overhaul our model in this area  disaggreg age  sex  and cohort effort at a much more detail level than we had done in the past   the upshot of that work has been to suggest that more   though certain not all   of the declin that we have observ in particip over the past few year has been demograph and less has been cyclic than we had earlier thought   at the risk of oversimplifi some complic interact  wherea we had earlier thought a continu uptrend in women= particip would about offset the ongo declin in the particip rate of men  we now think that women= particip may be flatten out even as men= particip continu to declin   all told  we es  a more notic downward tilt to aggreg trend particip  and thus potenti labor input is more limit than we had previous project         on net  the upward revis to product slight exceed the downward revis to potenti labor input  and we revis up the growth of potenti output by     percentag point this year and next   these upward revis were smaller than those we made to actual gdp  and  as a consequ  the gdp gap is a touch smaller in come quarter than was the case in our januari project   a slight tighter economi has ad to a grow list of worri that would make ani compuls hand wringer proud   that list would also contain higher oil price  larger increas in non oil import price  a steep rise in commod price  a reemerg of price pressur from intermedi materi  some deterior in near term inflat expect  and a disappoint larg increas in core pce  person consumpt expenditur  price in januari   to our relief  this morning= ppi for februari did not add to this list   the increas in core finish good   at     percent   and the increas in core intermedi materi   at     percent   were right in line with the  book project   but taken togeth  price develop over the intermeet period have been troubl   the effect of higher oil price are alreadi be felt at the pump  and headlin inflat measur will be up notic in februari and march   moreov  higher energi and materi price are ad to busi cost  and higher price for import are lessen competit pressur on the price decis of domest produc   in respons to these develop  we have rais the project increas in core pce price to    percent in      and     percent in        about   percentag point higher than our previous project in both year   still  the basic contour of the inflat forecast remain the same   such a modest revis might lead some to wonder if the staff should be do a littl more hand wring if we wish to avoid an eventu neck wring   but at this point  we believ that onli a modest revis is warrant   as you know  for the price of oil and other commod  we take our cue from futur market   and  as they have for much of the past year  those market are suggest that a flatten out of price is just around the corner and that declin will occur by next year   futur market have not proven to be terribl reliabl guid to price over the past year  but we simpli aren=t confid that we can outguess the market in these area   we view the larger increas in core pce of late as suggest that the size  pass through  and persist of price pressur from energi  import  and other commod has been greater than we had earlier expect   but we do not think that we are  as yet  experienc a broad base upward push on inflat   one piec of evid in support of that interpret is that all of the acceler in core pce price over the past year has occur among core good  where the influenc of energi  materi  and import is like to be largest   core servic have actual deceler         moreov  the labor cost pictur remain quit subdu   growth in hour labor compens has basic move sideway in recent quarter   our project incorpor some acceler in wage inflat in respons to higher price inflat this year and a gradual tighten of the labor market   but the fa  project growth of actual and structur labor product hold down the overal increas in unit labor cost   inde  the combin of slight higher price inflat and lower unit labor cost result in an upward revis to the price markup in this project  which alreadi was abov histor norm   in effect  greater price power is implicit in this forecast   as i see it  the most disquiet develop on the inflat front has not been the run up in energi and commod price  but has been the appar rise in inflat compens over the next three year   at least as best as we can judg by read from the inflat swap market   should a deterior in inflat expect eventu come to be reflect in wage  and price set decis  you would be face a more substanti  persist  and ul  cost acceler of labor cost and price   as we show in an altern simul in the  book  those difficulti are amplifi if monetari polici is slow to respond to heighten inflat expect  and real interest rate are inadvert eas   on the other hand  the most comfort develop on the inflat front has been the continu except perform of product   although we have revis up our forecast for actual and structur product  we are still bet on a substanti slowdown of structur multifactor product   as we show in anoth simul  if that  sn   t occur  cost pressur could be consider less than we are current anticip and inflat could drop to the low end of your comfort zone     will continu our present
one of the most import chang made to the forecast in this  book relat to that of januari is the increas in the project path for oil price   that increas reflect develop in global oil market over the intermeet period   sinc late last week  spot wti oil price have been at new high  over     per barrel  a bit abov the peak price reach last octob   but there are some signific differ between market condit then and current one  last octob  the spike in rate was particular sharp for the light  sweet crude such as wti and was  in part  a transitori respons to the impact of hurrican ivan on suppli in the gulf of mexico   this  e the rise in price is more general   the price of dubai  a heavier  more sour crude  has risen near     per barrel abov it level last octob  result in a  spread between the price for wti and dubai of about    per barrel rather than the     record last octob      in addit  the far futur price is now more than     per barrel  over     per barrel higher than in octob  suggest that market expect price to be elev for some  e         no one factor explain the run up in price sinc late januari  but a major reason seem to be stronger demand in global market   current and prospect  in the eye of market particip   this stronger demand is aris from a global economi in which continu expans at a reason robust pace seem like  albeit with some variat across region   also  there are current some suppli risk in the usual troubl spot among oil produc countri   but over the longer run  the issu seem to be how project increas in demand will be met by increas suppli   of the     million barrel per day that global consumpt increas dure          percent  or         barrel per day  was account for by increas consumpt in china   china is now the second largest oil consum on the globe  the unit state is first   the staff continu to reli on futur market for our project of the spot wti price   after the first coupl of month  the futur curv slope down and is the basi of our forecast that  by the end of       that price will be somewhat below today= price   howev  we also need to forecast the u s  oil import price  and for us the challeng is to project the spread go forward between wti and the import price  that spread was quit variabl last year  and in januari of this year it jump up again  to over    per barrel   we current expect that the spread will narrow  on balanc  over the forecast period  with the result that the u s  price for import oil will declin onli slight from current level   notic less than the decreas embed in the futur curv for wti   by the end of next year   howev  we could be surpris  and the behavior of that spread is one of the risk to the forecast   the general increas in global oil price has been cite by mani as a reason for rise inflat expect and the move up in long term interest rate across the major industri countri dure the intermeet period   ten year sovereign rate in the major foreign industri countri general rose about    basi point sinc your last meet  somewhat less than the increas in the u s  rate   the smaller rebound in rate abroad is consist with the percept that recent econom indic suggest a more vigor pace of expans in the u s  economi than in the other industri economi   and foreign rate declin more sharpli than did u s  rate from the end of last june  when you began your current tighten cycl  to the turn point for rate in earli februari   howev  it may be that the stronger price perform of bond denomin in  the major foreign currenc reflect some shift in portfolio prefer away from dollar asset toward those denomin in the other major currenc   such an interpret is consist with the   percent net nomin depreci of the foreign exchang valu of the dollar in term of the other major currenc over the intermeet period and the fact that stock market index in the foreign industri countri general outperform u s  index over the same interv   data for the u s  current account balanc in the fourth quarter were releas last week and report in the  book supplement   at an annual rate  the deficit       widen near     billion from the third quarter figur  with about     billion of that chang account for by the increas in the trade deficit   of that     billion  more than half repres the deterior in the oil import bill   relat to the figur we put in the  book  net invest incom surpris us in the posit direct   that surpris was entir in net direct invest receipt  as net portfolio incom came in about as expect  around     billion weaker than in the third quarter   direct invest receipt were particular strong  with the increas more than offset a small posit surpris in direct invest payment   the fourth quarter increment in the current account deficit was financ by somewhat larger foreign offici financi inflow and substanti larger foreign privat net purchas of u s  secur  particular of agenc bond and corpor stock   the rise in foreign inflow was suffici to financ a small rise in u s  net privat acquisit of foreign secur and an unusu but sizabl increas from the third quarter of u s  direct invest abroad   look forward  we expect the trade deficit to widen further both this year and next   with littl chang project in the u s  oil import price  the oil import bill should increas onli slight  and most of the deterior in the trade balanc is expect to occur within the core good categori   that is  good less oil  comput  and semiconductor   accord  in real term we are look for net export to make a small negat contribut to gdp growth in each of the two year   we expect the widen of the nomin trade deficit to be near match by further reduct in the net invest incom balanc  as the negat chang to net portfolio incom substanti outweigh project gain in net direct invest incom   accord  the current account deficit should widen to exceed      billion  or     percent of gdp  by the end of next year   we also receiv februari price of intern trade good late last week  price for non oil core import increas a bit more than we were expect  februari price rise were concentr in food  feed  and beverag and in non oil industri suppli  but for januari and februari combin  all categori of non oil  core good other than auto regist signific upward move   these develop leav us with a project for inflat of the core import price deflat in the first quarter of near   percent at an annual rate  higher than the januari   book figur and higher than our equat by themselv would suggest   we do not yet have suffici evid to conclud that the declin observ in past exchang rate pass through is be revers   with the effect of dollar depreci in the second half of last year and the recent run up in commod price like to be felt through the end of this year  we expect core import price inflat to be about   percent at an annual rate dure the rest of this year befor slow notic next year  consist with our outlook for flat commod price and onli modest further dollar depreci     and i will be happi to answer ani question
there has been consider discuss     as you know better than i  about the failur of firm to capit a lot of what is current expens  especi in conjunct with the instal of a lot of high tech capit equip   is there  ani way of look at the data to see to what extent  if at all  they correl with multifactor product as current es
well  we have not undertaken a calcul like that  mr  chairman  and it strike me that it would be relat complic to construct   but we could certain take a look at it   from our perspect   and this is one of the reason we are give for the improv in multifactor product   invest in inform technolog is a general purpos technolog   so  beyond just the improv in the product of inform technolog equip  we are now see more sign of widespread applic of inform technolog   and the organiz effici that it has allow have been a factor in keep multifactor product elev   that   s one of the reason we   re still reason op ist about this   while the growth rate will not continu at the pace record in the past few year  we think it   s go to remain at a pace that is abov averag by histor standard
well  one would expect to be abl to pick it up from the capit expenditur for high tech equip  on the presumpt that the amount of expens item would be somehow relat to that   but you alreadi do that implicit in creat a capit servic measur  and it would theoret just show up in the coeffici on the capit servic measur   so could one assum that mayb it   s alreadi in there in that respect
when you say    alreadi in there
mean  in other word  it   s alreadi be captur to some extent   but that can   t be  becaus that   s not the way those number are put togeth   the       question i   m realli ask is this  is there a correl between outlay on capit expenditur for high tech equip and what we now measur as multifactor product
i don   t know the precis answer to that question   i   m not sure if   olin  who is our expert on this  would have ani thought on the subject
mr  chairman  i think on a year by year basi the correl is go to be loos at best   when we look back over the second half of the      s  we had a lot of capit deepen in high tech equip  which direct contribut to labor product growth   it   s true that multifactor product pick up and was strong
but theoret  if multifactor product were zero  you would be captur all of the impact of capit invest on measur product
so  to the extent that there   s a gap  it   s unexplain   i vagu recal what you are say     name  that multifactor product   expand  and  inde  it has start to expand again now
that suggest not a close correl  obvious  but some relationship   so there may be someth to this proposit which  if true  may enabl you to improv your es    instead of guess at multifactor product  which has rang from     percent to   percent  you may be abl to narrow it down quit signific and actual have input data direct es  longer term product   if it work   i have no idea whether it work
it is possibl   what we   re realli talk about are the organiz    effici that are produc by high tech invest  which don   t necessarili occur contemporan with do that invest   it take some learn over  e
well  have a distribut lag    laughter   your imagin is without limit
may i get in on this one      didn   t your paper with dan sichel do that   i thought it did   i thought you had a littl routin within multifactor product to do exact what the chairman was suggest
not exact   what we did was to tri to quantifi the pickup in multifactor product growth from those industri that produc high tech equip or semiconductor and comput   that framework was import
it   s not the one that use the equip but the one that produc it
it   s the other way around   that   s interest   you still have the floor  governor
no  i just want to ask about that issu
i see   presid pool
you note the enorm role of china in rais energi demand worldwid   could you give me a sens of the energi demand in india   india is obvious a low incom countri  but it is now grow quit substanti   it   s a larg countri   in both part of the  book  there is onli a veri limit amount of inform on india   you do have data on korea and taiwan  and i   m wonder if we shouldn   t be ad to our store of knowledg       here in futur  book   i would think the absolut size of india would be suffici that you would want to start track india as well as korea and taiwan  and so forth
well  the answer to your first question is that i don   t know the energi demand of india   i don   t even think they are on my list   i have a tabl here list oil consumpt by countri  and i   m sure india is not on that list   but the fact that india is expand most in it servic produc sector  rather than it manufactur sector  make me think that that aspect of india   s growth is not drive energi consumpt particular   but  as standard of live rise in india  presum household and the like will start consum more   what i can say  though  is that we have recogn that india is sudden get to be more import  and we have up the staff coverag of india   we are go to put india more explicit into the forecast and will be cover that countri in more detail
good   thank you
could you give us a fair and balanc view     laughter    of the signific of the chang to the stabil and growth pact   on net  are they realli that bad   the market didn   t seem terribl worri about what they mean for fiscal polici go forward   there were some aspect of the revis agreement that might be regard as a tighten  which i don   t realli understand   what is your assess
well  i have not read it or thought about it in suffici detail to truli answer your question   my sens is that  in part  it was a recognit of the inevit   that is  it was a polit solut to the fact that certain realiti of life were confront sever european countri   so rather than continu with the polit tension at meet about who was go to       be penal and allow the stress between the larger countri and the smaller countri to keep play out in the media  they revis the agreement   they felt that if they chang the languag  they could accept what was go to happen in ani event and reduc the damag it might caus  becaus countri would be compli in some sens with the revis stabil and growth pact rather than the old one  as for the actual detail of the chang  they larg took the form of redefin what goe into the measur against which target are set and against which penalti are levi for violat the target   to be honest  i don   t have the list complet in my head  but one chang had to do with german reunif   for exampl  certain expenditur get put in a differ categori and are not part of the relev measur of the budget deficit against which they are suppos to meet the target
that in itself is enough to bring the german deficit well down
other kind of restructur expenditur were includ   so there was an effort made to
the labor reform expenditur were also allow to be taken out
yes  the pension reform
in addit to sort of recogn the inevit  such as the german reunif piec  mani of the other categori that were accord new status i would describ as thing that everybodi agre should be done   they agre that it would be regrett if  in the name of the stabil and growth pact  polit pressur were exert to cut back on       restructur so as to meet the goal   now  we all know the stabil and growth pact was intend to tell these countri that they should cut other thing so they could achiev the target  but that wasn   t happen   the ecb  european central bank  made a guard statement about remain concern   the market didn   t seem to react negat   down deep the problem  in my mind  is that the way the stabil and growth pact was origin structur   and possibl even the way it is still structur   was appropri for countri that had alreadi re center their fiscal activ more or less at a zero balanc   the various way that the limit were state and the symmetri  and so forth  all assum each countri start from a good place   and then it made perfect sens   actual  if that had been the case  one would be indiffer to whether it should be the structur adjust balanc or the actual balanc  that is irrelev if you   re start at zero   some of the big countri never got there  and that has been the part of the stori that has produc tension ever sinc       realli   these reform didn   t undo that   they didn   t say  we wrote a pact center on zero and that isn   t work  so we   re go to scrap that and start all over   but they did make these except  which are go to eas the pressur on some of the big countri   so  those countri will not be forc  in a macroeconom sens  to tighten when it   s not such a good idea  nor will pressur be put on them not to do some structur thing that they should be do  becaus those specif are the thing that have been exempt
but they didn   t accommod greater cyclic diverg on their path
it realli is accommod structur chang that go    in the wrong direct to the object even if those chang otherwis make some sens
right   but by set asid a class of expenditur that are go to happen  they have allow the band  as defin  to embrac the countri   so the fact that they didn   t chang the cyclic thing  sn   t matter so much anymor
paygo   not appli    laughter
that   s correct
the basic purpos was to get them beyond the elect  the presumpt that everyth is go to be fine beyond the elect has no basi  becaus the next set of pressur will creat differ effect   what it demonstr is that the general view that the system would hold togeth and work for the big countri is flaw   it work for the small countri  becaus the big countri insist  they essenti have the capac to give the smaller countri an either or ul atum  so to speak   with luxembourg in the chair   and they were veri strong against ani chang   it took a coupl of month to erod a lot of that languag and final get everybodi on board  which tell you that this is a veri flaw system
yes   but it seem to me what is flaw is not so much the stabil and growth pact as the lisbon agenda   despit the rhetor  the major countri in europ have not taken step to deregul themselv  to becom more effici and more dynam  and to do all the thing that they pledg to do in lisbon   had they done those thing  the old stabil and growth pact would have probabl been just fine   it   s not obvious to me that the chang they agre to just recent are go to move us veri far in the direct of the lisbon agenda   but these chang will at least elimin the       uncertainti that has been out there in the market about whether these countri will actual be contract fiscal polici at a  e when unemploy is rise  and that kind of thing
they   re probabl go to tri to implement a new version of the lisbon agenda
yes   and  at some level  schroeder   s initi have been appropri and the right thing to do   but certain there   s not a broad consensus among the european popul to go in that direct
mr  chairman  if i could just add a point on the market effect   as some of you know  greec issu a    year bond recent at    basi point abov the rate on bund  or about    point below the u s     year rate and about     basi point below the    year rate
can we borrow from the greek    laughter
it   s interest  sinc they are at about doubl the   percent limit   so the market are not punish anybodi for not compli
this is probabl go on a littl long  but i   ll ask one quick question  i see that you have gone from a negat contribut to growth in the first quarter from  equip spend to a posit one   but in term of the growth rate for the first quarter  you end up with a project that   s on the order of    percentag point under the growth rate predict elsewher in the blue chip and the wall street forecast  and so forth   i know you   ve probabl done some hand wring about that   ani thought
the most signific compon of the slowdown that we   re project  as i indic  is a substanti drop in purchas of light motor vehicl   we   re basic tri to mimic the bea  bureau of econom analysi  in term of calcul the       share of light motor vehicl sale go to the busi sector versus the household side  there is a big swing in that share
so  do you think these other forecast are not incorpor that
well  i   m not quit sure   i don   t want to impugn them that way   we  could be wrong  obvious  about that compon   the nontransport compon we have onli a bit slower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year   so at this stage  we are just do our best straightforward read of the incom data   we are not impos ani addit add factor or restraint on the assumpt that the partial expens is push thing down   that said  this is a veri volatil area of the forecast and one in which we have made big error   and i assum other have as well
i   ll pass

dave  i   m interest in your work on labor forc particip   we   ve been look at that a bit  too   can you give me a sens of what   s drive the new forecast of a  level off in labor forc particip rate of women
as i indic  one of the refin that we undertook in this model effort was that  in addit to track age and sex  we tri to look more care at cohort effect   basic  what we are now see is that the particip rate of women come into the work age popul relat to the particip of those exit it are not as differ as they were in year past   in earlier year the particip of women enter the labor forc was so much higher than those who were leav that it was drive an aggreg increas   and now  look at that more care  the differ is less pronounc than it had       been in the past   so our forecast for the particip rate of women is a littl flatter  go forward

thank you  mr  chairman   activ continu to firm in the seventh district   in general  my contact are more upbeat than they were a coupl of month ago  and there is much more confid that the expans is on a solid  self sustain foot   and we   re hear more news about price increas and price pressur   nevertheless  activ has not yet heat up to the point that there is broad base pressur on capac   the posit news is fair widespread  demand continu to be robust for heavi truck and for equip use in construct  agricultur  and oil and gas industri   our contact in retail trade  includ shop mall oper  and in consum advertis also tell us that busi is good  the news on hire  howev  is more subdu   notabl  the two major temporari help firm headquart in our district report that their growth has slow sinc our last meet  also  there is an import downsid risk for our district   s economi   the well public woe of general motor and ford could develop into an even larger drag than we have seen to date   it   s not clear how the auto market will evolv in        year to date sale have been weak  as automak appear to be test the market with lower incent   still  the big three have not yet back off  their earlier project that light vehicl sale will run about     million unit this year   they are hope that sale will increas as the year proceed  similar to the pattern in      after they rais incent   but base on our convers  it is unclear whether the automak will be will to do the same this year      given the increas momentum in the district economi  we took a hard look at resourc    constraint and price pressur   heavi vehicl product continu to be constrain by shortag of engin  axl  and especi tire   and caterpillar expect product to be strain capac at least through        on the price front  the environ has clear chang   for exampl  the head of a larg bank told me that  for the first  e in mani year  supplier are tell custom to buy now or pay higher price in    day   manufactur    long term contract for materi are run out  and sever report pay premium in order to ensur suppli and keep product run at full tilt  as more of these long term contract expir  cost pressur and pass through could intensifi   even auto supplier are dig in their heel and resist further price reduct   in contrast  the steel price pictur look better  as you mention earlier   as one contact note  this is perhap due in part to increas product in china   also  on the intern scene  a major retail told us that his european supplier recent boost price between   and    percent after hold the line last year   in respons  the retail shift some busi to supplier in the far east   turn to the nation economi  it   s clear that growth is on firm  self sustain ground   so our focus should shift more to assess inflationari pressur  and there are indic that inflat risk may have increas   recent price data and  as i just mention  comment from our busi contact  do have a firmer tone   oil price continu to surpris us on the upsid  the declin dollar is show through to higher import price  tip measur of inflat compens have move up  and resourc slack could be smaller than we thought   in particular  work done by our bank   s economist   and by the board staff  as dave discuss   suggest that labor forc particip rate may settl out at a lower level than we had been think      these develop have increas our inflat forecast  but quantifi the extent of the    inflat risk is difficult   when we run our model use data back to the     s  the model forecast higher pce inflat   near   percent this year and next year   but the economi has chang a lot  particular start in the earli     s   when we limit the data to the last    year  the uptick is diminish   furthermor  i do not get the impress that a     s type inflationari mental is creep into my contact    decisionmak process   so  on balanc  take everyth into consider  i think we can continu our pattern of measur rate increas  and i don   t think we need major chang in the word of our statement at this meet   futur market expect us to move the fund rate to    percent by year end   but if a more aggress tighten is warrant  we could easili get to    percent just by increas the fund rate    basi point at each meet   this would be perfect consist with our    measur pace    languag   but we may need to move more aggress after this meet  some warn cloud have clear develop   we often say we need to be data depend   i think it   s particular import now   we   ll get two month of price data befor our may meet and  of cours  a lot of other data   and we   ll want to look care at those data in assess our next step
mr  chairman  look at the economi  we expect growth will be in line with what other have said   in the   percent rang this year and slight abov     percent next year   with trend growth of about    percent  obvious the output gap and labor market slack are diminish   there are a whole host of reason for that  which dave alreadi outlin  and i won   t repeat them    i will say that from the tenth district perspect  our inform support this more robust outlook   most retail we contact said that sale were up from last year   s alreadi solid level   in     addit  travel and tourism continu to improv  as the dollar has help to increas ski visit and   hotel occup in the mountain state   labor market remain strong  with hire announc exceed layoff by about a    to   ratio sinc our previous fomc meet   and  final  district manufactur continu to expand strong   product  new order  and employ all rose in februari   moreov  firm remain op ist about futur activ and plan moder increas in employ and capit spend go forward this year   i   ll make most of my comment on the inflat outlook  becaus i do have some concern about that   i was struck by     s point that  as for inflat break out  he would put it in term of a    not yet    statement   but as i view the outlook  i expect  even with the fed fund rate rise as we current are project  that inflat will increas and perhap could acceler in      and       here are some reason for that   first  we have been in an accommod mode of polici for an extend period of  e now   year  not quarter   with the fed fund rate below most es  of neutral over much of that period   core inflat  by whatev measur you pick   core cpi or pce or the market base core pce   drift higher last year   not onli did core inflat drift higher  it was unexpect higher than earlier project   this unexpect increas is notabl becaus it occur even though real gdp growth was as expect and the fed fund rate was be increas   if inflat could increas that much last year in the presenc of sizabl slack and a rise fed fund rate  i am concern that  with less slack in the economi this year  we will end up with yet higher inflat   in addit  a number of indic suggest continu inflationari pressur   for exampl  we have higher cost pressur result from higher commod price  which we mention  and from oil price and the lower dollar   as a result  we also are see high ppi inflat and increas     in unit labor cost that may not be dramat yet  but they are increas   wage pressur are   emerg in our district   about a quarter of the employ we contact said that they   ve had to rais wage more than normal  particular for skill worker   we are also see evid of increas price power in the tenth district  as firm have more confid in their abil to rais output price even without an increas in input cost   for exampl  we ask our survey particip a special question about whether their abil to rais price had improv sinc the begin of just this year   of    respons  more than half said clear yes   the final reason i see an upsid risk for inflat is that monetari polici    in fact  remain accommod   the feder fund rate is current below most es  of the neutral rate   even with the  book   s assumpt of tighter polici  the fed fund rate will end the year below or at the lower end of es  of the medium run neutral rate   this pose a signific upsid risk to inflat  becaus it is like that much of the slack in the economi will have been elimin by the end of the year   with output close to potenti and core inflat elev  i think we should aim to be comfort within the rang of neutral by the end of the year  not at the lower end   overal  with growth abov trend  i am concern that there is an upsid risk to inflat even with the fund rate path consist with the project we are see current   i believ we should begin move more aggress to bring the fed fund rate closer to the long run neutral rate sooner   i would submit that  as long as the fund rate remain signific below neutral  the risk that we will need to rais it    basi point can be manag   now  i say that  but i also realiz that a    basi point increas  while it could be justifi  would surpris financi market   so perhap we should begin to signal the market that a more aggress return to neutral is at least possibl   but rather than tinker with the languag in the press announc  which make me nervous  i would     prefer to shorten it and drop ani refer to measur pace   after read the minut in three   week  market will know that a more aggress polici is possibl   in other word  we don   t have to provid a long explan today   and in fact  in tes oni you gave earlier  i think you drop the    measur    languag  therefor  i don   t think chang that part of the statement would surpris the market at all   thank

thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in the outlook for the third district sinc my last report   econom activ continu to expand at a moder pace in most sector in the region  and most of our busi contact expect the current pace of activ to be maintain through the spring   recent read from our busi outlook survey indic that region manufactur activ is expand   the pace is slower than we saw dure the initi phase in this sector in late          and earli       but that is to be expect   in march  the general activ index fell to       a   fair sharp declin from last month   s read of near      i don   t read too much into this   the  index has been fair volatil over the past three month  but it remain at a level that is typic of expans   consum continu to spend at a moder pace   winter merchandis has been clear out through discount  and spring apparel is sell well   most of our retail contact have said that sale are run close to plan   as was true last month  nonresidenti construct in our region remain soft   howev  offic leas activ in the philadelphia metropolitan area has begun to rise  with five consecut quarter of posit absorpt   vacanc rate have improv slight   residenti construct has remain healthi  but it   s down from it peak last spring   and hous price acceler continu  but at a slower pace than earlier last year   employ is increas in the region  but our director and our other busi contact continu to report on the scarciti of qualifi worker   some firm have resort to tri to bus peopl in from other local  with mix success   a temp agenc custom indic that they   ve had no object to recent wage increas  expect that they would help eas the labor shortag  but  so far  at least  this has not been the case   the manag for the temp agenc said that the like enact of a    increas over two year in the new jersey minimum wage to       per hour will have littl effect on her busi  as her worker alreadi earn more than that   howev  the new jersey depart of labor es  that    percent of hour worker earn less than       an hour   there is some evid that the price power of firm in the region is rise   the manufactur firm we survey report pay and receiv higher price   one manufactur     who recent put through a price increas to his custom said he now regret not have made a   larger increas  given the eas with which it was accept   in summari  the econom expans continu at a moder pace in the third district  labor market appear to be tighten  price pressur may be build  and the outlook among busi contact in our region remain posit   my assess of the econom condit in the nation has chang somewhat sinc we last met   the incom data and forecast seem to be indic that the under economi has more momentum than i thought a month ago   at that  e  i had character the economi as grow at a moder pace   i would now say it   s grow at a solid pace   we have transit from a consumpt led to an invest led expans   other than nonresidenti construct  no sector is show sign of weak despit higher oil price   in addit  the labor market has strengthen   payrol have risen at a     percent annual pace over the last    month   that   s less than the     percent annual rate we saw from the end of      to       but rememb that at the end of      the unemploy rate was     percent   with the unemploy rate now under     percent  the current pace of employ growth is probabl about right   we are at a point in the busi cycl at which we need to be veri watch about inflat dynam and inflat expect   in the middl of       the    month core inflat measur had fallen to around   percent and the committe embark upon a reflat polici   this polici was success   our action have increas the inflat rate to the midpoint of my accept rang  our job now is to set polici to ensur that inflat   not acceler beyond that accept rang   in my view  the sign of a pickup in under inflat and in inflat expect indic that the risk to inflat has shift to the upsid   there has been a relat sharp     acceler in core consum good price  oil price have risen substanti   as we heard this   morn   and the dollar has declin consider   all of this pose a real inflat risk go forward   more signific  medium term inflat expect  as measur by the spread between nomin and inflat index yield  appear to be shift upward   with forecast of inflat move up  albeit not yet to an alarm rate  it would behoov us to respond in some fashion   we all know that we cannot wait until we see a sustain acceler in inflat if we want to do someth about it  all this suggest that it is import for us to remain vigil about sign of higher inflat and to take step now to increas our flexibl in adjust the fund rate path go forward  inde  with the real fund rate still quit low and monetari polici accommod  i   m put more weight on the possibl that we will have to rais rate at a fa  pace than we anticip a month ago   it could veri well be that a measur pace  interpret by the market as move of    basi point  still character the most like path for polici go forward   but  in my view  the possibl that a steeper path may be need has risen sinc our last meet   if other on the committe feel as i do  then i think we need to find a way to convey this shift in prior to the public   one way to do that is to reword our statement to clear acknowledg the increas in inflat pressur   we can do this in the rational languag or in the assess of risk languag or both   anoth way is to acknowledg that a fa  pace may be necessari in order to fulfil our dual mandat   i   ll defer get into the specif of the languag until the next part of our discuss   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the fourth district have been    gradual improv across a broad rang of industri this year  and busi confid appear to be strengthen as well   actual  it feel good to no longer be a beig book outlier    laughter  as it turn out  i am also not a  book outlier   i find myself in broad agreement with the staff   s baselin project   i know i should feel comfort be in such good compani  but i view the project as the result of compet risk   both the  book and my busi contact are bring to my attent the posit associ with product growth and the negat associ with price increas   although the rate of structur product growth might slow somewhat over the next few year  in my view the declin in the  book multifactor product project seem a littl steep   the product growth surpris of the last coupl of year may persist a bit longer  busi execut that i talk to tell me that they are still veri focus on look for opportun to enhanc product and that their capit invest are design to achiev that goal   the drive for effici has becom even more pronounc for those compani that are grappl with larg increas in energi price and in the price of other raw materi   and  of cours  mani compani continu to experi larg increas in medic care cost  ad to the incent to wring out labor cost and other cost   the prospect that product growth may exceed the  book baselin give me some op  about the inflat outlook at a  e when the headlin inflat number keep escal  yet the factor drive the price level up do not seem to be go away   energi price  as we   ve comment  have ratchet up again   and  as multiyear contract with energi supplier roll off  mani compani continu to face increas in the price they have to pay   the same situat exist  although to a lesser degre  with retail price pressur induc by higher price of raw materi     and also intermedi product   in addit to these factor  there is also the possibl that past   dollar depreci could show up in the form of higher price of both import and domest product   the anecdot inform that i have been receiv about price has taken on a differ tone from last year   last year  retail like wal mart and home depot would not accept price increas from their supplier   but the dam seem to be show some crack   recent  i heard from the ceo of a global compani that suppli the big box retail with adhes product  such as duct tape   he told me that dure a recent meet with wal mart he explain that he was request a price increas   he was told that they weren   t accept ani price increas and that they would go to his competitor   three day later he receiv a call from wal mart say that they were go to purchas these suppli from him at the price increas he request becaus his competitor had also ask for a price increas  also  a larg manufactur of capit equip who suppli the adhes industri  among other  told me that he can get price increas for his equip even though his cost are not rise that dramat   but becaus the busi he is suppli are abl to pass on price increas  they are will to take a price increas from him   so it seem that  at least in this industri  it   s more than the adhes themselv that are begin to stick    laughter   all thing consid  i do think that the price environ over the next year or so will be veri challeng for compani   i see some evid that price pressur have been build  yet  if busi are success in maintain strong product growth  these pressur might be held in check   the  book illustr the tension between these two factor and  as i said  i can find myself be either hope or worri        i think our strategi of gradual remov our polici accommod has convinc the public that we are determin to keep inflat in check over the long term   it will be import for  us to earn that same degre of confid as we go forward and as resourc in the economi becom more intens util   although i   m concern that the possibl of inflat creep over the next year is there  the risk still seem balanc to me as long as we continu to remov our polici accommod at a measur pace and do so for the forese futur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in recent week  we have receiv evid of a continu in the slow growth in our district that we note in our beig book report   retail sale  which in the beig book were report as have level off  began declin in earli march by our indic   a slump in big ticket sale has evid drag down retail activ in recent week   district manufactur activ continu to expand but at a slower pace than in februari  our march diffus index  to be releas this morn  came in at about neutral  which is down a bit from februari   interest  hard ani of our textil and apparel industri contact are cite the surg in import from china as an import factor for them   their report on shipment trend are fair even split between expand and declin   we continu to receiv report of substanti higher raw materi price across an array of industri   the hous market remain quit strong in sever area in our district   concern over so call bubbl condit are widespread among our real estat contact  especi in northern virginia and in coastal area  although price seem to have top out in sever high end coastal communiti      in bank  the ceo of a communiti bank oper in north  ina and the we n    portion of virginia said busi is as strong as train smoke   not be veri familiar with train smoke  i ask him how strong a read that repres   he note about the onli thing stronger was batteri acid    laughter   turn to the nation pictur  the economi look notic stronger today than it did at the end of januari   the  book now es  that real gdp grew at     percent in the fourth quarter of last year  substanti higher than the previous es      percent   first quarter real gdp growth has been revis up substanti   expect futur real gdp growth is essenti unchang   and there is littl revis to the path of potenti output over the forecast period   the slowli improv labor market suggest that the output gap is still on track to continu diminish in the near futur   on the inflat front  unit labor cost continu to be well behav   the recent spurt in energi and import price has elev the overal index  but ani spillov into the core index seem like to abat   so i   d expect core pce inflat to return to near     percent after not too long   the  book forecast is condit on a path for the fed fund rate    basi point higher than in januari  a path that near match the market   s expect over the forecast horizon   all in all  i think this is a good outlook   in my view the most like risk is that inflat expect will be driven higher   by a more sustain increas in oil price  by a sharper depreci of the dollar  or by a more rapid close of the output gap than we expect   the most worrisom evid of rise inflat expect is the chang in market measur of near term inflat compens   for exampl  the tip five year inflat compens  which has been drift up fit over the past year or so  has increas by about a     third of a percentag point sinc the last fomc meet   we would expect larg oil price increas   to generat some movement in these compens measur base on anticip of pass through to consum energi price   so the recent increas in the five year tip spread may reflect mere a sort of expect arithmet pipelin of futur cpi increas   and  consist with this  chart   of the bluebook show that a substanti portion of the increas is attribut to the first year of the five year horizon and that compens for year four and five hasn   t move much   on the other hand  the bluebook also show that signific increas have occur over the intermeet period in forward inflat compens two and three year out  and these movement seem hard to ration base on the current pipelin effect alon   of cours  these expect pertain to the headlin cpi figur  which is go to be elev onli temporarili abov core inflat  i think   inde  the  book call for core cpi inflat to remain anchor at close to   percent  and that   s a project i   m quit comfort with  all this suggest that inflat expect  although they have been creep up  are not yet a problem   we   ll have to adapt our plan  howev  if inflat expect behav in a way that is inconsist with our intent   we can start by make sure that our behavior is not exacerb the problem   the public learn from the minut of our februari meet that we had defer specifi a quantit target rang for inflat   that left open the question of how much more inflat we would be will to toler   if we   re not will to specifi a numer target or upper bound for inflat  then we should find some other way to signal our determin to hold the line on inflat somewher  prefer befor that line is cross   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   littl has chang in the twelfth district    economi sinc we last met   it has continu to expand in line with the nation   for that reason  i   ll focus my remain remark on the nation economi   the data we have receiv sinc late januari have been remark consist in their upbeat messag   import indic from the output side   employ in manufactur product  in particular   gain strength over the past coupl of month   the same can be said of most of the major compon of domest demand   the strength in order and shipment for core capit good  despit the expir of partial expens  was particular signific   in the  book  all of this good news appear to show up most in the form of higher interest rate that offset the upward pressur on growth in the second half of this year and in        develop that bear on product have also been hearten   first is the recent upward revis to fourth quarter product growth as well as es  of continu strength for the current quarter   second  enhanc prospect for busi invest in equip and softwar bode well for product in the futur   final  some of the sign of slow in it  inform technolog  invest that were worrisom last year have moder  although there is still reason for some caution about the outlook   it invest bounc back in the fourth quarter  and product of high tech industri has been strong in recent month   taken togeth  these develop help to assuag concern about a pronounc slowdown in product growth  and i remain op ist that advanc in this area will continu to boost output growth and restrain inflat   of cours  there are alway risk   develop in oil market are an obvious one  and bond rate are anoth concern   it is strike that  until recent  long term rate were fall a bit  even as polici tighten and short term rate rose   the    year treasuri yield even now is below it level in     june when the committe first rais the fund rate  and this has led to consider discuss of   whether term premium have fallen to level that are lower than can be justifi by fundament   if the term premium is abnorm low now  econom growth could be signific dampen if the term premium sudden return to more normal level   and the risk here are nice illustr by an altern simul in the  book   for this reason  the low level of long term interest rate constitut a downsid real risk to the staff forecast   our staff decid to examin this issu more close   we look at sever model base approach to explain and es  the term premium for    year treasuri   all of the approach predict a lower averag premium sinc at least       compar to the averag for the     s   this result appear consist with a number of macro develop  includ reduc volatil in interest rate  output  and inflat   so a portion of the paradox of whi bond rate are so low may be that the term premium has declin for reason that are justifi by fundament  the element of risk for the outlook aris becaus the approach we examin suggest that the term premium is even lower than is justifi by fundament   accord to our es   long term rate still remain    to    basi point below the fundament consist level  even after the run up in long term yield sinc the last fomc meet   sinc our previous meet  the    year bond rate has risen by just under    basi point   use the approach that yield the larger term  premium conundrum  our analysi suggest that about one third   about    basi point   of the intermeet increas is due to the correct of the low term premium   the remain two third is split between a higher path for expect futur short term real interest rate  presum due to strong econom news  and higher inflat expect   the latter concern is reflect in an increas sinc late januari in inflat compens  especi over the next few year   part of this increas is probabl due to upsid surpris in recent inflat data and part of it to increas oil     price   our analysi suggest that oil develop might have rais    year inflat   compens by less than     percent  to sum up  our es  suggest that the term premium has probabl increas moder  about    basi point  sinc our last meet   but even so  the premium may remain as much as    basi point below normal  accord to our es    our analysi thus suggest that the risk for the term premium on bond rate are asymmetr   while the  book expect of a relat flat path for bond rate through the end of next year may be a reason modal forecast  i don   t think the risk here are balanc   and  inde  they seem to be on the side of restraint for demand  of cours  the recent news on inflat  and  in particular  the core pce in januari  was disappoint   and with oil price rise further  it seem reason to rais the core pce inflat forecast through      by a tenth or two  to just over     percent   but i do not think we should overreact to januari   s advers inflat data  especi in light of the continu contain of wage and salari and evid of even greater strength in actual and structur product growth than previous assum in the staff forecast  in my view  the polici situat has chang notabl sinc the last meet   we now see stronger momentum in aggreg demand  import due to more robust invest spend and slight disappoint inflat data   this mean  as is implicit in the  book forecast  that we now appear to be further from the real short term neutral fund rate than previous  and monetari polici remain quit accommod  what i would like to see today is for us to rais the fund rate by    basi point and retain both the    measur pace    languag and the character of polici as accommod   at present  i believ the  book path and market expect are quit well align and coincid with my own view of the appropri path for polici  given current inform   in my view the     term    measur pace    remain a good descript of the like path  and i would think it wise to act   to confirm market expect today rather than upset them   i don   t think that retain the    measur pace    languag elimin the committe   s flexibl to rais the fund rate by    basi point if it   prove necessari   obvious  such a move would need to be justifi by the strength of incom data  but with those data i believ the market would have adjust to the idea by the  e it becam appropri to implement it
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ seem definit on the upsw in new england   as we discuss condit with our beig book contact  met with our small busi advisori group  and talk in some depth with local temporari help agenc and softwar develop   as we did our usual round of contact   the theme of solid growth and increas confid were repeat with some frequenc  manufactur  especi those that have some defens busi  report veri good sale  and  at least in the case of one larg manufactur  an inabl to keep up with demand   labor market have strengthen as well  and benchmark revis to employ data indic that      was a better period for job growth in new england than previous thought   temporari help agenc report good demand for labor  and help want is stronger  as judg by both tradit measur and the index data on the region that are avail from mon  com   hous remain strong  though we don   t see much sign of specul and there is some soft at the upper end of the price rang   retail busi is report to be good  and both busi and consum confid has increas  contact in the region economi appear to be move from a focus on concern about demand to a greater focus on emerg issu around suppli and cost increas   we talk to a lot     of small busi in the period sinc our februari meet  and they almost uniform report   rise cost of raw materi and labor that are start to impact their price   in a grow number of case  these firm have been abl to make price increas stick  even to big buyer like wal mart  though  larg  the price increas have been in the form of surcharg  skill worker are becom difficult to find   busi report that they   re in a hire mode and have to pay up to get the peopl they need   some compani have begun to hire in advanc of need  simpli to have a pool of avail worker   capit spend plan seem quit solid  and now there is a mixtur of firm spend not onli to further increas product but also to expand to handl increas busi  two area of concern emerg beyond those relat to rise cost   the first involv tourism in northern new england   evid  while this was a snowi year in the southern part of our region  the northern area have suffer from both too littl snow and the  e of storm  which creat weekend travel problem   the second is a continu sluggish in commerci real estat market   given the number of larg merger affect the region  both in the financi servic industri and elsewher  and the reduct of headquart staff that has result  commerci vacanc rate remain high and rent low   especi in downtown and suburban boston   i should say the rent are relat low  sinc boston rent tend to be high anyway   this has not  howev  seem to put much of a crimp in the market for purchas commerci build  which continu to be quit strong  turn to the nation scene  i   ve been struck by the strength of the incom econom data  as has everyon els   we in boston have adjust our forecast upward  especi in the near term  as has the  book   use the same assumpt about polici  we end up fair close to the      book over the forecast horizon  though our calcul suggest some greater econom   capac and less downward pressur on the unemploy rate  howev  there is not a lot to argu about here  given the continu upsid surpris in overal econom growth and in price pressur   inde  it seem clear to me that the under rational we have use in move polici slowli and gradual to a less accommod place is becom question   unlik last year when growth seem fragil and uncertain  econom growth now seem solid and resili and in less need of polici accommod   overal credit and financi condit are support  if not encourag  to spend and growth   busi invest is not take a breather with the end of the tax incent  and consum aren   t either  except in their post holiday purchas of auto  sure it is possibl to see downsid risk from a rise in the save rate  from an untoward increas in oil price that impact demand  or from an impact aris out of the extern deficit   but i think it   s even easier to imagin upsid inflat surpris as rise energi  raw materi  import  and labor cost get embed into econom activ   in that regard  i found the  book altern focus on a spend boom and on a boom with rise inflat expect veri interest   i should also note that while my admir for the frb us model is enorm  i think it   s difficult for ani model to correct anticip the full interplay of econom factor onc the unexpect happen  the baselin  i think  is still pretti much a good  solid forecast   continu solid product growth will keep nascent cost pressur and inflat expect under control   howev  the risk that this will not happen seem to me to have grown and to have becom a bit more one side   that is  i think we need to be more focus on the risk that rise cost pressur will get out of hand  perhap it   s not a probabl outcom  but  if it   happen  it would be cost  accord  i think a     case could be made for move fa  rather than slower toward that so call neutral place   take   larger step now would have the benefit of affect market attitud toward risk in a posit way  larg becaus it is not what market expect us to do  that option has some attract to me   but it could be too much of a surpris and indic too much concern about futur prospect than perhap is necessari   howev  we could take advantag of this point in  e by prepar the market for greater polici flexibl   that is  we could chang the languag of the announc by follow the chairman   s exampl in take out the refer to a measur pace   in my view  anyway  that would have two benefit   it would continu the process of remov polici accommod  and it would focus market better on the uncertainti of the futur
thank you  mr  chairman   one of my busi contact  my wal mart contact  start our convers by say that the situat is rather strang   his word   spend come out of the christma season has been higher than anticip   with same store sale about   percent higher on a year over year basi   and they   re not sure where this strength is come from  they are anticip about that same strength  or mayb even a bit more  go forward   he note that their inflat situat is not a concern   their price overal are flat  food price are up a littl and price of nonfood item are down a littl   the labor market is veri stabl  wal mart is have no problem at all hire associ at their store   my up contact note an expans of their capit spend   he said that busi from retail mail order firm is veri strong   he indic that his compani has some labor concern   they may be face a strike later this year   a possibl pilot strike is the concern  i think   and they are     do conting plan for it   they do not believ that the rest of the industri has the capac   to fill in  should up be shut down  my fedex contact note also an increas in capit spend  up    percent for this fiscal year over last fiscal year   he indic that about two third of that is for expans of capac and about one third for product enhanc   also  he said that they had no concern regard labor avail   fuel price  obvious  are a concern for them  my contact in the truck industri had contrari inform   he said that demand is softer than anticip and that there has been a switch from prebook for truck ship servic to last minut book   he also note that the driver shortag is get wors and wors  a contact in a major softwar compani said that sale had come in a littl soft relat to their expect but attribut it to intel come up short on inventori   i think particular on notebook comput   appar intel was surpris by demand that was higher than anticip  also  i might mention that a contact in the bank industri note that c i  commerci and industri  loan year over year are now posit and acceler and that there appear to be a lot of momentum  let me turn now to some comment about the economi in general   we have in place a veri broad base and robust recoveri   busi fix invest is take hold and take the lead   i think it   s high like  of cours  that employ and incom will grow  which will provid support for consumpt  as the  book emphas   so even if we had a welcom increas in the save rate  we   d probabl see continu strength in consumpt  the  book contain   and we continu to hear elsewher   a lot of comment on energi price   in my view  it   s veri import that we think of energi price as be demand driven   this is not a suppli shock situat  there   s a worldwid demand increas   it may be  for some purpos      appropri to think about what the world would look like if energi price had not increas and   how much get taken off growth   but i   m not sure that that   s quit the right way to look at this  becaus the situat is be driven fundament by demand   it   s not that output is be constrain by energi  it   s that vigor output growth is drive up energi price  as for labor compens  product gain are hold down growth in unit labor cost  that   s a sourc of great stabil  let me make a general point about this expans that realli took hold rough six quarter ago   relat to u s  busi cycl histori  this expans has been one of the most order and best predict   the forecast error are astonish small   much lower than the usual standard error that we see   and i think that has a lot to do with the veri well balanc and order natur of the expans   this expans is about as surpris free as we ever see   i think our polici goal should be to maintain the order natur of the expans as far as we can  and  of cours  that includ as an essenti element maintain the stabl inflat environ  i think the staff forecast for both real gdp and inflat make a lot of sens   as point forecast  they   re as good as one can find   i think the risk around the gdp forecast are probabl pretti symmetr  but i do not believ that the risk around the inflat forecast are symmetr   i view the inflat forecast more as a median of the distribut than a mean   i think the distribut is skew to the right   that there   s a substanti higher probabl that we could have a    point upsid surpris than a    point downsid surpris on the inflat outcom   that   s all i   ll say at this  e   thank you

i have no humor in my statement and noth that differ from the consensus
your straightforward remark are veri humor    laughter
care    laughter   the near term outlook appear more favor to us  as it   to everybodi els   we have move up our forecast to reflect stronger  than anticip under growth and somewhat greater price pressur   on the expect that we will move the fed fund rate up at the somewhat steeper path now price in the market  we now expect real gdp to grow at a rough   percent pace in real term this year befor moder to around     in        and with this tighter monetari polici assumpt  we expect core pce to come  in a bit abov     percent but not abov   percent  as this impli  we are veri close to the  book on the broad outlin of the stori and quit close in the compon  too   we have a bit more invest and less consumpt and a littl higher net export drag this year   we have product growth a bit stronger but compens     growth and unit labor cost a bit softer   but overal we have a veri similar view to the staff forecast   on the broad forc support the expans   and we are quit comfort  as a result  with the case this stori present for tighten polici further and for signal more tighten to come   we see the risk as rough balanc around this slight higher path for growth and inflat   if there   s a case for asymmetri or less balanc in our uncertainti  it seem more like to be on the upsid than on the downsid   the rise in the two  to five year inflat expect in tip  in the face of what is otherwis reason encourag news on inflat fundament  bear care monitor   we now face a lower probabl that the core pce will come in at     percent rather than abov  and this itself suggest a higher path for the nomin fed fund rate   the anecdot stori seem to have improv alongsid the strengthen of privat forecast   our empir state survey show greater confid   greater op  about the next six month   than we   ve seen in some  e   i think we should be relat comfort  therefor  with both the direct and magnitud of the chang sinc our last meet in market expect regard the like path of the fed fund rate   i would be somewhat more comfort if the market were price in a somewhat higher probabl of a    basi point move at some point in the near term   i say this not becaus i think we can make the case now that we will need to move by    basi point ani  e soon but simpli becaus we need to make sure that we have the flexibl to do so   one of the consequ of the structur of our statement these day  at least until veri recent  is that the market have respond to stronger data or more inflat risk by rais the probabl of anoth    basi point increas beyond the next meet or two  but not by price in ani signific probabl of a steeper slope than    per meet   this has contribut to a remark reduct in uncertainti about monetari polici expect  which in turn has reinforc other factor that have work to bring about this broad pattern now evid of lower risk     premia across financi market   part of this is due to fundament  but part seem due to our   monetari polici signal   at the margin  this impli ceil on the slope of the path toward equilibrium rais the possibl that we will be perceiv at some point as take some risk of get behind inflat expect   buy some insur against this prospect small cloud on our credibl is prudent risk manag   this argu for adjust our statement to condit or qualifi    measur     and for do so ahead of when we might be forc to   this make sens even if we don   t want to signific steepen the impli path at this point   buy this flexibl now may entail some modest steepen in the path  but some risk in that direct is worth it   the addit benefit in gradual exit from the    measur pace    languag as we approach equilibrium  of cours  is that it will prepar the ground for a flatter path when that prove appropri   greater confid in the sustain of the main forc drive the expans suggest that the greatest risk to the forecast  apart from some shock  still lie in the imbal we face in our economi   those imbal are evid in the combin of the sustain rise in household debt  the project increas in public debt  and the deterior in our net intern posit   this probabl argu for tri to get the real fed fund rate up to a more posit level than might otherwis have seem appropri   that will help provid more traction   or at least some traction  sinc we don   t see much traction yet   to the process of adjust  allow the forc of graviti to contribut to a more gradual unwind of these intern and extern imbal and reduc some of the risk in the forecast   a more contractionari fiscal polici stanc would make this less necessari  but this   not now seem in prospect   thank you
thank you veri much   let   s break for coffe      coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   we are experienc a mini inflat scare     in financi market   a develop that we need to take veri serious   the primari reason for the scare was the recent rapid increas in the price of oil and other basic commod   other determin of inflat  it should be note  seem to be larg under control   still strong product growth and subdu wage increas have been suffici to induc some recent deceler in unit labor cost   at the sector level  recent increas in auto price seem unlik to continu  given the industri   s inventori overhang   and i note that this morn   s report show a     percent declin in februari in auto price   price of import consum good have also been remark tame  rise about   percent in the year to januari despit the fall in the dollar   and the influx of low cost apparel import associ with the end of the multifib agreement should provid more help on that front   inflat in servic is stabl  and far futur inflat compens  which effect strip out oil effect  has not risen   how serious is the inflat risk pose by rise commod price   one view  which  if correct  would be quit worrisom  is that commod price are the canari in the coal mine    indic of easi monetari polici and build inflationari pressur   i don   t find this view persuas  and i note that the academ literatur has found essenti no support for it   instead  recent commod price increas seem to be larg the result of econom develop unrel to u s  monetari polici  which i would call suppli shock  although without disagre with presid pool   what we   re say here is that china is exogen    laughter   in the case of oil  for exampl  intern agenc have recent revis downward their project of non opec product while increas their es  of global demand for crude  reflect in part the       likelihood that growth in demand this year will be disproportion concentr in energi ineffici countri  such as china   the weak dollar  which i suspect is respond more to the current account situat than to monetari polici per se  is also affect the oil price   sinc       oil price have risen    percent in dollar term  but they have also risen by    percent even in euro term and by    percent in yen term   if the suppli shock interpret is correct  then the effect on core inflat of the recent run up should be moder   as is well known  commod and raw materi make up a small share of produc    cost   for exampl  the staff es  that even in a full employ situat  in which firm have some price power  a   percent increas in the core ppi for intermedi good should result in less than a   basi point increas in the core cpi   by the way  i think that fact help to reconcil to some extent the benign inflat number with the anecdot report of price increas  sinc mani of them take place at the intermedi level   an interest datum from last week   s survey of    primari dealer is that  on averag  they expect core pce inflat of      percent at an annual rate dure the third quarter of this year  up onli   basi point from what they expect for the same period as of the week befor the last fomc meet   if we are  inde  face a suppli shock  then to some extent the situat is analog to where we were last spring when inflat pressur prove transitori and polici patienc paid off  howev  all economist have two hand   and on my other hand  i agre that there are also import differ from the situat last spring   the expans has consider more momentum today than it did then   core inflat is approach the top of my comfort zone  and i       would not like to see it go much higher   final  futur market suggest that this  e the shock to commod price are expect to be relat more perman than they were last  e   for these reason  the risk to both the output and inflat object of a slight more aggress polici postur seem fair modest   my bottom line is that i support rais the fund rate by onli    basi point today   howev  i believ that it would behoov the committe to modifi the statement in a way that signal the possibl of stronger action in the near futur   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i think i will be the fourteenth person to explain whi the balanc of risk is gradual chang   a few month ago  we were still worri about suppos soft spot but at this point the expans look pretti solid   hous and consumpt growth remain strong   the fear pothol in busi invest never materi  which strengthen the forecast in two way   not onli is there no pothol  but now the strength of invest last year can be attribut to under forc  not tax incent  and carri forward into this year   the intern economi look pretti vigor  especi for emerg market countri  and actual output expans is now be forecast even for japan   the blue chip forecast  which i use as a reflect of condit more than as forecast  are now be revis upward   the whole pictur look quit strong  and  if anyth  the risk are tilt to the upsid   condit will be veri strong if the person save rate  sn   t rise   a recent bank newslett was entitl    a whiff of inflat in the air      i actual think it is still possibl not to whiff inflat  but there is no deni that the risk are chang   oil price have jump up again both for the spot price and the far futur price   in contrast to earlier oil shock  which clear could be attribut to some disturb on the suppli side  the       present uptick seem more like due to intern demand condit  make the higher price less idiosyncrat and presum more last   other commod price have also jump   the dollar has fallen alreadi  and there will be continu fear that it will fall further  with these fear presum last until our intern liabil ratio stabil   a prospect that seem more remot by the day   so far  wage and unit labor cost have been a stabil forc but wage may becom less so as output gap tighten  and product growth rate could at some point stabil or declin  there is noth surpris or disappoint in this   if a year ago we had known that output growth would be healthi here and around the world  that output gap were close  that oil price were high  that commod price were high  and that the dollar was fall  we all would have been quit worri about inflationari threat   in a way  over this span the anti inflat news has been reason good   pass through have prove modest  and wage have been rather well behav   product has hung in there   but there is still an enhanc risk of inflat   in recent meet  i have held out one factor that could get me to be less hawkish   the prospect of real fiscal tighten   this has becom less like  too   there has been a disput between those who want to cut spend and extend the tax cut and those who want to maintain spend   when not deal with  oid in basebal and feed tube in florida  the congress seem to be work toward one of their uniqu compromis  let   s extend the tax cut and maintain spend    laughter   there just  sn   t seem to be much voic for and hope for real fiscal tighten  henc  whether one is look at output growth  inflationari pressur  or fiscal polici  the risk of fall behind the curv has increas   we have to keep rais rate   i am still in the camp        for    basi point per meet and for keep the    measur pace    rhetor for a littl while longer  but i am also for tighten up our rhetor in subtl or even occasion non subtl way   there has been some disput about the normat global impact of our low nation save rate  and i would like to say a word about that   when one aggreg the low person save and the larg budget deficit  the u s  nation save rate is at a post war low   how bad is that   given what appear to be a save glut around the world  some argu that it   s actual a good thing our nation save is low   otherwis  world long term interest rate would fall to veri low level   it is definit good for world saver that our own nation save is low   that maintain their return  but i am still more worri about s ul world invest than about the return realiz by saver  we all know that in this countri the number of worker per retire will fall from     now to   in about    year     is actual high by world standard   with present trend and with present polici  the same ratio will be a littl more than   for canada  franc  germani  korea  russia  and the unit kingdom  and actual less than   for itali and japan   that   s right   those two countri are on track to have more retire than worker   even in most emerg market countri  the ratio will not be much abov     bar the unlik case where nation social secur system are total fulli fund  the younger generat in all of these countri are go to need more capit to pay the retir and health cost of our generat   henc  i remain much less worri about the upward pressur that our low nation save put on world interest rate than the downward pressur it put on world invest   yes  in the short run our high budget deficit and low nation save are benefit world saver   but  no  in the long run  i don   t think they are benefit the world   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   at the last meet  i describ the economi    as be in what i call a mid cycl sweet spot  so the obvious question is  what has happen sinc then   i would say that  in general  my headlin is bifurc   one is     so far so good     and two is     there are a number of caveat      let   s first look at the    so far so good    part of the headlin   as all of you have alreadi point out  the economi seem to be gain momentum   household continu to be in good shape   the save rate is  unfortun  low  but that is support consumpt   household are also be support by an increas in compens per hour that continu to look quit robust   as the  book has point out  there seem to be no pothol on the invest side  so the busi fix invest compon is also kick in   nevertheless  as a number of you have alreadi indic  some concern have arisen recent on the inflat front   but i think we should also recogn that long term inflat expect continu to be well anchor   and import  while a number of cost have gone up  unit labor cost themselv continu to be  if anyth  quit moder   all of this suggest to me   though i will point out some caveat   that the incom data are not flash a signal that we are clear behind the curv   so what are the caveat that seem to be import   both of them deal with some uncertainti regard the suppli side of the economi   first  we have a question about what is go on in the labor market   as all of you know  sever meet ago  and then at the aea  american econom associ   i put forth some relat rudimentari analysi that suggest  that some of the declin we   ve seen in labor forc particip rate may not turn around veri quick   the staff has done some much more sophist analysi and has come to a not too dissimilar conclus   so i think we do have an oblig to mark down our expect of the       increas in labor hour that can go into overal potenti gdp   the staff has done that  and i support that conclus   the second uncertainti with respect to the suppli side has to do with product growth  this  i think  will be an ongo question for us for some  e to come   i recogn   as do other  includ presid     and applaud the fact that there appear to be mani posit sign with respect to product growth   we had a discuss in this room  for exampl  in a meet with the sia  suggest that moor   s law continu to be in shape  which is obvious a veri posit thing  and we have seen some upsid surpris in incom and product growth  which  again  is a veri posit develop   have said all of that  the staff take into consider the net debt financ of financi firm and the financ gap inform  both of which show that firm have a great deal of room  left to invest  the staff view those as posit sign that there is some potenti upsid to product   i would say that we should at least be a littl cautious in that assess becaus those develop may involv some negat sign   so i think there   s a littl question mark on the capit deepen compon of product increas   at this stage  i   m general will to support the consensus that has emerg around the tabl  and in the  book forecast  that product probabl is in good shape   but we need to monitor that  anoth caveat has to do with this issu of energi price   i  along with governor bernank  realiz that energi price play a relat small part in inflat in the u s  economi  particular against the backdrop of well contain unit labor cost   howev  like other  i recogn that the increas in oil price seem to have had a dramat impact on market psycholog and may be the thing that could undermin the relat well contain inflat expect that have been benefici to us   so  with regard to oil price  i   d agre with other that the suppli and demand       dynam are such that not onli are oil price like to be in a higher rang  as indic by the far date futur  but also that the surpris are more like to be skew to the upsid   in my view  the recent increas in oil price reflect some real concern that world suppli will not be abl to keep pace with demand growth  as a few of you have alreadi said   in particular  i think the cushion of spare product capac has narrow signific   in prepar for this meet  i ask the staff to do an option deriv probabl densiti function of wti price   i don   t have the result to hand out  but when one look at the decemb      function  there is a particular larg skew to the right hand side   i think this is tell us that there are signific market concern that price could surg in the event of suppli disrupt  these concern have push up both futur price   which to me can be interpret as a mean expect for futur spot price   and also spot price today  reflect  i think  some heighten precautionari motiv for hold inventori   so there is a real risk that with veri low short run price elast of demand  a suppli shock could lead to veri big move in price and potenti unhing the inflat expect that we have benefit from   so i think that is anoth caveat to worri about   final  presid   has rais a few  e the question of whether or not the predict of our languag has been the sourc of a reduct in either impli volatil or spread over treasuri   i had the staff do some basic histor chart to look at this issu   we first introduc in the chairman   s congression tes oni in      the notion that we   d keep rate low for a consider period  and that show up in our press statement for the first  e in august        sinc then  obvious  we   ve gone through other term such as    patienc        measur pace     et cetera   all of that i think has play to some degre in the reduct of impli volatil and spread over treasuri   but  in fact  if you look at a chart that show the movement down in       impli volatil and in the spread over treasuri  both start to declin mani  mani month befor our origin focus on use the kind of languag we   ve been use   so while i don   t necessarili disagre that there are carri trade and that some real risk have emerg  in my view we should not take too much of the blame for that upon ourselv   i think a number of market dynam have driven that  along with predict and transpar at the fed   that lead me to the final point  what   all this mean for monetari polici   first  i would say  at bottom  that i find the baselin outlook to be credibl and reason   but it is surround by a rang of risk that i believ  as do other  are primarili on the upsid   against that background  it seem prudent to continu to execut our pre announc strategi   the economi is grow well and need less and less s ulus  therefor  continu to remov our accommod polici at a measur pace seem to me reason   second  given the stage of the cycl  the skew in the general risk assess that i outlin  and the need to manag market expect  i think we should use our statement to signal our awar that inflat pressur may have pick up   the incom data are indic of that   if we are wrong on the upsid risk  both we and the market will adjust   on the other hand  if we fail to reflect the exist of these upsid risk  we could easili be perceiv as be behind the curv  with negat consequ in term of inflat dynam and  potenti  our own credibl   final  i think the statement  as draft in the last meet  clear link the concept of a measur remov of accommod with a general sens of the incom data   and i believ that give us the kind of flexibl that we need   therefor  i   m not terribl support of remov the    measur pace    concept at this stage   i think we have suffici flexibl use that phrase  when it is link to the incom data  to move more quick if we had to or to paus if we need to see       how thing were evolv   so i would caution against make that kind of chang in the statement today   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   activ has come in somewhat stronger in recent month  and price pressur have been a bit more intens than anticip at the last fomc meet  evid  continu good growth in incom and high profit are keep household spend rise brisk and erod ani remain busi caution   the fact that surpris have been concentr in invest in both busi equip and hous may also suggest that the low long term rate   the conundrum   have been have an effect   if  as seem like  those rate have been reduc in part by declin term premium  as presid   was discuss  and not just by an expect lack of vigor in demand here or abroad  their depress real level would repres a net s ulus to demand most especi for busi borrow who are face veri low risk premium   in fact  busi borrow has strengthen consider in the fourth and first quarter   and after an extend period in which cash flow have exceed busi invest  low interest rate and eb caution have produc a posit busi financ gap in the fourth quarter  which is project to continu for the first quarter   moreov  the u s  economi is not the onli one in which growth has pick up  the strengthen of demand seem widespread global after the disappoint in the second half of last year   and i agre with other who have note that the sharp upward movement in energi and other commod price probabl reflect in part this global pickup in demand   the surpris in core pce price was onli for one month and was small relat to our ignor of what drive those price   but it   rais the possibl that energi  other materi     price  and import price could be pass through to consum price more than anticip   this    coupl with the rise in near term inflat expect    elev the risk of second round effect from such relat price movement   and those relat price adjust have continu in recent week   still  a number of factor seem to be work to restrain tendenc for inflat to move higher  and we can   t ignor those   import  product growth was stronger in the fourth quarter  and  appar  in the first quarter  than anticip   whether that suggest fa  structur product growth than the staff has built in remain to be seen  but revis to actual product growth will help keep pressur off of labor cost and markup   part as a consequ  markup in the nonfarm busi sector remain at extraordinarili high level  give ampl scope for futur cost increas to be at least part absorb in reduc margin   and wage and compens growth remain essenti flat  indic to me that slack in labor market persist  given the upward pressur on compens that would otherwis be anticip from rise headlin inflat and the rapid product growth of recent year    bond rate have risen notic   to be sure  the upward movement seem most to reflect higher inflat expect  but higher nomin rate could have a notic effect on hous market where buyer seem sensit to the cash flow implic of their month oblig  hous price increas should slow quit a bit  in ani case  hold back the rise in wealth and boost incent to save out of current incom   in addit  gdp hasn   t been revis up as much as demand   as the trade deficit continu to surpris on the high side  the staff forecast has net export turn from a drag on activ to a more neutral influenc   but until we see the data confirm that shift  i think the possibl of more demand be drain abroad remain a downsid risk to the forecast      the final and most import forc that ul  will constrain inflat is tighten    monetari polici   and the narrow output gap and the possibl emerg of greater inflat pressur do rais question about how we need to adapt our strategi to keep inflat low and the risk in balanc   two possibl respons   one would be to count on extend the gradual path of rate increas to go for longer befor slow or stop   the other approach would be to increas the inclin   prepar to rais rate by    basi point soon   for the most part  extend the measur path seem prefer to me   at the same  e i think we should make it clear to market  that we are prepar to extend that path  should circumst call for it  and that we have no firm preconceiv notion regard where our tighten should stop   the gradual approach should enabl us to better gaug the ongo effect of our action in an uncertain world   it will give us more opportun to assess the effect of past tighten move when we know that those effect can vari and will occur with a lag   henc it will give us more opportun to calibr our action better to the need of the economi   to date  announc that we expect to remov accommod at a measur pace hasn   t materi imped the market from respond meaning and appropri to incom data  over the last intermeet period  they extend the anticip seri of gradual rate increas    forward rate two and three year out are up by more than    basi point over that period  and this seem complet appropri to me   the structur of interest rate still seem to be consist with achiev our object   the staff forecast has inflat declin with about the polici tighten that is built into the market  even if we   re not quit as op ist on price pressur as the staff  gradual increas in the fund rate in line with market expect should provid some insur against rise inflat  inflat expect beyond the next few year haven   t increas  indic that market     particip expect that the polici action they now anticip will be enough to insul the longer   term trajectori for price from near term increas in inflat   as a consequ     measur    is still my best guess as to how polici rate will evolv  and that   s what i would continu to indic to the public   nonetheless  our expect of a measur pace of firm has alway been condit   and one essenti condit that we have articul and emphas in the last sentenc of the announc is that inflat and it expect remain well behav   in my view  that would be consist with the rate of growth of core pce price stabil at level close to or not veri much abov the experi of the last year   if doubt about our willing to maintain price stabil emerg  i can see the potenti for a veri difficult self reinforc feedback loop through declin confid in policymak in the unit state and acceler dollar depreci   incom inform suggest that core price will continu to acceler  or that the output gap is close rapid  or that longer run inflat expect are deterior  could well call for deviat from the measur pace with a larger firm action   if the sign were serious enough  i think we could  and should  do that as soon as the next meet  even if the    measur pace    languag remain in place   after an express of concern about inflat pressur  as suggest in altern b  the market should not be entir surpris by such an action under those circumst   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom growth this quarter  as sever of you have note  has been stronger than we earlier had anticip   retail sale exclud auto have grown at over a   percent annual rate in the first two month of the quarter   busi invest has been strong and   not show a signific declin as a result of compani have move invest into the fourth quarter to take advantag of the last month of partial expens for tax     purpos   manufactur output has also been grow sound  and capac usag is now close to   it averag of the last decad at      percent   and employ has been grow at a good pace   over the last few month  we have seen core inflat move modest higher   and we are see data that indic price pressur come from both the sale and the cost side of compani  the strong growth of recent month is make it easier to rais price  and rise cost from both commod and labor are also ad to cost pressur   this econom expans is reach it fourth anniversari  and sale level now are give busi the confid to be abl to rais price   the beig book and comment by sever of the presid today indic that busi are find it easier to do so   the nfib survey show more price power for small busi  and other busi survey are indic the same   as dave   note earlier  rise import price are also give domest compani more price power   on the cost side  the extraordinari pace of product growth has slow in the past year  product grew at a     percent pace in the year end in the first quarter       but fell to about one fourth that pace in the second half of last year   while product is still veri strong from an histor perspect  it has slow enough that the direct of unit labor cost has chang   unit labor cost began rise in the second quarter of       after fall for two year  and grew at     percent in the last quarter   thus  with the outlook for continu strong econom growth  i believ that we cannot be as sanguin about the trend in price in come month   we need to be signal that we are more depend on incom data  and i think that requir a chang from the    measur pace    languag to give us more flexibl in the month ahead   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in my comment i want to follow up on presid guynn   s and presid     s observ about specul hous invest   we have heard     increas anecdot evid and concern about this issu  and i think the character in   ye day   s wall street journal that day trade is now occur in residenti hous market is a further indic of the concern   of cours  the extent to which the specul purchas make a differ is reflect not onli in the possibl of it impact the pace of the growth in hous valu but also the price of risk  as jack suggest   but i think the question has been whether or not the size of the market was signific enough to have an impact   clear  the trend was eye  catch  but was the market signific enough to make a signific differ   data collect recent and provid by our economist indic that non owner occupi mortgag constitut     percent of the total outstand and have fluctuat around   percent of new origin   with respect to second home  the number were about     percent of total mortgag loan and   percent of new origin   howev  this week  the nation associ of realtor revis signific their sens of the size of the market  base on survey they had made and also on inform from the      census bureau report   they indic that  in their view     percent of all home purchas in      were for invest and an addit    percent were for vacat home   the differ was that through their survey they have been abl to isol the invest purchas of singl famili home as distinct from the purchas of a second home   the implic of that are signific  and the size of the market is much larger than they had perceiv   also  those number would suggest that mani of those buyer have made multipl purchas of singl famili home  which bring in anoth element of risk   the risk associ with the debt servic capabl they need to maintain those purchas in the event of a downturn  i think it   s appropri that we are go to be look at the issu of real estat bubbl and the specul compon of that market at our meet in june   there are a number of indic that mortgag lender are tighten up   both pmi and mgic indic recent that they have     tighten their loan requir for interest onli loan and for those with low down payment    and we have seen the criteria for loan be tighten in other place also   with respect to our polici decis today  i think the question is not so much what we should do but how we explain whi we are do it   as governor   did  let me take you back    month  when we began use the phrase    for a consider period      notwithstand the impact on impli volatil  also implicit in the statement    for a consider period    was that there need to be an exit strategi   and the exit strategi   or transit  if you will   went from    consider period    to    patient    to    measur pace      i don   t think today is the  e to chang    measur pace     but it   s  e to think about an exit strategi from it   thank you
low will be hand out copi of my present  as can be seen in the upper left panel of your first exhibit  the expect trajectori of feder reserv tighten now step up consider more steepli than was the case at the  e of your februari meet   in part  this movement is an exampl of how word can matter   chairman  span   s tes oni  along with other remark by feder reserv offici  appar led market particip to

financi condit show mix chang over the intermeet period  as the ratchet higher of corpor yield in line with those on treasuri was accompani by about unchang equiti valu and modest depreci of the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   if you believ that these financi condit are like to be consist with relat favor macroeconom outcom in come quarter   perhap  as in the top panel of exhibit    along the contour of the  book forecast for resourc slack and inflat   you would presum want to deliv the polici path current built into market expect   what you   re expect to do is firm   point today and signal that you believ you will continu march the fund rate higher for some  e thereaft  which is what we tri to convey with altern b in the bluebook   as can be seen in the middl panel  a nomin fund rate of    percent would fit within the rang of recommend for the second quarter from the polici rule that we routin track   and the result real feder fund rate  the solid black line in  the lower panel  would move closer to model base es  of it equilibrium valu   of cours  a    basi point hike in the fund rate today would make up twice the distanc to the red band of es  of the equilibrium rate  but you might not favor such a move for two set of reason   for one  market particip would be caught unawar  and you might be concern that they would conclud that the committe had discov itself behind the curv and build in expect of addit    basi point hike that could signific constrict financi condit or roil market   for anoth  you might not see the need for a brisker pace of polici tighten at this  e  resourc slack probabl still remain  and pressur on inflat   although a bit more intens of late   have most been held in check         thus  issu for today   s meet would seem to be what you anticip do at the next few meet  and  work backward  what that impli for the languag of the committe   s announc today   your answer to those question  in turn  depend on how far you think the fund rate is from neutral   the top left panel of exhibit   provid a longer perspect on the path for the feder fund rate current embodi in financi market price   judg from futur quot  you   re expect ul  to bring the fund rate to    percent   that is about the same answer we get from a multifactor model attempt to explain the term structur of treasuri yield  as plot at the right   the solid line in the middl left panel plot the averag respons from the blue chip survey  which ask economist where they expect the three month treasuri bill rate to be six to ten year from now   their answer       percent   is onli a bit higher than that infer from financi price   the survey also report the averag of the    highest and the    lowest respons   plot as the dash line   out of the    or so economist particip   the wide span cover by the survey respons underscor the rang of view about the destin of your current tighten cycl    those of you who identifi relat more with the respond in the bottom quintil like forese paus in the process of firm some  soon   work to reinforc that opinion would be the belief that recent higher inflat read are larg transitori   in that regard  it is true that businesspeopl have talk more of late about pass higher cost through to their custom and hint about renew    price power      howev  as shown in the middl right panel  fair consist over  e  and for longer than the sampl plot here   the share of the small busi respond to the nfib survey report plan to increas price has move close with real oil price   you might interpret that correl as suggest that anecdot are heavili influenc by pressur pose by higher energi cost and may  as governor bernank note  be a featur of intermedi good and servic rather than an independ sourc of inflationari impetus   in that regard  you might take comfort from the fact that five to ten year ahead inflat compens infer from treasuri yield  and plot as the red line in the lower left panel  is up onli modest and remain well off it      peak   with longer term inflat expect well contain and resourc slack appar be work down slowli  the committe may see relat littl cost in continu along a path of gradual remov of polici accommod   that may inclin you to choos the word of your statement so as  at the least  to keep market particip from mark up their expect path of tighten or  perhap  even rotat that path down  which is what we tri to do with altern a in the bluebook   some other on the committe  howev  might look at this same chart with trepid   sinc earli februari  near term inflat compens has risen about    percentag point and longer term compens is up about    basi point   this could be taken as a palpabl sign of inflat jitter that should be dealt with prompt       and forc  perhap lead you to tighten    basi point today or to toughen the word of your statement so as to warn investor of such a possibl in may    in that regard  such a decis might reflect a view of long run outcom for the short rate as be more like than not at or abov the blue chip averag    even if you had a benign point forecast for inflat over the next two year  such as the  book outlook for core pce inflat shown as the solid line at the lower right  you might not view the outcom on both side of that central tendenc with equanim   and the width of the fan chart surround that forecast suggest that the odd of a differ outcom are sizabl   if inflat run on the high side of the staff forecast  you may well have to pick up the pace of firm and work hard to contain inflat expect  even as financi disrupt becom more possibl   in contrast  with the momentum of aggreg demand well entrench  inflat fall short of what is current expect could be dealt with more readili   at first market particip would unwind some of the anticip restraint alreadi embodi in financi price  give the committe some  e to calibr it set of polici through it communic   some member may believ that project a more forc sens of resolv now might lessen the risk of an advers outcom by help to keep inflat expect firm anchor   we tri to accomplish this with altern c in the bluebook  which introduc resourc slack as a concern and assert that inflat pressur have intensifi   a common slur about economist is that they are drab and colorless   not so  this bluebook set new record for the varieti of hue use for font   the best exampl of this is repeat as your next exhibit  which was in a box in the polici altern section   over upcom meet  the committe like face five key issu concern it statement languag   first  as note in the markup of the februari fomc statement  you will need to determin whether the character of the stanc of polici   mark in red   should be modifi in some way   second  as note in blue  the fomc may need to revis it assess of the pace of under product growth in light of the realiz and anticip slow in actual product growth   third  the assess of inflat and inflat expect    note in     may need to be revisit   fourth  as mark in purpl  the committe may wish to remov the    measur pace    languag at some  e   this might be the case if the committe judg that a paus in the process of remov polici accommod might be call for or  altern  if it determin that econom circumst could requir a more rapid polici adjust some  e soon   howev  elimin the    measur pace    languag without a replac would leav the risk assess paragraph without a signal about the futur direct of polici   that omiss rais the fifth issu   note in orang   regard the balanc of risk assess   for refer  the last exhibit repeat the tabl of altern statement that staff circul in the bluebook with a few chang reflect comment receiv sinc public   two design principl serv as the basi for altern b   first  it     seem import to highlight the committe   s watch about inflat develop   henc  the rational paragraph point out that inflat pressur have pick up  with this latest draft a bit tougher on that score than the earlier version  second  it seem import to remind peopl that keep the risk balanc may take some effort   henc  the assess of risk is explicit condit on an appropri path for polici   the committe has accompani it six prior tighten with an assess of balanc risk  so observ must by now have infer that it was base on an appropri polici   howev  i must admit that explicit state that condit will limit the use of this form of the risk assess in signal the direct of futur polici move   but you may believ that the use shelf life of this languag has alreadi pass  in the bluebook  altern a and c offer an altern formul of the risk assess that could work now or in the futur   both drop the    measur pace    languag   in altern a becaus it seem to rule out a paus ani  e soon and in altern c so as to signal a fa  pace of firm   and adopt a risk assess base on an unchang polici for the next few quarter   it may be prematur to adopt such languag now  but have a discuss about such a possibl might be the first step in the process
thank you   question for
let me ask you about your last few sentenc   you said that if we use     the altern b version for the balanc of risk  that limit it use in the futur becaus if we ever say the risk are not balanc  then we   re confess that polici is inappropri in some sens  when i first saw that claus i like it  but i think if you look at it cross eye  it may not be so good  and i agre that we ought to recogn that if we use that word this  e  we probabl can   t use it again
you can   t use it to signal the direct of rate   so if it stand in isol   that is  if there are no other statement provid guidanc in that portion of the announc   you won   t be tell market particip anyth particular use   a risk assess base on appropri polici would onli be unbalanc if you thought  first  you were behind the curv  second  if a shock came that was so larg and sudden that the lag in monetari polici did not allow you to offset it  or third  if there were a particular larg skew one way or the     other   so  the question is   is it news to put this claus in the paragraph   i guess i   d have to argu   that it realli isn   t  becaus how could you have been tighten six  e off a risk assess that was balanc  unless it was implicit condit on appropri polici   the suggest in the bluebook was to make that condit explicit becaus  at this particular point  it would emphas that it take some work to keep the risk balanc   but i did want to flag to you that if you go in that direct  at some point along that road you are not go to be happi with the statement
i had similar concern to governor     s about the    appropri polici action    languag   and given the length of your discours     which certain was interest in support the languag  and the level of detail that you just went into in describ it  i think it   s go to be veri hard to explain to other what the heck we   re talk about here   i realli think all    appropri polici action    is say is that we can do our job   we   ve dealt with situat befor where we   ve move polici but continu to say that the risk were balanc   and with the    accommod    languag  i think we could continu to say that the risk are balanc and the whole statement would still flow logic   i   m also concern in altern b about the rise in energi price not notabl feed through to core consum price   core consum price are up a full percentag point on a year over year basi  and there has been some feed through   we think it   s go to slacken  and mayb you want to put that refer in the futur  but i   m not sure that this is what we want to say in this statement   i think we   d be better off leav that sentenc out and just go with    pressur on inflat have pick up in recent month and price power is more evid
i think we put that in there becaus later in the statement you do say that under inflat is expect to be contain  and it seem necessari then to provid at least some offset to the concern express earlier about pressur on inflat have pick up
the critic word is    notabl      that the rise in energi price    has not notabl fed through to core consum price   it   s not say that the pass through is zero
a doubl in the rate of core inflat on a year over year basi
if you actual trace through the cost structur  energi price can impact on core price in onli two way   in unit labor cost or in petrochem feedstock price spread out through various constitu element in the product process it affect   the latter is actual a veri small part of gdp
i guess my point is that i wouldn   t make that particular statement   i think that pressur on inflat have pick up and price power is more evid   after all  we have to believ that under inflat can be contain or els we   d be move a lot more strong now  so  i don   t think it   s inconsist to stop the sentenc
well  there   s anoth reason it   s in there   the fact is that we need to put someth like that in the statement today becaus of the current energi price environ   if we have onli a margin statement about the impact of energi price on gdp  it   s go to rais the question  in what cave have they been oper
yes  i was worri about that  too
i think   is next
i want to express concern about the phrase    appropri polici action     too  for the reason that have been discuss here   i don   t think we need it   i realiz that it   show that some effort is requir to have the risk balanc and that it is somewhat of a signal that we   re readi to do more  if necessari   but if we have the refer in here to inflat  which i believ are veri import  i don   t think we need that phrase at this point   and it   open the pandora   s box that   has describ so care   so my prefer is not to use that phrase
how would you
i would just drop it
you would just say     the committe perceiv the upsid      and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil
i would say they    remain rough equal
that   s a tough one   we   ve gotten away with that word as we   ve rais the fund rate  on the ground that we are remov accommod   so it has had no real signific impact   but in term of that statement be true  the truth of the matter is that as we continu to move up  it   s less credibl   i happen to think it make a good deal of sens to put that phrase in there  but i believ what ned   say is quit correct   we   re not go to be abl to use that again and we probabl will not want to   basic  there is an inher contradict in say that the risk are balanc but we   re tighten   now  we can say we   re not tighten if we   re remov accommod  but we can do that for just so long   and i think we   re get to the point where we have a problem with that languag   we   ve gotten away with it  but i don   t think we   re go to get away with it veri much longer   this particular phrase we put in is  in my judgment  a way to work our way out of that   but i   m not sure how long we can use it
we   d have to recogn it   s veri short live
oh  absolut
could i make a friend amend  presid     it is veri danger to do this at the eleventh hour   i wish i   d gotten into this sooner  and i apolog for not do so   but we could go down to the sentenc in altern c for the balanc of risk statement  and then back to the last two sentenc in    b      and i think that outdo your suggest
can you read that
whether we keep the sentenc that cathi talk about or not  we   d have     the sentenc that say price power is more evid   and then we   d go to    the committe perceiv that if the current target for the feder fund rate were maintain for the next few quarter  it is more like than not that output would grow at a pace fa  than sustain and that inflat pressur would pick up      that say exact what we think
that may be   but as i said to one of my colleagu earlier  if we use that languag  i hope you   re not stand next to the market when that come out  becaus i  think it rais too mani issu that we don   t need to rais at this stage   your argument are  in my judgment  general valid  but i would hold off on them   i think we can correct this problem at the may meet   in my view  that word is a littl too edgi and risk laden to tri it at this stage  it   s too soon     speaker      just so i   m clear  how would you suggest we correct it at the may meet
basic  by the may meet  we   re go to know a good deal more about how this particular issu is emerg   we may find that the staff   s product number  which move growth in unit labor cost down  are begin to show up in the marketplac and it will make a lot of this discuss moot   or we may find that we don   t have data fulli through the first quarter and onli have approxim for the numer of output per hour   and we don   t know that we   re not go to get a signific revis come from bls  bureau of labor statist   which would alter the employ data for novemb  decemb  januari  and februari on the upsid   and all of a sudden that    or     percent product increas will disappear  and we have higher unit labor cost and we have other thing go on      my impress is that we   ve had a good deal of chang from the last meet  but i suspect    that go into may   there will be a lot more chang in the pace than we have now   we can project out  but our abil to forecast where we   re go to be on may   is not all that terrif   presid guynn
mr  chairman  i   m not sure i follow all the altern  but let me weigh in on the draft languag in cell b  as well   if we   re go to make that kind of chang in the languag  i think there   s a better way to do it that will be a better transit in term of the guidanc we offer   i would suggest anoth altern   i guess it   s the fifth altern on the tabl   use word like    condit upon the current path of polici  the risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil are rough balanc      that   a coupl of thing   it seem to me link to the path of polici that i heard most of us around the tabl say we are comfort with  and it get around the problem that bill pool talk about in term of our inabl to find word to describ the distribut of risk   i think someth like that is a better transit paragraph
tri that again   that is not a bad idea
condit upon the current path of polici  the risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil are rough balanc      to me it combin a number of thing i heard around the tabl   also  i want to say that i come out of the same cave as cathi on the b  cell   although we didn   t have ani quid pro quo when we vote for earli releas of the minut   one of the effect that a lot of us hope for was that we could simplifi our statement   it seem to me that we have a chanc to do that by drop that whole last sentenc in b  about energi price and consum price   i think we could depend better on the minut that come out in three week to     flesh out that risk as well as other that we   ve talk about   to me it   s a great opportun to   simplifi the statement a littl
i think there   s a disadvantag in valid the market   s current expect so explicit   there are two way to think about frame our polici assumpt or give a signal   one is to say     with polici unchang  et cetera      the other is to say     take the expect path now price in the market  we think x      that   s an approach a number of central bank have taken   to me it  sn   t make sens to make that signific a chang in our basic signal at this  e  i think there   s a lot of risk in a valid that explicit   in my view  there   s actual a lot of virtu in the combin of these chang to the statement  becaus they condit and qualifi    measur    without take that word out   so it   s a move in the direct of give us more flexibl without claim we think there   s been ani abrupt chang in the balanc of risk   as   said  we can fall back on make explicit what has been implicit   which is that the risk have been balanc onli if we commit to do the right thing   if you don   t believ we   re go to do the right thing
may i tri just one more thought   i meant to say this earlier   i think jerri jordan  wherev he is on his sailboat  would smile at b   becaus i think we   re say exact what jerri tri to get us for year to say   if polici is set appropri at the meet  the risk should alway be balanc   i think it actual neuter the entir balanc of risk statement
may i suggest someth   i think you   re address an issu for the may meet  we have to be care about how far we move at this particular stage   all the issu that have been rais with respect to this question are valid one  and what we   re do is struggl to find the best way to handl it   to date  i think we have been remark fortun in     our phraseolog and our expect  and we have not run into someth that came out of left field   of which we weren   t awar   but if we reach too far at this stage  we may find that we   re press  and as roger indic  we have degre of volatil with respect to the futur   inde  what   also show is that the market are adjust to feder reserv polici in a way that cannot continu   in other word  we don   t have the omnisci to be abl to look out suffici far to continu what we have been tri to do   and have been abl to do more success than we have ani right to expect   so  i think we have to be a littl care about this   quick  becaus we have other colleagu who want to speak to this    speaker       i have one concern with    measur     and that is that it mean    basi point
it   and it   not   and i hope that in the minut    becaus i   m go to say someth about it   we tri to take away that notion that    measur    mean    basi point   presid santomero
the onli thing that concern me about the sentenc we   ve been work on is this  i   m not sure it actual   anyth good   where we were  to my mind  may be better than where we   re go   i   m not sure what    should    mean in the context  and i   m not sure the condit actual move us ahead   we may be better off stay with the word in the februari statement  which is ambigu as to polici action and  sn   t talk about normat statement like    should      that has the benefit of not move us in the wrong direct  so we can address where we want to be in may
one possibl   i   m not necessarili argu for this   is instead of the    appropri polici    to say    with current polici action      but i think this is a discuss for the may meet   the reason i say that is not that the argument essenti are     wrong  but becaus this is such a fundament shift that to tri to do it in this type of environ is   probabl not wise
it   s onli if we shift at all
i know  but the problem is that if we don   t shift   if we retain the same statement on upsid and downsid risk as the last  e   i think we   ll run into troubl  presid
there   s someth high iron about this whole discuss to me   we initi introduc the balanc of risk statement in order to communic about the direct of polici without talk explicit about interest rate or polici   we were reli on this sort of simpl version of a polici rule wherebi the public could general decod what we were talk about   then in      we hit a problem becaus we had both rise real growth and fall inflat  and we need to disentangl it into two differ part   after that  we trump it with anoth statement that is now wide seen as convey the real inform about the direct of polici  so the balanc of risk is seen as communic about the direct of the economi and  iron  we   re put    polici    into the balanc of risk statement in order to clarifi it mean about the economi
let me ask one thing about all of this discuss   this draft  languag was in the bluebook origin   whi haven   t you communic all of your concern  that   s precis the purpos of have that in the bluebook
did they all convey this to you
well  you obvious didn   t convinc him    laughter
mr  chairman  where i was go on this was to say that we have the    minut now to convey in a rich format what we view as the like direct of the economi and of polici   i think we   re have troubl with this  and we are go to have troubl with this   and i don   t have ani view about whether now or may is the right  e to chang the languag   becaus we   re place more weight on the balanc of risk statement
whi don   t we handl this by replic part of this argument in the minut to convey what the issu are rather than argu it now   well  we should argu it now   laughter
the ul  place i was go was to suggest that some  soon we consid drop this whole statement
that we can do
i hope that is the decis   as for the balanc of risk assess  i don   t think we need it in the statement   i don   t think it serv ani purpos
that is a valid issu to put on the tabl   presid pool
it   s import  as we   ve said befor  that the minut be true to the transcript  but it   s also import that the statement be true to the whole process   we don   t want to say someth now that   s go to be mislead   i think the minut need to convey the difficulti that the committe has had in come up with altern word that is not mislead to the market  and that that   s the reason for leav the statement as is   the minut can tri to give a full explan   around the tabl there   s probabl a major   i didn   t do a count but i   ll make a guess    who believ that the inflat risk are tilt to the upsid now from whatev the point forecast is      at least that   s the way i   d put it   i believ that is probabl the major sen ent   so  strict   speak  say that the risk are balanc isn   t an accur reflect of the view around the tabl   in ani event  i don   t think we can solv this issu  as you   re emphas  at this point   but the minut need to explain veri care the difficulti the committe has had with the word for the statement   and the minut should note that this will be on the agenda for the futur to make sure that we have statement at the conclus of the meet that are accur and do not mislead
right  and that we   re keep for the moment what we have there  becaus to go back to the origin is wors
i think that   s the onli practic altern at this point
to go back to the origin is wors
no  i would just keep it as is   i agre
i agre with presid pool
can we all agre on that particular phraseolog   we will tri to repres in the minut the substanc of this discuss to telegraph where we are  go forward  includ our discuss of all the various altern   and we   ll leav it for the may meet to work this out   my recollect is that  when we start off with these statement  it was alway the view that they would have to evolv as we move from one stage to the next   we knew we would have to decid how to do that  becaus to tri to fix the format didn   t work   we   re demonstr that the fix format don   t work   we   ve evolv it into a differ form of communic  and so far we   ve been success in do that   but let   s agre  as i assum we   re say  to leav the statement as it is and proceed to qualifi this howev we wish to in the minut  which  obvious  you will all have a chanc to evalu   and then we can open up the issu in some detail in may
i have just a quick suggest   if we   re realli go to tackl this in may     we ought to tri to get draft of what we   re go to work with out earlier than a coupl of day befor the meet so we have more  e to share our view
there   s no reason whi we can   t
that would be my plea
yes  that   s easi enough    laughter
final  i hope  presid
i just want to be sure i understand what you mean by leav the statement the way it is   i assum you mean take the altern b languag and leav it the way it is
okay  though i   m not real happi with that   but i get your point that a move of    basi point  with an emphasi on inflat pressur that haven   t been there in the past and a refer to how difficult the decis was not to take away the    measur    languag will prepar everybodi for what we might do at the may meet   in that case  if all goe as we expect it to go   and that   s a big    if     i know   we probabl will be abl then to talk about remov the    measur pace    languag   i also hope  along the line of presid     s suggest  we can talk about take away the balanc of risk languag   i don   t think it   s serv us well anymor
well  that   s on the tabl   and i think we should not be fixat on ani past structur of the statement
i also agre with presid guynn that just have the weekend to look  this over was not enough  e   it was a littl like order chines food   choos two from column     a  two from column b  and two from column c   we can   t do this with onli a day or two to review   it
i think that   s a valid request  and i see no reason whi we can   t separ that from the bluebook general  becaus it realli  sn   t rest all that much on either the  book materi or the rest of the bluebook   unless someth extraordinari happen in the period from now until late april  it  sn   t strike me that how we come out on this issu is go to  be depend on either the  book or the bluebook   okay  are there ani further question   laughter  speaker      what do you think we ought to do    laughter
well  i had an hour and    minut worth of comment prepar  but basic let me just say this  i think the reason we   re have these sort of difficulti is becaus we   re run into what i suspect may well be the tail end of the s ulus that has occur in the world economi from extraordinari chang in global in the past    year  the best way to see that is to look at how the pattern of the propens to invest domest save in domest invest has chang   that   s becaus one of the best measur of global is essenti the correl coeffici between pair of domest save and domest invest by countri   one way of state it is to use the terminolog of home bias   to look at the extent of home bias that exist in the world   start in the earli     s  home bias began to break down   we   ve seen a broaden effect  which arguabl has been the major factor in creat a disinflationari environ   and that essenti has enabl us to have this extraordinari period of econom growth  product increas  and remark low rate of inflat   coupl with that  obvious  has been a partial  but not wholli  independ chang in technolog that has allow unit cost to move lower        i suspect  but do not know  that we may be near the end of that process   we are now look at a differ model  at least for the unit state  given the fiscal polici problem that we will have as we get into the next decad   and rememb that the latter tranch of the    year treasuri note are move into that decad enough to impact on rate current   my suspicion is that we   re go to see real long term rate and real mortgag rate begin to move up and that the capit gain we have seen in both the stock market and in hous valu will becom a lesser sourc of fund for borrow   there will be less financ use  realiz capit gain   or  inde  even unreal gain   and that will have a signific impact on consumpt expenditur   rememb     to    percent of person consumpt expenditur do not relat to incom  they are the consequ  at least econometr  of the wealth effect   therefor  a signific amount of person consumpt expenditur has been financ  and it look from the way the balanc sheet are come out  that these expenditur have been financ larg from mortgag debt   the big rise in mortgag debt has essenti been the sourc for put into cash for consumpt purpos a fair signific part of capit gain  real long term rate may go up   it   s hard to forecast  but look at the long term fiscal situat  i   m not exact op ist  especi in light of what happen last week   the likelihood that the fiscal problem will be address has weaken   i believ governor   character it quit appropri   so i think the longer term issu essenti are begin to guid us now with respect to the shorter term  in my judgment  the median forecast for the unit state is reason well captur in the  book  and it may inde be the mean forecast   i would even ventur the possibl  although it   s arguabl  that the probabl distribut of these outcom may  in fact  be rough symmetr   but what is not symmetr is the loss function   as i think cathi   mention     earlier  if we were to becom a bit more aggress in tighten polici in this context and it turn   out to be wrong   in other word  if actual unit cost and price inflat simmer down a bit so far as core inflat is concern   the damag to the economi and to polici would not be all that great   it is obvious negat in the sens that the outcom is differ from what one expect   but not compar to the polici problem we   d run into if we maintain a postur that presuppos the median outlook  name  the  book outlook  and we are wrong   in the latter case  i think the cost would be great and the damag veri difficult to recov from  for those of us who rememb how we struggl in      with the pattern of adjust and how we were tri to get ahead of the curv   and eventu had to move    basi point in one month   i trust the memori is such that we don   t want to go there again   we were veri fortun that we got a soft land in       but it was fortun  not great polici   we may have thought that we tri in advanc to communic to the market that we were go to move in februari        they were not listen  and we ran into all sort of difficulti  therefor  i conclud at this particular stage that we have to start move in the direct where our previous convers left us   so i would recommend a move in the fund rate of    basi point and the altern b languag that is in this vector
mr  chairman  i   m okay with this   i do want to say  though  that your last comment on the loss function is realli a major concern of mine   to the extent that we are too slow on move back into the neutral zone  i think the danger is that later on we will have to go higher fa  and the impact on the economi will be more signific at that point   i think we   re at that point  and that   s whi at the may meet it is so import that we make some hard choic   and i am worri about that
i agre with that   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your propos  and i agre with your    analysi that the loss function is shift and that we need to be veri care not to get behind the curv here   i think the propos languag will put peopl on notic that we understand that that loss function is shift and that this is where our concern are   so  i agre with the propos languag   i   d like to make a few comment on the previous discuss   the differ between the altern b and altern c balanc of risk statement   name  what to assum about polici    was exact one of the issu that divid the second   subcommitte   i was  at that point  in what is now the altern c column  and i was a tini minor on that   at least  i felt like a tini minor on that subcommitte   but we   ve been around this sever  e   and  actual  most of you didn   t like the altern c languag  though i think it ul  could be use   i do worri somewhat about presid     s propos to remov both the balanc of risk languag and the    measur pace    languag   i think someth forward look ought to remain in the statement   mayb it  sn   t need to be formula  mayb  as suggest  when we debat it  we could chang it from  e to  e   i think it   s import that market aren   t more certain than we are about our action  but  to the extent that we can tell them someth true about what we   re go to do and where we expect thing to come out  i believ asset price will be better   i don   t think we should be insert uncertainti into the market just to insert uncertainti into the market   if we know someth about or have a sens of where we   re go  somehow say that in some way will make asset price more reflect of realiti   my third point is that there is a tradeoff here between how quick the draft statement get out to the committe   and get more or less written in cement   and the reaction to what goe on at the meet and to veri current inform   i think we   re in a veri difficult posit   as soon as the statement get put to bed  then incom data can   t be reflect in it and what happen at the     meet is veri  veri hard to reflect there   so i think we need to recogn that that tension  which   will never actual be resolv  is there as we tri to get the statement word out earlier and earlier
the critic issu is   do we know someth   there   s go to come a  e when we can   t forecast and we have no idea what our next polici move will be   and to be forward look in that context is  obvious  inappropri
right   but i think if we said that  that would be use inform   if we said we don   t know which way rate are go to go next   that we   re not sure and it depend on the inform that come out   that would be use for the market to know
thank you  mr  chairman   first off  i accept your recommend in total  and i also apolog for make the point i made so late in the game   i wish i had been quicker to see the problem  and i would have said someth earlier   but i accept the argument that at this point we probabl ought to go with altern b   there are  as i see it  two huge issu in term of the economi   one is whither person save and the other is whither inflat   we   ve talk a lot about those and hope we will have more inform on them in may   i think most peopl around the tabl agre with the fact that the revis in word that we have put in the balanc of risk statement today mean that we probabl can   t use that statement in may or at all ani more  so that issu will take care of itself   whether i was with don or not befor  i can   t rememb   laughter  but i do like someth like the statement in altern c now   i   ve never been uncomfort with the    measur pace    languag   i think it actual has serv us well  and i   m not sure i   m readi to get rid of it   a number of peopl around the tabl have said that various measur seem to be show a littl more stabil now  and i think that just could be due     part to the fact that we have tri to be a littl forward look in our statement   so i don   t want   to give that up   i don   t have a care thought on how we ought to be forward look  but i don   t want to give it up
just two comment  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend on the rate increas and on altern b after this extens discuss   i found the discuss veri help and  though it may have been a littl long  in my view it was use to have it   as for forward look statement  i person think that the balanc of risk statement has outliv it use   whether we should includ some other kind of forward look comment is someth that at this point i   m agnost about   i   d like to hear more discuss and comment about that  and hope we   ll have an opportun to talk about it at the may meet   on a process point  i think get the draft statement out to the committe befor the bluebook is a construct step   i don   t want to build this into a bureaucrat procedur  but i think it would be help to have a chanc to see the comment made by other member of the committe on that initi draft   i  too  express concern about the phrase    appropri polici action      i believ it was last friday   but there was littl  e for look further at possibl revis   so i just think it would be help if we had a chanc to see what other peopl had to say about the initi draft of the statement
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the    basi point increas   i want to emphas a point that don kohn brought up   sinc our last meet  the forward market es  on the fund rate are up by    basi point   if we had perfect control over the term structur of     interest rate or all the forward forecast  in term of the impact on the    year rate  there   s a perfect   substitut between an extra    basi point now and an appropri move out in the futur   the advantag  i think  of push it out in the futur is that it keep the current increas on a veri predict path  which i believ should be a goal in and of itself   if we were to move    basi point   and this may come up in the futur   i think there   s an argument for do it when it   s a clear respons to some new piec of inform   but to do it almost out of the blue is go to creat a lot of uncertainti  and the market is not go to know whi we are do it or what to make of it if it   s not a clear respons to someth new in the inform set   so  given that there is this substitut between that and the extens of the    basi point increas  it seem to me we should work in the latter direct rather than take the market by surpris   i don   t know of ani good case where creat uncertainti for it own sake is advantag   i think we want to go veri much in the other direct   if at some point we move by    basi point without a clear case for do so  it is go to be veri hard to gaug or forecast the like effect and impact of that   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support the propos to rais the fed fund rate    basi point and i can accept the word in altern b   i must admit that governor     s amend   or mayb it was governor kohn   s amend  i   m not sure which    make some sens to me becaus i think that   s more descript than notion like    should be    or    with appropri polici      it   s just clearer and  if you will  more direct   but at this point  i   m fine with your recommend   go forward  i think the process question is an import one   it   s not just a matter of when do we get the page  if you will  it   s also a question of how   one respond and what   one know in anticip of the convers here   so  i would encourag the staff to work that through     a bit and make it a littl more transpar as we proceed and as the communic becom more   and more valuabl
thank you  mr  chairman   i also agre with the   point increas  and i know  there   s a lot of anticip look forward to the may meet   i look forward to it now with some trepid    laughter   i am fear that creativ may be epidem by the  e we get there   while i was not here in       i was here in       when we made signific chang in our statement in success meet  and that signific confus the marketplac   i would think that our experi has taught us that there is valu in take increment step in term of how we communic  particular as bill pool has suggest  when the economi is move in a manner that is signific predict   so  i would encourag us to keep that histori in mind when we think about the chang that we might make in may
mr  chairman  not that i   d like to reopen altern b  but i was wonder in paragraph   whether or not it would be appropri to refer to    appropri monetari polici    rather than just    appropri polici    becaus it   s obvious that not mani of you believ that either fiscal or trade polici is like be appropri any  soon
of cours  the public wouldn   t expect us to be comment on it  either
ani object to put    monetari    in there to qualifi that   hear no object  so order   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both the    basi point and altern b  as amend      in term of the dialogu we   ve just had about how we communic  while it   s veri pain    everi  e we go through one of these exercis  i believ this is one of the thing that we need to think through becaus the transpar that we   re build is veri import to the marketplac  when i look at the rational statement  i think they are send more messag as we do these press releas  in the brief  e that i   ve been on the board of governor and particip in the fomc meet  we seem to be stress when we get to the point where our direct of polici is chang  so part of this stress is over the transit languag   the more we seem to be lock into formula and word  the more difficult we make these transit   that is a factor in how we think about communic  we realli need to look at what seem right for one meet and how we get out of that as we move forward   mayb have these draft statement a littl earlier and be abl to think about them for more than a coupl day ahead of the meet will help   but i think longer term  pain as it may be  we do need to have discuss about transit languag  becaus that   s when the market is go to look for guidanc   and word like    appropri polici action    i don   t think communic a whole lot to the street   they may get us through today   s meet  but i think we have to be more transpar as we make the transit we need to make
presid  n
i  too  favor the    basi point increas  and i   m comfort with the languag of altern b   look forward  i do think we have an oblig to communic clear about polici prospect  to the extent that we can   and if this involv from  e to  e share our uncertainti with market particip  then so be it
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend of    basi    point and i support altern b   on the broad issu  i think we have to continu to attempt to have in our statement some forward look languag  as pain as it may be   i did not support the move toward have the minut come out earlier as a tradeoff   i know that was in some peopl   s mind  but i think in the statement itself some forward look languag about the economi is use   it is sort of modern day central bank practic  and anyth other than that  i think  is a step backward and is like to have a detriment impact not onli on our credibl but also on the market function   on the word    measur     as i said earlier  i think that   s condit upon the expect of inflat be relat well contain   and if that condit in fact turn out not to be true  then we could move more quick  and i don   t believ it would be undercut our commit  if that   s what it is  to    measur pace      to me it would just be a way of interpret the measur pace   on the process of get this languag out to us earlier  i look forward to see how the secretari manag to do that  and i will attempt to be as construct and help in that process as possibl   it   remind me that this year   mani of you didn   t follow this sport   there was a snowboard championship won by a    year old woman who did her world famous patent step call    the crippler      i expect to see a    crippler    come to monetari polici as   attempt to get this languag out that much earlier    laughter
mr  chairman  we   ve obvious begun an import convers   if it wasn   t evid befor  it is now  how pain and difficult this is go to be   i also appreci the remind of the need to be sure that we don   t unnecessarili shock the market as we tri to get our     word right   or as right as we can make them   so i look forward to the discuss of this next   meet  and i intend to vote for your recommend today
i also support the recommend for a    basi point increas in the fund rate   i was concern  when i first read on friday the languag in paragraph   in altern b  that it would be confus   the discuss today help me to understand the mean behind the languag  and i hope that we   ll be abl  through our minut  to explain that to the market  also  i understand that there will a three week lag  and we   ll see what happen in these three week   i   m also in the camp that believ the balanc of risk languag has been use  but i think it has serv it purpos and it   s  e to look at a differ approach   as we   ve note today  we should be abl to reli on the minut to communic more fulli  and i think the experi of earli releas of this next set of minut will help us to see if that is true   i would prefer to keep our statement on the shorter side   and less forward look   and reli more on the minut to communic
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the recommend   i think the addit of the phrase    appropri polici action    is actual use  becaus it will emphas that our forecast is condit on continu tighten rather than be an uncondit forecast   i agre with governor kohn and governor    among other  that it   s import to provid as much inform as we have about futur develop in the economi and polici  and i think perhap we should consid the altern c languag that   reinhart has suggest   final  i would just like to rais the issu of process   of cours  it   s veri use to get inform out as soon as possibl  but i think we have to recogn that the statement   have to     reflect the discuss at the meet and the condit of the economi   therefor  it need to be   understood that we have some flexibl to make chang nearer to the meet   i think that   s an import point to recogn   thank you
i  too  support your polici recommend  mr  chairman  and i can support the languag in altern b for now   also  i didn   t realiz i was under an oblig to communic about the languag befor the meet  and i apolog for confus the meet in that regard   i don   t think that we ought to pull inform of a forward look natur out of the statement on net  but i made the suggest i did about return to the balanc of risk assess statement  becaus my sens is that what   s label line   here is realli bear the weight of convey our sens about the futur   and i wouldn   t want to reduc the statement if it meant less transpar and a less forthcom communic with the public   i would point out that with this addit of the phrase    appropri monetari polici action    we   ve essenti put the nail in the coffin in the origin version of the statement   it now decid convey no inform about polici except that we want it to be appropri  which presum everyon alway knew    laughter   let me just comment about altern c   we   re in this evolv economi and communic with the public  and we expect certain reaction of them and they expect us to have polici evolv and react in a certain way   altern c is a zero probabl event  and i   m not quit  sure i see the valu of communic by describ a counterfactu futur that is so far from realiti   i think we can find other way to convey a sens of what look like to us go forward
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend to rais the    feder fund rate    basi point   i can also support altern b  although i have signific discomfort with the balanc of risk statement in line     i agre with presid     s comment that it has now been made essenti meaningless and can   t stay there long   i would simpli echo the opinion given by mani peopl around this tabl that it is veri import that we continu to communic our view and what we know about futur polici   i like the line   way of do that   obvious  we have to chang the languag as circumst chang and devis at some point an altern to    measur     but write an english sentenc or two to explain where we think polici is go is  i think  the best thing to do   and i think we need to do that even when we get to the point where the expect is that polici will remain unchang and we will be watch news to decid where we go from there   i   ve never been a fan of the balanc of risk statement   i know there have been a number of  committe that have tri to look at how to revis it   i suppos it   s worth do that again  but my sens is   i agre with presid     that it is fatal flaw   but i believ that communic is veri import and we should tri to communic in a less formula way
i support your recommend to move    basi point  and i support altern b as describ here   actual  i think it   s a pretti good statement  consid the altern    laughter   it   two import thing in that it convey an evolut in our signal in two respect   it acknowledg the chang in the outlook in import dimens  and it convey more qualif and condit on our seren in a way that introduc more uncertainti   i think it   s also desir that it   so in a nice  relat delic way  and i believ it   s a pretti good outcom   again  relat to the altern      it   s less clear to me what is go to make sens at the next meet   obvious  we   re    probabl go to want to look at a broader rang of chang to the statement  but i don   t know what those are go to entail   and i suspect there   s some risk that we   re go to find that we   re more comfort with a less dramat evolut than may be impli for the statement   let me make one comment on the minut   there   s a risk that the minut  if they look more like a transcript  would suggest that we were all over the map  with a veri thin consensus regard anyth about how to craft a signal for monetari polici   to me that would not do justic to the committe and the discuss   i think the minut would be best design   i know we can   t massag them ex ant   if they just acknowledg the realiti that we want to take a look at a number of differ dimens about the signal when we conven in may and if they convey some of our motiv for want to look at that   i think that can be done without go so far as to suggest that our view are all over the map on this and that we   re fundament uncomfort
we do have an inher contradict in have the minut discuss how the minut are go to be phrase    laughter   presid
presum  we   d not address that too much in the minut  we can leav it to the transcript that will be releas five year from now   i   m in agreement with the    basi point   as i said befor  i can go along with keep altern b the way it is   i have some concern about it  and i   m not alon  but i think we   ve spent enough  e on that   i want to address  howev  this issu that has been rais about the balanc of risk statement  just preparatori to our may discuss   i think we should look at the  e period from the middl of      to now as be a veri differ  almost uniqu  period   at least it is in the    or    year that i   ve been around the feder open market committe   we knew with some certainti that     we were at a place where the fed fund rate and interest rate at the short end   everywher on the   curv  in general   were at histor low   we knew that there was an incred degre of uncertainti from a lot of thing   and we knew that wherev neutral was  as my colleagu presid santomero said at one point  it was abov where we were   so the direct of the path for polici was clear  and we could convey that with some level of certainti   in my year on the committe  that is a rare event   we some  know with a reason degre of certainti our like next move  but we don   t know what polici will be six or eight month down the road   we can   t confirm the cours of the fed fund curv   so  if we say what our polici action was and whi we did it  i think that has enough forward content to it   if one look at the statement of the late     s  befor we got into the balanc of risk assess  they had enough forward look content to them   we could add or subtract from that  depend on where we are  but that would keep it short and simpl   we wouldn   t have six or seven sentenc that we   d have to mix and match in order to come up with someth that  individu   we feel comfort with  in my view we need to think about our communic with the outsid world as a broad rang of thing   we have tes oni  we have speech  we have an earlier releas of the minut  and we have our announc   we have a whole rang of vehicl to use to help us communic   the announc after the meet  sn   t have to do everyth all in one place  and sinc it   s come out in a veri  e way  i think it   s better to make it short and give it a littl bit of forward context   i   d say as much as need to tell whi we took the action we did but then leav it at that   that to me would be the best approach   unless it   s absolut necessari  as it has been over the last year and a half or more  to say someth that   s more forward look
