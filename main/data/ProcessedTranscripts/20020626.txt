our forecast for the rest of  the year  along with our forecast as of the may meet   the desk react to the strong growth in currenc by step up the pace of our outright purchas for the system open market account  soma    so far this year we have acquir about     billion in outright purchas of treasuri   the bottom panel graph for the period from      to date our total outright purchas of secur   the breakdown depict there show net addit to soma in the blue bar while the gray bar reflect purchas necessari to offset redempt caus by our guidelin on singl issu hold   dure the past few year of declin issuanc by the treasuri  the desk frequent could not roll over the full amount of matur proceed and therefor had to acquir other secur to offset the drain caus by the secur be redeem   i want to make three point about this chart   first  the need for      as a whole will be quit substanti   we forecast that soma will grow by about     billion this year   second  the chang fiscal pictur has caus the treasuri to increas issuanc  as a result  we have had no redempt so far this year and don   t expect ani for the remaind of the year   and final  with soma have grown in size from about      billion to over      billion in the past few year  the current     billion leeway to increas the portfolio dure the intermeet period continu to shrink as a percentag of soma   s now larger size   sever  e this year we have near hit the upper limit of the leeway  particular in long intermeet period such as the one just conclud   the desk has manag to remain within the current limit  and in the medium term i expect we can continu to do so   still  given the expect growth of currenc and in turn of soma   s portfolio  this limit will becom increas bind   therefor  i expect to return at a futur meet to request an increas in the intermeet leeway to a level higher than     billion   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period  i will need a vote to ratifi the domest oper
question for dino   if not  vice chair
move approv of domest oper
without object  they are approv   i believ that you   ve all gotten a memorandum request the committe   s approv of author for the new york bank to enter into agreement with other reserv bank for the conduct of open market oper in an emerg   if anyon has ani question  pleas rais them   i didn   t expect ani  so i presum that the request is approv without object   we now move to our staff brief on inflat   the present will be made by art rolnick    robert  and dave lebow  in that order
mr  chairman  i realiz that typic when i give talk like this i   m  requir to give a disclaim   these are not the view of the feder reserv bank of minneapoli  it board of director  or the board of governor
includ yourself    laughter
in this case  i   m hope they may becom the view of those organ   the titl of my talk is    are phillip curv use for forecast  inflat      year of debat      it is base on work that our reserv bank publish last year in our quarter review   befor turn to the packag of materi that was distribut  which i hope you all have  i would like to make a few introductori remark   then we will go through the handout   at the heart of monetari polici discuss is a view that there is a stabl relationship between unemploy and inflat   such a relationship is embed in the board staff   s model and impli that low unemploy today will mean futur  inflat tomorrow   this view of unemploy and inflat is base on what has becom known as the phillip curv   inde  some of the lead econom textbook today tout the phillip curv as one of the key principl in econom  nevertheless  the convent view of the reliabl of the phillip curv has been debat in academia for over forti year   recent work by ucla professor andrew  atkeson and lee ohanian  former staff economist at the minneapoli fed  conclud that the debat is over   on both theoret and empir ground  the phillip curv fail   the unemploy inflat correl is not stabl  and unemploy is not a use indic for forecast inflat   what i   d like to do now is to take you through the handout   page   highlight the three point that i want to make       the phillip curv hasn   t been stabl      the unemploy rate is not use for predict inflat  and     what we can say is that  in the long run  money growth is a reliabl predictor of inflat   page   is titl    the phillip curv  the u s  experi                 and page   show the phillip curv from      to      that mani of us grew up with   i rememb graduat school under walter heller when he would present these data and make the argument that this was not just a correl but obvious a veri strong correl that look rather convinc   furthermor  he and other   paul samuelson  for exampl    argu that there was an exploit tradeoff between inflat and unemploy and that inde it was up to policymak to pick the right point on that curv   we  spent a lot of  e argu about where we should be on that curv  about the cost of inflat versus the cost of unemploy   but if you recal  and some of you may  there was a fair heat debat join by  milton friedman  who argu that there wasn   t an exploit tradeoff between inflat and unemploy   he believ that if policymak tri to exploit that    materi use by mr  rolnick are append to this transcript  appendix     relationship  it would shift and inde might disappear   if you turn to page    you will see that  in fact  that is what happen as polici chang and we confront the inflat of the     s and onward   one would have a hard  e find what i   ll call the old phillip curv relationship between inflat and unemploy in that period  if anyth  in the     s the relationship went the other way  and some peopl were say that it look as though we got high inflat but also high level of unemploy   nevertheless  a number of economist weren   t go to give up on the phillip curv  and inde   if you   ll turn to page     a new phillip curv emerg between      and        the new phillip curv was now a relationship between unemploy and chang in inflat   this led to the concept of the non acceler inflat rate of unemploy  which we all call the nairu   the idea behind that concept is that  if unemploy fall below the nairu  the economi will be heat up and that will caus inflat to acceler   altern  if unemploy rise and the economi get weak  then inflat will deceler   if you look at the data from      to      you can see a relationship like that   it convinc mani that there was someth to the nairu concept and that onc again unemploy would be use in understand inflat   again the debat continu   professor robert luca argu that with this conceptu framework there was a problem with polici   his argument was that it might be true that  if polici is high variabl and inflat is hard to predict  we can get real effect and a new type of phillip curv   that is  becaus unexpect chang in inflat are difficult to deciph and we don   t know whether those chang involv a relat price chang or a rate of chang in inflat  there can be real effect   but in his model he show that if polici were to stabil and if inflat were to come down and stabil  then this relationship should also disappear   and that   s what we find   as you can see on page    the so call new phillip curv becom less visibl in the year between      and      as we were bring inflat down   as inflat becom more predict and as polici becom more predict  it no longer appear that there is a nairu that tell us much about where inflat is go   so  as i   ve note on page    my first point is that the phillip curv has not been stabl   you might quarrel with this   i   ve taken some veri simpl view of the phillip curv  you might take some more sophist view   you might not use unemploy  you might want to use a broader measur of econom activ   but  i   m go to assert that whatev the measur use  we   re go to find the same problem over this period   when we have tri to look at more sophist phillip curv  we found that they are not stabl over this period   let me turn now to the question that the author  atkeson and ohanian  pose more direct   some economist still insist that the phillip curv may be stabl enough and that unemploy  therefor  can still be use for predict inflat   so the author suggest a test  and their test rais this question   can the nairu base model forecast better than a nave model   what do they mean by a nave model  as shown on page     their definit is simpli that a nave model is one in which inflat over the next period is predict to be equal to inflat over the previous period   not a veri high hurdl and obvious a veri unsophist model   on the question of whether nairu base model can do better  page    provid a pictur view of their answer  which is    no      they compar a nave model to the nairu base board staff model   and also to the philadelphia fed   s survey of  profession forecast  which we think is nairu base   and one can see that the predict are rough the same   they went on to evalu a host of other nairu base model  includ mani base on work done by mark watson and jame stock who have done a tremend amount of write and work on nairu base model  so the author look at a larg assort of those model       of them   to evalu them in term of whether they predict inflat better than a nave model   page    convey the basic idea under their method of evalu   a better forecast model has smaller averag forecast error  right   the author    measur of success for a model  then  is the ratio of the averag error of a nairu base model versus the averag error of a nave model   the nairu model win if the measur is less than     it lose if it   s greater than     so it   s a veri direct test  and i would argu that it   s not a veri high hurdl   the author take a look at the stock and watson general version of     differ nairu base model and comput these ratio   you   ll see on page      and this chart need some explan   how the nairu model did   what we   ve done here is to show the rang of that ratio   again  if the ratio is over    the nairu model is lose   take the record with respect to the model    predict of core cpi  for exampl  one of the inflat variabl the model are tri to predict   the question ask is  base on that ratio  how mani of the nairu model have lower averag forecast error   the answer was none   for all of them the ratio was abov     the author look at the forecast of cpi and found that one or two of the nairu base model actual tie the perform of the nave model   they look at the pce deflat and could find one nairu base model at most that did as well predict that variabl as the nave model   so  look at the perform of a varieti of nairu base model in forecast three differ major indic of inflat  the nairu model could not beat the nave  model   that   s the summari of that page  and it make the second point i want to convey   not onli has the phillip curv been unstabl  it is not use for predict inflat when measur against a nave model   so the conclus that i draw from much of the work of atkeson and ohanian is that there are problem with predict high frequenc inflat   or what is known as short run variat in inflat   if we use unemploy   we   ve learn that that is also the case if we tri use the money suppli   even differ measur of the money suppli   we   ve had troubl use a money suppli measur to predict inflat for a long  e  and that is one of the reason this committe has move away from  place heavi emphasi on money growth in it polici decis   nevertheless  we do know  base on various type of evid  that over a long period of  e money growth caus inflat   there are a number of differ statist i could have use to make this point  the one i   m go to show you on page    and    happen to be my favorit   it is base on the experi of nineti four countri from      to      averag over twenti five year period   it is work that was done by warren weber of our staff and georg mccandless  one of our visit economist   and it is work that was cite by robert luca in his nobel address regard one of the clearest fact we have in econom  which is this long run relationship between money and inflat   again  we recogn that it is difficult to say anyth accur about short run movement in inflat   but we can be fair  confid that  over the long run  countri or their central bank that print too much money are go to caus high inflat   that is my third point  as state on page      that  in the long run  money growth is a reliabl predictor of inflat   let me sum up with a few conclud remark   the work that we have publish on the phillip curv is consist with a number of articl and research paper by other in the system   the new york fed  the cleveland fed  the chicago fed  and the board have all publish paper that are consist with the find of atkeson and ohanian   i think the bottom line is that the research call into question the use of unemploy to predict inflat in the short run   final  let me say that  ex post  one can alway find explan for movement in inflat  that may be a veri use exercis for a number of reason   but it   not chang the result that i   ve present here   mr  chairman  those are my comment and i   d be happi to answer question
art  is there evid that  in the long run  inflat is a reliabl predictor of money growth
well  we have a theori  the quantiti theori   as well as a number of other general equilibrium theori   that say money caus inflat
rememb  we also have a theori that say that the nairu work
right  a theori
so we   re test now to determin what conceptu framework is conson with the fact   clear  the correl that you show in and of itself
the correl i show is a correl   i don   t think we ever prove a theori   the best we can do is to say that we have a theori and these data are consist with the theori   in this case  quantiti theori and a number of general equilibrium model say that an increas in the money suppli will caus inflat  and we have this correl in the data that is consist with that theori   are you say that we could have theori in which we predict that inflat will caus an increas in the money suppli   i guess we could invent some
sure   you can make the hypothesi that inflat increas demand for money and the central bank cave in to that demand  mr  rolnick  right  absolut
so the question is
did they cave
no   but we do have statist techniqu that can infer which variabl is lead if there are lead involv
we   d have to get chris sim here to discuss whether those techniqu are good enough to determin causal   i think that   s hard to do   even with the best statist techniqu we have  it is difficult to get causal
the relationship is not causal   it   s basic lead associ  and that   s essenti what we   re tri to determin   i   m not argu the opposit  i   m just say that if our basic purpos is to draw infer from the data  we have to distinguish between when we construct a hypothesi and conclud result from it and  on the other hand  whether or not the data fit the hypothesi or are a mere inconveni if they don   t  other question   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   this articl that the minneapoli fed has publish is obvious a veri interest one  and i think it is a  e remind to all of us how difficult it is to forecast inflat   after that research was done  our staff did some further work on the minneapoli result  and the result of our research were report in our econom perspect public in the first quarter of this year   so i thought it would be help if i describ our find  which in some respect differ from what the minneapoli studi found  the first point relat to the use of the phillip curv in policymak   the minneapoli studi  of cours  talk about the magnitud of inflat   the impact of the phillip curv in this type of analysi on the magnitud of inflat   but if we chang that and talk about the direct of inflat  actual the result differ quit signific becaus the nave model obvious assum no chang in inflat go forward  so it  sn   t help us at all in term of predict the direct for inflat   but if we use the phillip curv model  they do   at least the analysi that we   ve done show that if one goe out over either a twelv month period or a twenti four   month period  the phillip curv model in seven out of the ten case     percent of the  e    accur predict the direct of inflat go forward   so from a polici standpoint  that   s not inconsequenti  it   s of some benefit  second  the period use in the minneapoli studi       to       is a period when there was some structur chang  as was point out in the board staff   s studi    there realli was a chang in the way our central bank approach inflat   we becam much more anti inflat in the     s and the     s than we were befor  and that is like to have influenc the behavior of inflat   so to some extent then  the poor perform of these inflat forecast model that are es  with data go back to the     s is not surpris   if we look at the phillip curv model in the      to      period  right after the chang in monetari polici  they don   t do well   but if we break the period differ and look at the interv from      to       they actual do well in forecast inflat  much as they did in the period prior to       the third and last point i   d mention is that this studi look onli at forecast over a twelv month period   when one look out over a twenti four month period  the phillip curv model do better than the nave model   so clear  there are limit to these phillip curv type of model  but i wouldn   t discard them complet   i think there is some benefit to policymak from these type of approach
i   m veri familiar with that studi  and i think it was an excel studi in a number of way   let me point out that the author of that work found  too  that the phillip curv was veri unreli and was not stabl   they had their reason for claim it wasn   t stabl ex post  ex ant there was no such suggest in the literatur that the phillip curv was go to shift the way it did other than by those who argu that phillip curv are inher unstabl in the first place   so noth that was shown in that studi suggest that the phillip curv are stabl  second  they use a turn point analysi   a differ metric  as you note   to tri to determin turn point rather than the measur of inflat chang   they don   t show that that give a stabl relationship either   in fact  that is also a relationship that chang over  e   the basic messag of the minneapoli studi was that these relationship are not stabl  and that is the case whether one is look at measur or turn point   it is true that for certain interv one can forecast veri well with the phillip curv   how do we know what kind of interv we   re  in   how do we know when the interv chang   what theori tell us when it chang  potenti  policymak can make larg mistak if we   re in a period where the abil of the model to predict accur is chang and they don   t know that   so i think the argument come out of the minneapoli fed studi is that to be confid   whether you want to use a measur of detect turn point or not   you need a stabl relationship   and until you find that stabl relationship  you   re face quit a bit of uncertainti   as you point out  the success rate in predict turn point was    percent   i don   t know if that   s high enough   are we go to tell the congress next year that we   re    percent sure that inflat is go to declin   is that good enough   i would think we   d want a success rate closer to    or    percent and we   d want a relationship that was stabl   so i   m not sure  given the evid we have  that we would be veri confid in either type of metric   that is  the measur of inflat or it turn point  there is still a lot of work to be done to be abl to argu that we could confid predict a  turn point in the rate of inflat
i don   t think the scienc of econom is ever confid in that type of predict   it   s certain not at the point where we can confid predict that   to me it   s a question of what is help to the policymak   and if in seven out of ten  e we are abl to point out the direct of futur inflat  i   d view that as help
just rememb that in a sampl of ten  that    has a veri larg varianc
but i think it   s better than    percent
no  i think there is a question of whether it is statist better than    percent   in this case there were not enough observ to do a veri good job of test  whether that result was ani better statist than a flip of a coin   so while i think there may be someth there  you don   t have enough observ to say much confid on that method of turn point
my point is that i wouldn   t discard it out of hand   i think it is still someth for us to look at as policymak  it provid some use input
further question for arthur
art  your point   suggest that the model you would want to substitut for the phillip curv is a quantiti theori type of model   the question i have is  with such a model  in what way would you expect the polici process of this committe to chang
i thought you were go to ask me an easi question    laughter
well  i think i know what milton friedman   s answer would be   but what  are you suggest that we do
all i   m suggest is that our current knowledg is that  for high frequenc observ or short term  it   s veri difficult to predict inflat   for the long term i think we can do a pretti good job
long term use what
use quantiti theori   but if we   re interest in short run movement in the economi  i think the quantiti theori has not done veri well   after all  that   s the reason we don   t use monetari aggreg for short run predict of inflat   so as long as we   re concern about short run movement in inflat   and i   m talk a year to two year   all i   m say is that i think you have to continu to forecast but you might as well use a nave model for forecast inflat now until you find someth statist better   if you think unemploy is go to do it  i believ this evid suggest that you should be worri about use that construct   in fact  when the unemploy rate fell well below the so call nairu for the last three or four year  it was fortun that this committe did not respond to that   and i think for good reason   the messag from this evid is that look at the unemploy rate relat to a nairu is not a veri effect way of predict inflat   if the committe had believ it was  i think it would have made some serious mistak
it sound to me as though we would have a lot fewer meet
may i make just one point here about art   s work   i   m veri sympathet to presid     s point about not discard this basic under structur  but at the same  e i   m certain will to conced art   s point that in the last fifteen year the unemploy rate has not had as much predict power for futur inflat as it did previous  i don   t view the enterpris of the  book forecast as an effort to go out and  in some sens  find the most parsimoni structur upon which to forecast the economi   in fact  i   m not sure our big     stochast equat model could do much better than a   or   equat vector autoregress   and i will admit that there are probabl a number of peopl on our staff who would be quit thrill to write the art rolnick  book   it would be one page and two sentenc and would say someth like     pce inflat was     percent in        and we project pce inflat to be     percent in            laughter   but i don   t think that approach would necessarili provid you as policymak with the kind of inform that you need to grappl with the admit huge uncertainti you face about the economi   art said he   d like you folk to have    percent confid befor you talk to the congress about the econom outlook  if you could get to    percent confid  i   d say you should call it a good day and probabl quit   one of the reason for move away from a nave approach and more toward the complex that we present in the forecast is that that complex allow you to see where tension begin to aris in the project   and inde  our experi in the late     s is a good exampl   it wasn   t just that product was perform better than a simpl  e seri model of product would suggest   it was that we were see a pattern of error across a larg number of equat that suggest to us that some import aspect of the structur of the economi were chang in way that you need to respond to as policymak   if we had been forecast with art   s nave model   or even with one that was a bit more complic but still parsimoni   i   m not sure you would have been abl to identifi exact what was go on as quick as was possibl from analyz the pattern of our forecast error   in our case  we were see stronger product  less inflat  more consumpt  more invest  and a stronger stock market   it was all those piec taken togeth that provid a context for you to understand what was happen  at the end of the day  if the congress would be satisfi with your use a twenti five   year move averag of money growth to explain what your polici was go to be for the next year or two  i guess that would be great   and person if you tell me i should be forecast inflat twenti five year henc  i   ll be happi to use art   s regress   i   m plan to be here for onli anoth ten year  so i   d be happi to forecast twenti five year into the futur   laughter   but i don   t think that is  as yet  a viabl substitut as an altern mechan for forecast inflat  inde  one of the interest thing about model inflat has been that in the last twenti five or thirti year we economist have not as a profess made a huge amount of progress   mani of the basic model that peopl are use today to forecast inflat were alreadi evid in the      or      econometr of price determin volum sponsor by the feder reserv board   that had bob luca   s origin work and the work of otto eckstein and bob gordon   and  as art note  we   re still debat mani of those issu   some think we   re make some progress  but i suppos i   m skeptic  i think art make a veri good point about the reliabl of forecast   in fact  a coupl of year ago we submit to the committe a number of paper that look at question about how to make monetari polici in period of signific uncertainti   we suggest then that you ought to put less weight on the forecast   as you did  i believ   and pay attent to what is actual happen   that procedur probabl was wise and  i think  use   now    and   will discuss short the issu that we have been struggl with and how we   ve been tri to explain what has gone on recent   but in term of our be abl to provid a context or an explan for the behavior of the economi  we still feel strong that the unemploy rate is an import transmiss mechan into monetari polici   it   s not the onli one  and it may not even be the princip one  but we believ it   s an import one
i could make a faceti remark and stop there  mr  chairman  to the effect that art   s present is particular attract if you have not devot mani year and much energi to get a phd in econom   the more import lesson from the various analys that are use  howev  is that   as   has point out i think quit well   they show us what we don   t know   i have long felt that in public polici it is import to know what you don   t know becaus then you   re not like to go happili along make polici decis base on a view that you know more than you do   i do think that historian probabl will say that one of the great perform of this committe was in the         period when we knew that some quit unusu thing were happen   the staff did not pretend to say that all of our model were work  they were veri straightforward in say that the model were not work and that  therefor  we had to look at more figur and perhap place greater weight on anecdot inform   but i do believ that it   s import for us to keep dig and dig into these various theori to see what we know or what combin of theori can be put togeth to guid the committe in make decis   i am in the happi posit of be abl to say that i can   t think of a decis we   ve made  at least in the nine year i   ve been here  that with the full brillianc of hindsight i would like to go back and chang   that   s all i have to say  especi if you   re given to intellectu honesti  which i hope we all are   so i think the imperfect methodolog we   re use has serv us rather well
i think there   s one hypothesi that has not been shut down  yet  certain not over the last five to ten year  and that is that the econom structur that drive this economi is under continu chang   that is  we don   t have a set of fix linear coeffici that abstract from realiti and duli respond with a reason simul or project of what the economi is do   one of the difficulti of have a simpl model  if inde there is a continu evolv structur that we have to deal with  is that a simpl model will go wrong and we won   t know that it went wrong for quit a long period of  e  i think the point that dave   make is realli quit relev becaus we have learn that the under structur of coeffici that was built into the fed model  say  ten year ago was not depict realiti   the simul come off that model were creat veri peculiar result   and inde nave forecast   in the sens of mere let the system run without ani systemat endeavor to alter the add factor   was produc forecast that were just veri clear wrong   what that say  obvious  is that there is someth wrong in the under structur that is generat the forecast  i have a suspicion that until we can find some signific  stabl set of relationship that seem to captur someth fundament and unchang in the economi  we will have no choic but to move to look at a wide varieti of data and inform  as the vice chair said  from those veri dispar type of evid we can tri to make infer about the economi  and the more data we look at  the more we will be abl to infer about the under structur that is govern econom activ in that period   a lot of peopl out there are ask whi we can   t come up with someth simpl and straightforward   the phillip curv is that  as is   taylor   s structur   the onli problem with ani one of these construct is that  while each of them may be simpl and even help  if a model  sn   t work and we don   t know for quit a while that it  sn   t work  it can be the sourc of a lot of monetari polici error   that has been the case in the past  i hope we can find some stabl structur out there   i suspect that we will not   i think we   re go to find that the under evolut of our societi is such that what we now presum to be stabl coeffici are inde variabl   i   m not say that they are random in variat   i   m say that there is a systemat variat  but we don   t know what it is   or at least we don   t know as yet   at some point along the line we may be abl to infer what that is and find way of fit it to the economi with coeffici defin as function of other coeffici  the mathemat are awesom  as you all know   and the number crunch capabl of comput today provid the possibl of make veri complex mathemat relat simpl becaus you don   t have to bother think   you just push a button and let the model run   that may be the solut to some of our problem   but my view reflect the same caution that i think both dave   and bill   rais   presid
well  i have a much less philosoph approach to this  although my thought are veri much in line with your and dave   s as well as bill   s and     s   it   s not surpris to me  as complex as our economi is  that more than one factor might be respons for chang in inflat  the direct of inflat  chang in relat price  chang in the labor forc  and the kind of challeng that labor is go to face   that is not startl at all   and particular in an environ like the     s in which we   ve been success in keep inflat down  it is hard surpris that a nave forecast for onli a year in the futur is a pretti good way of es  inflat becaus inflat hasn   t chang that much  thank good   that   s becaus we   ve been reason success with our polici   i think if one went back to the year      through      and tri nave forecast use contemporan unemploy rate and inflat rate  the number would be quit differ
further question for arthur   if not  let   s turn to   robert
thank you  mr  chairman   our present this afternoon  entitl    explain low inflat sinc the mid     s    reflect joint work with flint brayton and   lebow and will be present by myself and     as shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit  the rate of unemploy fell through the late     s  eventu reach a level not seen in thirti year   nevertheless  core consum price inflat   shown at the upper right   remain in the     to   percent rang throughout this period   this outcom struck mani observ as be at odd with the view that low unemploy necessarili push up inflat   the object of our brief today is to provid an explan for these develop   to do this  we find it help  as summar in the middl panel  to step back and ask whether chang may have been occur in the economi over a longer span of  e that may have alter the inflat process   we then focus on the recent past and ask whi inflat remain so low in the late     s  when unemploy was also low  final  in light of the chang that we identifi as be import  we evalu the likelihood that the recent conjunct of low inflat and low unemploy can be repeat in come year   by our reckon  three factor account for much of the recent experi of  simultan low inflat and low unemploy  as list in the lower panel of  the exhibit   first  a chang in the way monetari polici has been conduct over the past two decad  compar with the     s and     s  may have reduc the short run respons of inflat to resourc util   this factor is a relat small part of our overal explan for whi inflat has remain so low   the second factor is the pickup in product growth that start in the mid     s   as output per hour advanc more rapid  hour compens respond onli gradual  and the pressur on price from unit labor cost temporarili wane   this element is the largest part of our explan for the late     s experi   look to the futur     materi use by mr  robert and mr  lebow are append to this transcript  appendix     the influenc of the pickup in product growth on inflat should diminish over  e as hour compens adjust more fulli to the fa  trend growth in output per hour   last  structur develop in labor market may have caus the natur rate of unemploy today to be about    percentag point lower than in the mid     s   these effect are like to persist   i should note that our present   not discuss the influenc on recent inflat of movement in the price of import  energi  and food   although these standard    suppli shock    variabl have at  e had signific effect on the year to  year pattern of inflat  we see their net contribut to the good inflat perform of the past sever year as be relat small   the framework for our analysi  the frb us model of inflat dynam  is sketch out in exhibit     this model and other like it help inform the staff  project   in this framework  inflat  ï   is a function of lag inflat  expect futur inflat  ï e   the differ between the unemploy rate  u  and it natur rate  un   relat price shock  such as movement in food  energi  and import  price   and unit labor cost   in frb us  household and busi form expect of inflat base on their knowledg of the structur of the economi  includ the manner in which monetari polici is conduct   the factor we examin fit into this model as follow   first  for reason we will expand on short  chang in the conduct of monetari polici alter the influenc of the unemploy rate on expect inflat   second  chang in labor product growth affect inflat through unit labor cost   final  the labor market develop we highlight influenc the natur rate of unemploy direct and therebi alter the amount of inflat impetus associ with ani given level of the actual unemploy rate   although econom slack  as measur by the gap between the unemploy  rate and the natur rate of unemploy  clear affect inflat in this framework  the equat also make clear that unemploy is by no mean the onli determin of inflat   accord to the frb us model  sinc the mid     s  movement in this unemploy gap account for onli about    percent of the variat in consum price inflat  when measur in term of it year to year chang   this es  includ the direct influenc of unemploy on inflat shown in the equat as well as the indirect influenc that is transmit through the behavior of expect inflat   the top panel of exhibit   show the chang in inflat from one four quarter period to the next plot against the unemploy rate over the past forti year  with a split at the end of        in each panel  we present the simpl regress line  as you can see  the line are downward slope  indic that period of high  unemploy tend to be associ with declin inflat   but it is also clear that the point in the post      period are clu  in a narrow rang than in the           period   and as art rolnick note earlier  the averag slope of the relationship is consider shallow in the post      period than in the earlier period   inde  the slope fall by about half   the chang in the relationship between inflat and unemploy could have occur for mani reason  but we find it plausibl to attribut at least some of it to a chang in the way that monetari polici has been conduct   as highlight in the first bullet point of the lower panel  mani studi suggest that sinc the earli     s monetari polici has move more aggress to stabil the economi than it did in the     s and     s   in the staff   s frb us macroeconom model  such a chang in monetari polici reduc the sensit of inflat to unemploy by alter the way household and busi form their expect of inflat   in particular  under a more aggress polici  low unemploy is no longer as strong a signal of higher futur inflat  and so expect are better    anchor      base on simul of the frb us model  we find that a convent represent of this chang in polici would reduc the sensit of the chang in inflat to unemploy by about a third and thus would account for more than half of the reduct in the sensit seen in the top panel   other model impli similar reduct  although the precis result are sensit to the model use and the exact specif of the chang in polici   while the polici shift predat the low inflat episod on which our attent is focus  this  e mean that by the late     s the chang in polici had been in place long enough that it was like reflect in the expect format process   as a consequ  the low unemploy rate of the late     s induc less deterior in inflat expect  and thus in actual inflat as well  than would have been expect from the averag histor relationship between inflat and unemploy   it is import to keep in mind that policymak cannot    exploit    the new  lower sensit of inflat to the unemploy rate   if policymak were to respond to this lower sensit by move less aggress when unemploy fell below the natur rate  this revers to a less aggress polici would  over  e  alter the way in which expect are form  lead to an increas in the sensit of inflat to econom slack     lebow will now continu our present
exhibit   address the role of product in hold down inflat in the     s   in the long run  a fa  rate of product growth impli fa  growth of real wage and has no implic for inflat   but in the short to   medium run  we find evid that product   affect inflat   this occur becaus  in the equat we examin  hour compens respond onli gradual when product acceler   in our view  the slow reaction of compens stem in larg part from the cost that firm and worker face in acquir and process inform relev to set wage  as well as from other institut featur that  lead to inertia in wage more general   firm    and worker    decis about wage depend on percept about condit throughout the economi  and it may take quit a bit of  e for a chang in economywid product growth to work it way fulli into econom condit   the sluggish adjust of compens impli that unit labor cost rise less rapid and profit margin increas follow an acceler in product  therebi help to hold down price inflat   put differ  fa  product growth allow a lower unemploy rate to be consist with stabl inflat   although this effect may be quit long live  it is not perman   eventu the fa  pace of product growth becom fulli embed in wage set behavior  and product has no further effect on inflat   the blue line in the middl panel show an es  of structur product growth   that is  product growth abstract from pure cyclic movement that tend not to affect firm    price behavior   the measur shown here is similar  but not ident  to the staff es  of structur product growth built into the  book forecast   the red line show our es  of the effect this product growth has on the increas in compens per hour   for our analysi  the fundament observ is that  when product growth pick up  the associ compens increas lag behind   thus  when product growth increas in the     s  it took  e for this increas to becom incorpor in wage set  and increas in unit labor cost slow  as evidenc by the widen gap between the blue and red line   when product growth was declin in the     s  this process work in the opposit direct   the lower left panel present one way to describ the influenc of these product driven movement in unit labor cost on price inflat   the measur plot in the exhibit is the deviat in the unemploy rate from the long run natur rate that would be need to maintain stabl inflat in the face of these product effect   accord to these es   the slowdown in product growth in the     s generat upward pressur on inflat that would have requir a higher unemploy rate to offset   by contrast  in the     s  the product acceler allow a lower unemploy rate to be consist with stabl inflat  as we indic earlier  we would expect this effect of fa  product growth on inflat to be temporari  and the chart suggest that it may have about play itself out by now   howev  the staff has assum that a recoveri in capit format go forward will again boost structur product growth  in which case some  further benefici effect may occur for a while longer  befor eventu return to zero   although the evid in favor of these product effect is compel enough to persuad us of their import  we do not want to overst the strength of that evid   the lower right panel list some caveat   first  the speed with which chang in product growth influenc wage is veri uncertain   mani differ adjust speed fit the compens data about equal well yet have notic differ implic for the dynam of inflat   moreov  the adjust speed might not be constant and might have been affect by chang compens practic in recent year   the effect of uncertainti about this adjust speed  as well as uncertainti about the other relev paramet in our equat  is shown by the shade area in the bottom left panel  which present a    percent confid interv around our es    as can be seen  this confid rang is rather wide  furthermor  this confid interv underst the full amount of uncertainti  as it omit  among other thing  the sensit of our result to the measur of structur product use   in exhibit    we delin a number of recent labor market develop and their possibl implic for the natur rate of unemploy   the top panel group these develop in term of the direct of their like effect on the natur rate in recent year   while this list may be incomplet  it identifi mani of the key issu that research have explor   as note in the middl column  some of the more familiar factor that may have had import effect on the natur rate histor    such as the minimum wage  unemploy insur  and shift in the demograph composit of the labor forc   have had rough neutral effect in recent year   the left hand side of the middl panel of the exhibit present indic for a number of factor that may have push down the natur rate in recent year   two develop   the rise in the incarcer popul  shown as the   line  and the increas in the share of the work age popul collect disabl insur  the blue line   both work to reduc the natur rate for similar reason   both develop lead to the withdraw from the labor forc of individu who would otherwis have had abov averag rate of unemploy   the rise in employ at temporari help suppli firm   the red line   may cut both way in term of it effect on the natur rate of unemploy   on the one hand  the avail of job with temporari help firm may make it easier for some individu who would otherwis be unemploy to find work   on the other hand  some individu who might otherwis have had more stabl full  e job are now in the temporari help sector  where they may end up be unemploy between assign   on balanc  the unemploy lower effect probabl domin  but the net effect is like to have been small   worker insecur may have play a role in hold down wage increas in recent year  therebi allow unemploy to be lower than it otherwis would have been   the middl right panel show one survey base measur of worker insecur   this measur rose to a high level in the mid     s   it fell back in the boom labor market of the late     s but remain at an elev level  return again to the top panel and it left column  the fifth factor we list as possibl hold down the natur rate is the improv job match made possibl by the internet   while the internet has help mani worker find job   and help mani firm find worker   we suspect that the effect on unemploy so far has been small  at least in part becaus internet use is highest among better educ worker  who are less like to be unemploy   one factor that may have work to rais the natur rate in recent year is welfar reform   as shown in the bottom left panel  the number of famili receiv welfar has drop substanti sinc the mid     s   while survey indic that a larg major of former welfar recipi have found job  these survey also suggest that former welfar recipi are somewhat more like to be classifi as unemploy   that is  look for work   than when they were collect welfar   the bottom right panel summar the implic of these develop for the natur rate of unemploy   our assess   base on some rough calcul inform by the avail research on these effect   is that  demograph asid  these develop may have reduc the natur rate about    percentag point compar with the mid     s   as with most of the other result we are present today  there is a high degre of uncertainti around this calcul   and reason altern assumpt about the unemploy consequ of these individu develop could impli anyth from no chang at all in the natur rate to a reduct of as much as a percentag point   one reason we don   t believ the shift is much larger than    percentag point is that we have not observ larg  persist error in model of hour compens in recent year   if the natur rate had fallen more signific  not onli price inflat but also compens inflat would have been surpris low in recent year  and this has not been the case    your last exhibit show simul of the price and wage sector of the frb us model to quantifi the amount by which the shift in the conduct of monetari polici  a fa  rate of structur product growth  and favor labor market develop have held down core consum price inflat over recent year   the calcul involv compar the predict for core inflat from two simul  each of which start in      and run through the first quarter of this year   in the first simul  all three of the factor we have highlight today are includ   in this case  as indic by the red line in the figur at the top left  the simul has inflat fall from      to the present by about as much as inflat  on net  in fact declin   in the second exercis  the three factor are omit   that is  the pickup in  product growth is assum not to have occur  the    percentag point reduct in the natur rate is remov  and inflat expect are generat in a manner consist with the way monetari polici was conduct prior to the     s  the   line in the figur show the model   s predict that inflat  rather than fall  would have risen more than   percentag point   addit simul were run to calcul the contribut of each factor separ to the   percentag point differ between the most recent point on the   and red curv  which correspond to the first quarter of this year   as seen to the right  almost two third of the differ is due to the pickup in product growth  about one quarter to labor market develop that have lower the natur rate  and onli a small amount to the shift in monetari polici regim   of cours  we have emphas throughout this brief the uncertain natur of our analysi  and these es  must be taken in that spirit   as note in the middl panel  we believ that there are some clear connect between our analysi and the appar view of mani firm that they lack    price power    in the low inflat economi   this percept may be a natur consequ of the creativ destruct that has accompani the product acceler  becaus the benefit of product innov are not spread equal across firm  innov creat winner  such as wal mart  and loser  such as kmart   and the particip in the accompani competit  especi the loser  may natur view themselv as lack price power in this environ   furthermor  in our view  an acceler in product is like to be follow initi by a rise profit share as product move up ahead of compens and then a declin profit share as compens catch up and widen profit margin are compet away  the latter phase especi  which the data suggest has been under way in the past few year  may be perceiv as a period of declin price power   final  a lack of price power itself could arguabl have play a role in drive the acceler of product   greater competit associ with global  deregul  and low inflat may have contribut to an environ in which firm have less price power   this reduc price power could be a factor that spur firm to be especi aggress in seek new product enhanc technolog   look ahead  our analysi indic that part of the explan for the economi   s recent abil to experi both low inflat and low unemploy is like to continu and part of it may not   if monetari polici remain aggress  the smaller sensit of inflat to unemploy should continu   howev  this   not lower the rate of unemploy that is consist with stabl inflat   similar  in our view  an increas in the growth rate of product will not perman reduc the rate of unemploy consist with stabl inflat   the benefit for inflat from product may persist a while longer  howev  given the expect that capit deepen will pick up as invest rebound   moreov  we do not yet know whether the acceler of multifactor product has come to an end   of the three element that we have identifi as have led to the low inflat   low unemploy episod  the reduct in the natur rate associ with  various labor market develop is most like to have a durabl effect on the inflat unemploy nexus   thank you
go to exhibit    how are you fit those coeffici
those coeffici are es  on data for the last thirti five year
these are reduc form model
no  realli there   s a pair of equat   one for price inflat and one for wage inflat   that are es  togeth   we   re assum in the process of es  these two equat that expect are form in a manner consist with a view of how monetari polici oper to move the feder fund rate   built into that es  is a view that monetari polici was conduct in a differ manner in the     s and the     s then it has been more recent
as model by what
well  the specif way that we character monetari polici is in the  form of a    taylor rule    equat   a dynam form of the taylor rule that has a lag interest rate in it   we   re use differ coeffici in this taylor rule to character the two differ view
are you impos this on the model  or are you infer it  from the data
we are impos it on the model  but we are take our coeffici es  from studi that other peopl have done base on analyz the data   we are not do our own independ es
but this is structur on the basi of a number of independ submodel  effect   in endeavor to infer relationship and to build this system up you do so in a manner obvious in which you   re not test it in the macro sens   it is part of the fallout of an earlier system   in other word  you don   t confirm this by the data  you are draw infer from other research about the sign and relat size of coeffici and larg impos it on the structur that you have
to be clear  we   re impos coeffici onli as they relat to the conduct of monetari polici   but we do es  the other coeffici   for exampl  the beta and gamma that are explicit shown in the exhibit
so what is the size of beta
well  we have more than one lag on inflat  but if we sum up the individu coeffici on all the lag  beta would be about      i think
so it   s somewher between a first differ equat and a level equat in a sens
yes  though the answer to that   depend upon how inflat expect are form
that get to my last question   what proxi are you use  for that
well  we   re actual generat proxi ourselv from a small var model  one of the element of which is an equat for the feder fund rate in the form of a taylor rule type of equat that i describ earlier   so we   re not use survey data
that   s a point i don   t quit get   could you just explain it to me again
in the process of es  the wage price structur in the frb us model  we are actual generat our own proxi for expect inflat   and those proxi are the forecast that would be generat by a small var model of the economi  assum that embed in that small var model is a particular view of how monetari polici is form
what are the variabl in the var model that you   re use there
the feder fund rate  the gap between the unemploy rate and the natur rate  and the rate of consum price inflat
do you have ani ex post test on that model   art rolnick would argu that his data say that shouldn   t fit
well  one could ask whether that model is stabl  and certain
one could ask a lot of question    laughter
one could say that the interest rate equat in it is not stabl  reflect the shift in polici  and we do take account of that   and that   s realli the onli test we would appli   one could actual look closer at it
well  as long as we   re into that  i had a few question about your model  too   first  as i understand it  on un you take the demograph adjust that dave has talk about and incorpor them into the variabl   is that right   you take from outsid the relat price shock and unit labor cost you talk about and again just build that into the model   as for these es  coeffici  is it right to say that the ï e is like a first stage variabl   you put in that first stage equat and then it   s done so that the beta and the one minus beta sum to     that   s basic how you do it
that   s correct
okay   let me make a coupl of comment about art   s paper   first  i think there are two problem with use the  e period of the last fifteen year   one was mention by the staff and also by cathi    which is that  if the central bank is success in hold inflat close to  shall i say  a target  then ani coeffici is go to have veri small effect   that   s becaus essenti you are go to reduc all the systemat variabl from the right side and you   ll just have a seri of residu   so i think there is that problem  which i gather is be call the op  control problem   there is also anoth problem   let   s say there is still a phillip curv out there that monetari polici hasn   t total emascul   as is appar in your chart  the varianc of unemploy actual hasn   t been veri larg over the past fifteen year either  so one is go to have a littl more difficulti in es  the coeffici there   i don   t know if it   s bias up or down  but there has to be a signific variat in the independ variabl to be abl to es  a coeffici   so that might be an issu  too  the second point is that i wonder what you would have us policymak do   that   s the thought that occur to me when i read the paper that was circul   after all  we have to anchor inflat somehow  and if you don   t want us to use unemploy  what would you have us use   you   ve answer that in a way by say that you would go to a quantiti theori rule  which is fine   but i think you gave that a littl easier test   there you were just see if you could hit the target over a twenti five year period   and it strike me that it might be harder to hit the target one year ahead than twenti five year ahead  at least for the quantiti theori   so i   m not sure that you had a symmetr test for the two hypothes  one last comment on the whole meta issu  if you will   be a structur person  i side with the other who spoke befor in prefer what the board staff has done in exhibit    where the inflat process is broken up into differ compon   we look at expect and at product shock and whatev  which i think is better becaus in the long run we will learn more that way   and in my view the committe has been well serv by that
look at the second panel on your exhibit    where structur product growth was take off   with a drop off recent that is about typic of the reduct in product growth dure a recess   i would think that the improv product trend is still veri much aliv   the question  i think  is whi it took place  it seem to me that the lack of price power  which you suspect is at least part of the explan of what was drive the product improv  is in fact veri import   that   s especi the case for the improv in product that came from the use of inform technolog in the non tech sector   i think the main reason that peopl run firm were invest in such technolog is that in a global economi they simpli couldn   t rais price   they had to give some  increas in wage and benefit  and the onli way to avoid financ that out of profit was to invest in product enhanc and not share the benefit from that with the staff   it seem to me that the economi we will be look at in the forese futur   say  the next five  year   is go to be that same kind of economi   now  a littl of the disciplin may come off unless   can get the dollar strong again becaus clear a strong dollar enhanc that disciplin even more and made busi invest in improv in product   i think we   re still go to have a lot of that disciplin  and it will continu to be a big factor   you say that it may be long live but not perman  i   m old enough that perman  sn   t matter too much to me   so if it goe on for anoth five or ten year   and i think it   s like to   i believ it will serv the nation well
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain agre with the three factor that the staff has point to as have play a signific role in restrain inflat   but i do have a question about the weight assign to them in term of their relat import   and it seem to me that the recent experi of other develop countri might provid some interest inform for us   i say that becaus in the mid  to late     s other countri besid the unit state also experienc the puzzl combin of low and stabl inflat and declin unemploy rate  let me just pick two  though not arbitrarili  britain and canada   first of all  they both achiev low  relat stabl inflat and low rate of unemploy  which would suggest that perhap there is some common explan for countri that have experienc that  howev  those two countri did not see at all the kind of product pickup that we   ve seen in the unit state   but in these countri and other as well there was a shift in how monetari polici was conduct   i wonder  if you were to take a more intern perspect in this studi  whether it might not chang your view about what the relat weight of these factor might be in explain what was realli a global process
one comment i might have on that is that the weight we give to monetari polici in the experi of the last five year is associ with our notion that polici chang the sensit of inflat to the gap between unemploy and the natur rate   for monetari polici to receiv a bigger weight in our analysi there would have to have been a bigger gap between actual unemploy and what we es  is the natur rate for polici   s quantit effect to be dramat larger than we es    so that   s a more or less mechan explan of whi in our way of think we can   t give polici too much more weight   but obvious we have a varieti of uncertainti here  so we wouldn   t rule out a differ pars
thank you  mr  chairman   first a comment   microeconom principl  would have led me to think that a move from a high inflat environ to a low inflat environ would caus an increas in what we call product  though i don   t know how i would go about direct tri to test or reject that hypothesi   next i have a question  though i   m not sure it   s go to sound veri differ from the question that bob parri was just rais  certain we have data problem with the phenomenon that we call inflat   we have problem with the unemploy statist   who is count in the labor forc and who is count as not work   and clear we have problem with how we measur product   and as far as i know  the data measur problem are get wors not better   nevertheless  if we look at a cross section of currenc zone around the world  the similar in movement of what we measur as inflat is strike while the diverg in what we measur as product and  unemploy is equal strike   how would you explain that
i   m not sure we have an explan for that   one general point i could make is that although the chang in monetari polici is part of our stori  there   s noth that say that the chang in monetari polici   this speak to presid parri   s question as well   was the same across all countri   in some countri that had more of a histori of inflat than the unit state  the chang in monetari polici could have been more strike and thus had a larger effect   on the basi of the way head are nod  i think we all agre that take a more intern approach would be veri interest   but not have done that  i   m not sure that we have veri mani answer for you
mr  chairman  i don   t have ani question  just a coupl of comment   let me say first that i veri much enjoy work through both of these paper  they focus on issu that a lot of us have been deal with for heaven know how mani year  and i think they do shed some new light on the subject of inflat   for me the most interest  question  though  is what conclus one draw from the result of both set of studi   i   m talk first about the role that monetari polici play in bring the inflat rate down and stabil it and second about how we should conduct polici go forward in order to sustain the low inflat we have now  against that background let me make a coupl of comment about each paper   i thought art did a veri nice job of summar the atkeson ohanian paper   of cours  the main result is that  at least over the last fifteen year  phillip curv model don   t forecast inflat ani better than a nave model   at first blush that might seem discourag from the standpoint of someon conduct monetari polici  especi if the policymak depend on those kind of forecast model   it might seem to suggest that inflat has a life of it own and  if we can   t forecast it  how can we possibl hope to control it over  e   but on the contrari  i think on reflect these result can be interpret as evid of the critic import and construct role of monetari polici in stabil inflat   this just repeat the point that i think cathi was get at and that ned made also  though i may be say it a bit differ   if you imagin a world where the fed is stabil inflat perfect  then in that situat we would be move the fund rate in exact the way we would have to move it to offset the effect of a rang of macroeconom variabl and temporari shock on inflat   and henc none of these variabl would have ani predict content for inflat becaus essenti we would be offset those effect with monetari polici   the result of your paper  art  suggest to me that we have larg achiev this condit of stabl inflat   or certain we   re a lot closer to it than we were befor   despit all of the measur problem and other problem that have plagu the data we deal with in conduct monetari polici   in other word  i think one can interpret this result as suggest that  on averag  we have stabil inflat more success over the last fifteen year than earlier   and i take some comfort from this  especi now  sinc we are stabil the inflat rate more effect at a veri low rate   by the same token  i   m not surpris that these various macro variabl have help to predict inflat in earlier period when we were conduct monetari polici differ becaus stabil inflat has not alway been a prioriti for the fed   for exampl  low unemploy had prioriti over stabl inflat in the     s  as i think we all know   howev  we deliber and aggress disinfl in the earli     s under chairman volcker   so in period like that  one would expect these other variabl to help in predict inflat go forward  i think  on the board staff   s paper  i have to tell you that your conclus that the role of monetari polici in bring the inflat rate down over the     s amount to onli about    percent was a bit of a blow to me   my reaction was that mayb i ought to spend less  e on the fomc and more  e on itoc   and mayb i   ll see if i can get cathi to let me re up for the fspc
oh  but you wouldn   t do that  would you
i   ll get back to you on that    laughter   serious  while i   m not question the econometr  i just think it would be a mistak to draw the broad conclus from these result that polici play a secondari role in reduc inflat in the     s   i   m not necessarili suggest that you   re say that  but i see that interpret as a danger when one look at those result  i would note in particular that if one look at the detail of this studi  basic the model assum that the inflat target is a move averag of lag actual inflat   in other word  the studi assum that we move our implicit inflat target in line with recent chang in actual  inflat   in still other word   to use some ancient terminolog that don and a few other around here will certain recogn   the studi model monetari polici as implicit inflat target with base drift   the point is that just as the fomc chose  at least implicit  to let our m  money target drift up with actual money growth in the     s   which was a bad choic as it turn out   we chose in the late     s to let our implicit inflat target drift down with actual inflat   and  of cours  this turn out to be a veri good approach  and it produc good result  view from this perspect  i think the fed had much more to do with the     s  disinfl than the    percent econometr result might at first blush seem to suggest   in some sens we had everyth to do with it sinc we chose to pass the downward effect of rise product growth on actual current inflat onto trend inflat   we could have done it differ   we could have follow a more s ul polici  which might have result in less disinfl   so in that sens i believ we had everyth to do with these result   i want to make one final point if i may   while a polici of let our implicit inflat target drift with actual inflat was felicit in the late     s   to the extent that it allow us in fact to achiev price stabil   this opportunist disinfl or whatev we want to call it seem to me clear to have outliv it use   we obvious don   t want the current low  inflat to turn into deflat  and we don   t want it to turn back up into increas inflat   we don   t want it to drift at all   against that background  we now have what strike me as a wonder opportun to fix the target and announc it explicit    laughter   i alway get back to that  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  may i make one clarifi comment just so there isn   t ani confus about what   and   have shown on exhibit     in our model of the economi  inflat is a monetari phenomenon   and you as policymak take all the credit and all the blame for the long run movement of inflat  includ the disinfl of the     s   what that decomposit in the tabl is show is the portion of the unusu behavior of inflat in the second half of the     s attribut to those factor   it   not indic the contribut that monetari polici made to the disinfl that occur becaus ul  that is in the hand of this committe   in tri to explain the unusu develop  that breakdown indic that about    percent of that is explain by the chang in the way you conduct monetari polici
i just want to make sure we get credit not onli for the    but for the    and the       laughter
anoth part of this chart that is not shown is the rise in inflat to    percent in      and the declin to   percent in        that   s all on your plate as well
i think     s record on psycholog and diplomaci has just gone up to match his skill as an economist    laughter
i think most of us agre that  in the long run  money growth determin the price level   i don   t think there   s ani argument about that   but certain money growth is not veri help for predict inflat in the short term period that we work with around this tabl  i think one of the problem here is that  with all the difficulti of the phillip curv  we need a hors to beat a hors   we need someth better but we don   t have a framework that is a whole lot better   and the framework that emphas money growth  although i   m probabl the one who give more weight to it than almost anybodi els around the tabl  just  sn   t do the job that need to be done over the short horizon  we all agre from the debat of the late     s and earli     s that there is no equilibrium relationship between the rate of inflat and the unemploy rate   what we have here is an effort to make the chang in the inflat rate depend on the labor market in some way  let   s say the unemploy gap and some other variabl   now  there is no theoret structur behind that  as is true of adjust mechan in general   for exampl  in the invest world there are some crude regular   adjust cost argument that tri to motiv invest   but there is noth that we would regard  i think  as worthi of be elev to the rank of theori behind ani detail empir model  it is certain true that the equilibrium unemploy rate   call it the natur rate     depend on institut featur of the economi and the labor market   that is part of what is go on here  we   re tri to figur out what some of those featur might be   and that   s perfect consist with what we know or think we   ve known for a long  e   i would view the discuss of the role of product growth in the same way   it make a lot of sens to me that firm would understand the effect of the product chang that are take place a lot more  quick than the employe and  therefor  that we would get a result that would fit this way   we might extract some empir regular  but i certain wouldn   t want to go veri far in reli on it   it might help us understand what has been go on  but i certain wouldn   t want to mortgag my hous on the basi of such a relationship  if i may put it that way  i would offer an observ that the staff endeavor   certain in what we have seen befor us   seem to put a lot of effort on the institut featur in determin the natur rate of unemploy   i would hope that there is at least as much work under this on what i would call employ rate or particip rate issu becaus it seem to me that some of the more strike recent develop relat to the fraction of the work age popul that is  employ   we may have some interest issu ahead of us  with chang in the procliv of peopl over age     a categori for which i am now qualifi  to continu work   so we may find that the unemploy rate itself will not be tell us a lot of the inform that is avail out there  i also think that what we call lack of price power depend critic on the assumpt of entrench low inflat go forward   in my view  inflat expect are a critic part  of this phenomenon  and that  of cours  come back to the way in which monetari polici is conduct   and the way the chang in the conduct of monetari polici show up in this model is  i guess  with a chang in the beta and gamma   i suppos gamma particular would be get a lower weight over  e in the equat in exhibit    one can see the import of expect just by think about what has happen recent in argentina   no one would want to project what   s go to happen on the day the currenc board disappear   one would not want to project inflat on that day on the basi of ani of the variabl   such as the unemploy rate or the recent histori of inflat   in a model like this   there would be a power chang in the outlook as a consequ of someth that had happen  and one could not project inflat in ani reason way base on convent macroeconom variabl of this kind  i make that observ becaus this committe  unfortun  in the space of a relat few year is go to be deal with the transit of the chairmanship   and that is go to set the stage potenti for a signific chang in the outlook for the economi  certain there will be a natur amount of uncertainti   tri to extend the polici we   ve had in  recent year and the expect of that polici to a new chairmanship will be someth critic to the way thing evolv in come year
thank   i   d like to pick up on a point that presid pool made in pass  this whole issu of the so call suppli shock and the benefici natur of it   your point about whi it is that we have benefit from this make a lot of sens   but then anoth point you make is that to some extent the question now is our resolv and how much further we can go  there has been a huge amount of discuss about this so call product surpris   i would  think that at this stage worker are no longer as easili fool about it   also  i believ that some of these chang are structur  particular the internet and perhap develop in help  suppli   one chang you didn   t put in your exhibit is the fact that variabl pay had becom import and may well becom less import   all these develop might leav this committe relat quick   no more than the five year that bill   talk about    in a potenti more difficult situat of higher product growth but still more rapid adjust in wage   i   d like to know if there are ani earli sign that you look at or if you have ani thought about how much  e we have here becaus in some sens we are live on borrow  e
i   d like to make one clarifi point about the product stori that relat both to what presid pool said and what you just said   i don   t think it   s necessari in explain the product stori to believ that worker are fool and that they don   t know for a long  e what aggreg product growth is   i think most peopl don   t know what aggreg product growth is   what they do know is how they feel about their job  and they may have some sens of what other job might be avail if they were to look elsewher  mobil is a characterist of the labor market   when product increas occur  they are concentr in certain firm and certain industri  and over  e those firm rais their demand for labor
so the job opportun aspect are realiz gradual
well  that   s what i meant by the internet and help suppli and all those job market develop that tend to allow that competit pressur to go through more quick into wage   it   s not just that worker are fool   ul  i guess my question is this  given these structur chang  aren   t we like to see a situat sooner rather than later in which this increas in product   in fact play through relat quick to wage   and  therefor  the one  e benefit that we get from a so call suppli shock will elud us
inde  on the product stori per se  we have tri to emphas the uncertainti about the adjust speed   but have said that  we believ we are probabl come to the end of it fair soon  if we have not alreadi   as for the other factor we talk about perhap have more durabl effect on the natur rate  i don   t know      do you have  ani comment on that
we think the product effect inde may be just about play out  but we do believ that the other labor market develop are go to be more durabl   so that portion we expect to continu
may i add one more point to the answer to your question   there   s no sens that there is ani payback from the benefit of product that has to be met at some point  so while we   re say that the product stori has play out  we have reach this lower rate of inflat   in our view  there   s no reason for inflat to have to move up in the futur becaus worker haven   t gotten their full respons to it   so we   ve settl in at a new
but this   get to a point that i think al broaddus was make  which is that the opportunist disinfl that has occur over the last sever year  in part becaus of the product shock  is not someth that we can be complac about   and sinc in some sens i   ve mortgag my hous base on keep inflat low and stabl  i think it   s pretti import that we understand that   this is the onli job i   ve got    laughter
i found the paper veri interest   i think a few of you know that i have been tri to learn more about where the research stand on product and monetari polici  but as someon come from the privat sector there is one comment   an observ   i   d like to make   when i look at exhibit   and the factor you show as have had effect on the natur rate of unemploy  there   s onli one item on the list that to me reflect what busi actual was do in this period  and that   s what i would call help suppli   also  i think there   s an area on which compani have been work in the last decad that we may not be captur here  let me start by prefac my remark with this comment   ceo and cfos think in term of nomin earn growth  not real earn growth   so as inflat start come down in the     s  they were challeng to retain the kind of growth in earn they had been get in order to keep their stock price up   in the     s compani tend to resort   and this is a broad statement   to financi leverag   there were a lot of leverag buyout and a lot of excess that creat problem and led to the recess we had in the earli     s   as a result  busi execut had to go to the next type of leverag that a compani can control to improv profit  and that   s oper leverag   so the decad of the     s becam increas complex as firm realli began to focus on widen oper margin   as the decad move along  compani ran into a bottleneck in their effort to becom more effici   they found that  as unemploy drop  they were hire worker who were further down on the skill ladder   and becaus they were hire peopl who had few skill  make that oper margin wider from the cost side was becom more difficult   so in part i think the increas  invest and greater focus on invest where product result could be achiev   as oppos to firm take a view of let   s just see if this work   has been driven by the scarciti of  labor skill   as we go through a period where labor becom more avail  that scarciti may not be as evid   i would love to see the staff follow up on the suggest of look at the experi of some other countri becaus anecdot we hear report that some of the  countri with shortag of labor have seen spurt of product too   so think about it from the demand for labor side might be anoth area where this cross countri type of research might be help
this follow up a bit on what susan was just say and also on what vice chairman   was talk about   i was veri interest when i read the materi on the relationship between product and price power   it struck me as i was read it  that this is a zero sum game   there are winner and loser   and there   s an extent to which that would tend to encourag invest in new technolog   at a  e when there is not an obvious    killer app    in new technolog  it would seem to me that there would be less tendenc for busi execut to return to a mindset of increas capit invest   wouldn   t there be more caution   would that be one of the reason we   re not see a rebound in capit invest   i say that in a meet where we are celebr uncertainti   or at least acknowledg that there   s a great deal of uncertainti   so though i   m not certain  as i read this materi at the end of last week  it struck me that that could be the case
it certain is a stori for whi invest collaps and whi it might not rebound right away   i think you are right that peopl do seem to be more cautious now
but i hadn   t thought of it from a  e perspect   if inde  e is an issu now that the economi is soft and caution seem to be the watchword  then  e would also be import onc the economi turn around   it would suggest that the particip rate might move a lot fa  on the upsid also   i don   t know  but i think that could be the case
i was go to say someth veri similar to what governor bie talk about   i was surpris that it took as long as it did in this staff paper to get to the role of price power   i think the issu is to some extent a question of what come first   the chicken or  the egg  the low inflat environ or the concern about price power   is there causal  also  there   s the issu of the sever shortag of skill and it impact on product   and in the  context of have to pay for skill  there is the interact between that cost and the veri real feel on the part of busi  which presid   mention  that they don   t have price power   how   all of that interact on the larger stage   i think there are a number of area here that would be fruit for further research   everywher i go  busi peopl  at both big and small compani  alway talk about their lack of price power and the fact that even with the looser labor market they realli need skill peopl that they can   t get   either those worker aren   t avail  or these firm can   t afford them   most the complaint is that they can   t find the skill worker  general they would be will to pay for them becaus they  believ they   re worth it  i don   t know how to frame a research question that would appeal to you research type   laughter   everi  e i mention global and all of that to the peopl who work for me  they tell me that trade good are onli a small part of it  blah  blah  blah    laughter   but i think there   s someth here that would be worthwhil look into   i wish i could put it in a more rigor context for you
presid    one aspect of what we saw in the late     s certain lend some support to that view   one hypothesi  or one of the previous empir styliz fact  was that late in expans we get sag in product as lower skill worker are brought into the labor forc   but what happen in recent year was obvious just the opposit   so it seem at least possibl that some of the product gain were in fact be s ul by firm in essenc tri to work their way around that declin qualiti of the avail labor pool   and i do think it would be a veri interest research project
on the global issu  we obvious observ consider less price power  at least from our data system  for manufactur good or tradabl good general   what is not clear is whether the differ is an issu of product  which is intern  or whether it relat to the competit come from tradabl good   one difficulti is that our price data on so call non intern tradabl good is dubious in too mani respect   if we took the data liter  the argument for global be a critic issu in the loss of price power is put up against the issu that somehow we get better product out of good product than we do out of servic product   i don   t know what econom principl stipul that that has to be the case   i was wonder whether  with all of these uncertainti  we had the abil to infer anyth about the lack of price power by have  say  a hors race between global and product   the product effect appar show up in the manufactur good area and creat that lack of price power   but the latter also happen with regard to tradabl good   and one can argu the revers of that argument   name  that it is a lack of price power that engend the product   do you have the capac to disentangl all of that
our read of the literatur on where product come from and where technolog progress come from is that whether or not greater competit pressur is a factor drive greater product growth seem to be an open question   one shred of evid in that regard come from intern comparison of growth that suggest that more open economi do tend to grow fa  than less open economi   so there   s one shred of evid that actual draw a link from
and i assum we would infer from that that it   s the  product and not the popul growth that is relev in that regard
absolut   i meant product growth   in open economi output per person grow fa
may i offer an observ on price power   if you think about what happen in the medic area in the mid     s  the chang in competit condit push down the rate for hospit or at least control them   but clear price can   t be push down so far that it send compani into bankruptci   what has happen in more recent year is that there has been a lot of consolid among hospit and their rate have gone up substanti  we   ve seen veri big increas   and there  sn   t seem to be ani problem with price power on the health insur premium that most of us are pay for our employe these day  those rate are go up and up  we   ve seen increas of about    percent a year for a coupl of year now   so it has to depend on the competit condit and also on the product that allow compani to stay in busi with price that keep be shade down  if we look at airlin today  we find that some of the major airlin are in veri serious condit  on the brink of bankruptci   i didn   t read this morn   s newspap  so mayb somebodi has alreadi file today   i don   t know   on the other hand  airlin like southwest and jet blue that have a differ product process are do just fine   so it   s got to be a combin of competit condit and product that allow the price declin to still yield profit so that compani stay in busi
you know  it   s not at all clear that medic price are go up   what we do know is that the aggreg dollar amount spent on medic care and insur is go up   but we have no way from the data system that exist to argu against the hypothesi that unit medic price haven   t move at all in recent year
i don   t disagre with that except that there is a signific chang from the trend in the mid     s   for exampl  if medic price today are go down per unit of valu deliv  they   re not go down as fast as they were five year ago   that   s my onli point there
that may well be   in other word  deflat in medic price is assur less than it was five year ago if inde those price are deflat
exact   and anoth exampl would be univers  we   re see a lot of tuition increas now   state univers in particular are put through increas becaus of the pressur on state budget   i don   t know whether there   s a product stori you want to tri to tell there  laughter  but that   s certain a differ
there i will stipul that it   s hard to find
those are real price increas
to be sure   presid
this is just a further elabor on the point roger   was make earlier that the product effect will fade but may persist a while longer   and  of cours  your point that the product acceler repres    percent of the differ between the two simul make it extrem import   i was wonder if you   ve look at this trend in compens and product in relationship to labor   s share of the total incom pie   i rememb these data veri well   as we all know  labor   s share came down from      to      and then start to go up in      and is now near it histor high   the reason i rememb these data so well is that in       at the request of our bank   s chairman  who at the  e was the head of the chicago afl cio  we gave a present to our board of director on compens trend   he saw the nonlabor share go up and  of cours  got veri concern  after he left our board  that share start to come down    laughter   i   ve alway been mean to bring him up to date on these data   so  i was just wonder if you   ve thought about that in the context of the analys that you   ve done in this paper
well  one answer is that the model we   re use to provid these quantit es  make use of the labor share as one of the explanatori variabl that enter into the dynam of inflat   price inflat and wage inflat   but the view of this model is that the labor share goe up and down over a period of  e but it   s ul  go to equilibr at some constant   view over the broad span of the last thirti or forti year  the labor share tend not to have a trend in it   i guess our view would be that  measur relat to trend product  the labor share is pretti close to it histor averag at the moment   when product took off  the labor share was depress for a while  but it has been rebound as compens has caught up     that answer your question
it   s help   i guess i had thought that the labor share was near it histor high now  not the averag   am i wrong on that
the labor share has come back up to near it averag
to it averag
yes   and in our view  that is indic of the product stori have play itself out   we would expect  as the product stori is play out  that the labor share would tend to come back to it histor averag
so  under your statement that the growth in product may  persist awhil longer is a view that it is get less and less like
the key is that we   re anticip some acceler in product again as capit accumul pick up   so we expect to get an addit benefit for a while
but it probabl will be small relat to what we   ve seen in the past sever year
so our job get more difficult go forward
two remark  mr  chairman   as my earlier comment indic  i think the staff may be confus cyclic and secular trend   that is  i believ the pickup in particip of labor is a result of the recess and veri like will not continu   on the intern comparison of product  we   ve been spend a fair amount of  e in new york look at a question that i believ is a matter of consider concern in mani way  and that is  whi has product in the unit state sinc the mid     s been so much better than that experienc by our friend in the european communiti   there are no high qualiti studi on the whole european communiti  but there are some veri good studi on the big four   germani  itali  franc  and holland  which though much smaller than the first three is actual quit a lot larger than the other small countri   and if one look at the area in which tradabl good are involv   in the pure tech sector   the product improv in the european four in that sector is just about the same as it is in the unit state   and in the rest of manufactur it   s quit similar  the remark area where the unit state is huge ahead of the european four is in the servic sector   when one tri to look for an explan  first i would note that in the servic sector in europ there is not as much intern competit   also  i think the strength of their view on the role of the state   in term of the state be respons for the individu   and the strength of the trade union movement play through in veri  veri littl product improv in the servic area  wherea in the unit state  it is in some of the servic area where the use of inform technolog has been most help in veri substanti improv product   i found it veri interest that it was product in the servic sector that account for virtual the entir explan of the differenti in our favor
arthur  do you want to have the close word   sinc you termin your present there have been a lot of implicit attack on your paper
yes  there is one comment i   d like to make   a number of peopl have made the point that robert luca made a number of year ago  which is that in an environ with high and variabl inflat we   re go to see this correl between unemploy and inflat   and inde  unemploy then help us predict inflat   but when we stabil inflat and move to a stabl environ  as we   ve done  that relationship disappear   i think we all believ we   re in such an environ   so go forward  assum we   re go to maintain that environ  the question is this   are we still go to reli on a phillip curv to help us predict unemploy  or are we go to acknowledg that there is anoth model and that it is a simpl nave model   at the minimum i would argu that we should be put less weight on the phillip curv   s abil to tell us anyth about the futur cours of inflat   it shouldn   t have the weight that it has had in the past   i   m not argu against structur model  i   m not argu that there is noth we can learn by tri to understand under behavior in this economi   but it is import to notic  and i think mani of you did  that the relationship between unemploy and inflat is depend on polici   we are now in a veri stabl inflat environ  so we should be put less weight on that relationship   thank you  mr  chairman
shall we take a break   it has been an excel convers and i compliment all of the particip   it was veri use   coffe break
we   ll now go to the chart show  which will be present sequenti by        olin  and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   we   re go to be refer to the packag of materi entitl    staff present on the econom outlook     your first chart present a broad overview of the staff forecast   the upper left panel provid an updat of our  book project of real gdp growth by includ data that we receiv late last week on foreign trade and defens spend   taken togeth  those data point to an upward revis of about   percentag point to the growth of real gdp in both the first and second quarter   a revis that return us close to our may forecast   the basic contour of our longer run project also remain larg unchang from may   s ul monetari and fiscal polici  among other thing  are expect to encourag a gradual re acceler of final sale   the red line in the panel to the right   growth of real gdp   the black line    show an even sharper improv than final sale  as an end to inventori liquid and then some restock add impetus to product   in the near term  the linger soft in labor market is expect to result in a further rise in the unemploy rate   the middl left panel   which we project will reach a peak of about   percent this summer   meanwhil  pce price inflat   the black line in the panel to the right   rebound from level that were depress last year by sharpli    materi use by mr     mr  olin  and ms   son are append to this transcript  appendix     fall energi price   core inflat   the red line   is expect to move sideway  the lower left panel compar our current project with the one that we present in the januari  book   as you know  we have strengthen consider the project growth of real gdp in both      and        this fa  growth of real output has led us to revis down our es  of the unemploy rate a bit this year  and next   dare i say it   less slack in labor and product market  laughter  and a  sharper turnaround in non oil import price than we had project in januari more than offset some favor suppli side revis to our forecast  and we expect pce price inflat to run a bit higher than in our earlier forecast   as shown in the panel to the right  the   percentag point upward revis to project growth of real gdp this year is compos of almost equal size posit contribut from household spend and busi fix invest  with smaller and rough offset chang elsewher   turn to your next chart  the most recent near term indic have been  broad consist with our view that econom activ is continu to expand but at a consider more subdu pace than earlier in the year   manufactur ip  shown in the upper left panel  has been increas steadili sinc the turn of the year  and we expect that the gradual recoveri under way in this sector will continu   one reason is that inventori have move into more comfort align with sale   day    suppli of manufactur good   the right panel   has about return to it low point in earli        in addit  the order pictur has shown improv in recent month   the ism index of new order   the middl left panel   has been fluctuat around a reason robust level in recent month  lend support to the view that the recent pickup in factori output has some stay power   more broad  the labor market seem to have turn up in recent month   as shown to the right  there have been small increas in privat payrol employ in the past two month  after more than a year of near steadi declin   spend also appear to be increas this quarter  though at a much slower pace than in the first quarter   in particular  the increas in consum outlay over the past few month  shown in the lower left panel  have been much smaller than earlier in the year   even though hous start    plot to the right   jump in may  they return to a level about match that of the first quarter  impli that residenti invest will make onli a small contribut to the growth of real gdp in the current quarter  after be a signific plus in the first quarter   tomorrow morn we will receiv data on order and shipment of capit good in may  an import piec of the busi spend pictur   chart   highlight the polici environ that shape our forecast   the upper left panel display our model base es  of the equilibrium real fund rate   with the real fund rate hover close to zero  we believ that monetari polici is set to fo  a return to abov trend growth later this year and into        in recent month  there has been a consider converg of the staff   s polici assumpt and market expect   as shown in the right panel  the staff assumpt   the solid black line   incorpor a bit less tighten than is anticip by the market   the solid red line   but those differ are now veri small in comparison with the wide gap in expect that exist in januari   shown by the two dash line   the stock market   the middl left panel   is project to be about flat through year end befor trend up in        the loss of household net worth over the past coupl of year is expect to be an ongo drag on domest demand dure the project period  howev  the anticip gradual declin in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   the middl right panel   should help to fill that shortfal by boost export and restrain import   fiscal polici also is expect to provid a substanti boost to aggreg demand this year and next   fiscal impetus  plot in the lower left panel  exceed   percent of gdp this year and remain abov    percent of gdp in        polici action  the cyclic weak of the economi  and the substanti shortfal in tax receipt this year have led to a signific deterior in the feder fiscal posit   as shown to the right  we are now project unifi deficit of      billion and      billion in fiscal year      and       respect     olin will now continu our present
your next two exhibit survey the financi backdrop for our forecast  start with the corpor sector   on the whole  we think this sector is in reason good financi shape  though there are clear pocket of stress   one indic of this stress  shown in the upper left panel  is the elev default rate on corpor bond   the rise in default has it root in the buildup of corpor debt in the late     s   as can be seen to the right  such debt expand in real term at rough a    percent annual rate dure      and        although the rapid debt growth has creat difficulti for some firm  we do not anticip that a debt  overhang will be a major constraint on busi spend   even among lower rate firm  debt problem are the except rather than the norm  as indic by the middl left panel  which plot interest expens as a share of cash flow for specul grade firm   as you can see from the red line  this measur of interest burden has risen sharpli for the firm at the   th percentil of the distribut   but for the median firm   the black line   the interest burden remain well below it peak a decad ago  in addit  as shown to the right  nonfinanci corpor have a lot of cash to servic their oblig   the ratio of liquid asset to short term liabil rose sharpli last year as firm use the proceed from heavi bond issuanc to bol  their balanc sheet   ul   the financi health of the corpor sector depend on it abil to generat profit   the lower left panel plot the annual relationship between the growth in econom profit  the vertic axi  and the growth in nonfarm busi gdp  the horizont axi   with each dot repres a singl year   as shown by the red dot for       the staff   s outlook for profit growth this year is stronger than the histor relat would suggest  while the forecast for      is a littl below the regress line   averag across the two year  we   re expect a fair normal pickup in profit condit on the pace of output gain   we worri  though  that the profit growth in our forecast will fall short of market expect   as shown to the right  secur analyst forecast that earn per share for s p     firm will increas more than    percent in      and will post long term gain of      percent at an annual rate   analyst tend to be a bullish lot  so in the second column we have restat these forecast on a bias adjust basi   we have written down rang rather than point es  becaus the es  bias depend on the  e period over which it is measur   even the bottom end figur appear over op ist given our view that trend growth of the economi  in current dollar term  probabl is in the neighborhood of   percent annual   henc  the bias adjust rang impli a larg and persist rise in the profit share of gnp  which seem unlik   it is this concern about market expect that led us to write down the rather anem baselin path for stock price that dave note earlier and to includ the  book simul of a signific declin in the stock market    your next exhibit turn to financi condit in the household sector  household have taken on a lot of debt in recent year  which   as shown in the top left panel   has lift the aggreg debt servic burden near back to the peak reach in the     s   the high level of debt has creat problem for some  household   for exampl  delinqu on auto loan to nonprim borrow   the blue line in the panel to the right   have jump over the past year   howev  broader measur of household loan perform look much less worrisom   auto loan extend by the financ arm of the big three carmak   the red line   have continu to perform well   and the aggreg delinqu rate on all consum and  home mortgag loan at commerci bank   the black line   remain well below the level seen at the end of the         recess   although the financi press has often highlight household debt burden  we think the real stori is on the asset side of the household balanc sheet   the middl left panel display total household asset and liabil  both scale by dispos incom   as shown  household asset are current about six  e the valu of liabil  and movement on the asset side account for almost all the variat in net worth  the differ between the two seri   thus  in assess the influenc of household balanc sheet on spend  our focus is on the key driver of asset valu   name  equiti price and hous price   dave has alreadi discuss our outlook for equiti price   the panel to the right plot chang in real hous price over the past twenti five year   as measur by the repeat sale index for exist home   along with our forecast   as you can see  these price have move up sharpli over the past coupl of year  inde  the    percent rise from mid      to mid      is the fastest four quarter chang shown in the chart   the rate of price appreci has come down somewhat of late and  for the forecast  we assum that hous price gain will moder further   the rapid appreci in recent year has prompt talk of an emerg hous price bubbl  similar to the boom bust cycl of the late     s and earli     s   while we would not entir dismiss these concern  we believ they are overblown   the lower left panel present a key piec of evid in this regard   here we have plot real hous price  in red  against real per capita incom  in black  for a set of major  citi on the east and west coast   we focus on these coastal citi becaus this is where hous price were subject to the widest swing in the last cycl   as shown  hous price in these citi zoom relat to per capita incom in the late      s and then correct back down to the incom path over the next sever year   more recent  hous price have again risen relat to incom  but the gap between the two is consider smaller than in the prior cycl   given the slow in hous price inflat alreadi under way  we do not expect price to diverg from incom to the extent observ in the late      s   befor conclud this tour of financi condit  the lower right panel make a veri brief stop at the bank sector   quit unlik the situat a decad ago  bank are in good shape overal   the aggreg return on asset    the black line   has remain high  and the share of asset at well capit bank   the red line    continu to hover close to     percent   accord  we anticip that the bank sector will not imped the recoveri  in contrast to the headwind that came from this sector in the prior cycl    a key issu in the staff project is the outlook for busi invest  the topic of your next exhibit   as shown in the top left panel  we es  that real busi fix invest  line    edg up in the current quarter  which would be the first increas in more than a year   we look for moder gain in spend over the second half of this year  follow by more robust growth in        the initi impetus for this pickup come from stronger outlay for equip and softwar  line     as construct spend  line    is expect to declin further in come quarter and then to stage onli a tepid recoveri next year   the current pictur for high tech equip   an import driver of total e s outlay   is decid mix   the good news is that real outlay for comput equip turn up late last year and appear to be on a solid  if unspectacular  growth path   the panel to the right plot real comput shipment  in red  along with domest product of semiconductor  in black   which we have found to have some lead inform for these shipment   as you can see  semiconductor output continu to rise through may  which bode well for further growth in comput outlay   we expect the spend gain in the second half to remain close to those record of late  consist with anecdot report that see no breakout   on the upsid or downsid   from recent trend   in contrast  the news from the telecom  sector remain downright abysm   the industri still has too much capac  and as shown by the red line in the middl left panel  analyst are continu to mark down their es  of year ahead earn growth for telecom servic provid   in this environ  we expect no upturn in spend on telecom equip befor next year   that said  telecom equip is onli a small part of total e s spend  and we think the outlook for aggreg outlay is consider brighter   the panel to the right show the histor relationship between the growth in real e s spend   on the vertic axi   and the acceler in busi output   on the horizont axi   as you can see  our forecast for      is veri close to that impli by a standard acceler  while the project for next year is somewhat abov the regress line  in part becaus we expect spend to get a notic boost from the partial expens allow that expir in        the near term outlook for nonresidenti construct activ  shown in the lower left panel  is rather bleak  reflect the widespread overhang of avail space   as you can see from the red line  contract for nonresidenti project   which tend to lead actual construct    have continu to trend down  suggest that the declin in activ has not yet run it cours   howev  we believ that the ongo suppli adjust is sow the seed for a recoveri  albeit a mild one  next year   the panel to the right illustr this point for the offic sector   as shown by the black line  real offic construct peak in late      and has sinc fallen by about one third  which contrast with the much slower adjust in the late     s   the wide shade area show that it took five year  from      to       for construct spend to drop as much  in percentag term  as dure the latest five quarter  even though the high vacanc rate at that  e clear signal an excess suppli of space   the fa  contract today like reflect the greater disciplin now be exert by lender and the financi market   as a result  we do not expect anyth like a repeat of the prolong disloc in the earlier period   your next exhibit present the outlook for household spend   the top panel document the unusu behavior of these outlay dure the recent recess   as shown on line    pce and residenti invest spend typic increas slowli lead up to the cyclic peak  edg down dure the recess  and then rebound sharpli dure the first year of the recoveri   in contrast  dure the current episod  real outlay remain on a solid uptrend through the recess   given that there has been no spend declin to recov from  and with negat wealth effect still at work  we anticip that the gain over the forecast period will be well below the cyclic norm   the unusu natur of the current cycl is also evid from the behavior of stock of consum durabl good and hous  shown in the middl panel   the growth of the durabl stock   the black line   normal slow sharpli dure recess and then rebound dure the first coupl year of recoveri   this  e around  the stock of durabl continu to expand rapid through the recess  the high current level of outlay on durabl  combin with our forecast of a moder further rise  keep the stock grow at a histor fast pace   the stori for the hous stock   the red line   is rough the same  it growth was well maintain dure the recess  and our outlook for residenti invest spend impli no slowdown through        obvious  we do not agre with those who say that household spend has    hit the wall    after sever year of rapid growth   our outlook is more favor becaus we expect product to remain on a strong uptrend  which will generat sizabl gain in real incom   the longer term relationship between product and incom  growth is shown in the lower panel  where we have plot percent chang from five year earlier for both seri in order to smooth through some of the cyclic effect  as you can see  these smooth seri are high correl  and with product gain expect to remain hefti  we anticip that household will have the wherewith to keep spend on an upward track   dave will now discuss our outlook for product in more detail
your next exhibit present our current take on the strong perform of product growth in recent quarter   the upper left panel address the simpl question     did it realli happen      in this panel  i use two independ measur of output   one measur on the product side and the other measur from  the incom side   i also use two independ measur of hour work   one from  the establish survey and one from the household survey   the remark find is that it  sn   t matter how you combin these measur  the growth of product appear to have increas over the past year   a period of notic weak in the economi   one explan for the unexpect strength is that under product growth has been fa  than we had earlier es    inde  in previous forecast round  we respond to these develop  in part  by revis up our es  of the growth in structur product   as shown to the right  we now es  that structur product will rise   percent this year and     percent in       these figur are about   percentag point fa  than our es  at the begin of the year   structur product growth in      is expect to near match it perform in the second half of the     s   howev  the composit of those gain is expect to be differ   we are expect less of a contribut from capit deepen   the middl left panel   owe to the modest rebound we are expect in capit spend   and we are expect more of a contribut from multifactor product   the middl right panel   reflect it recent strength   anoth explan for the buoyanc of product over the past year or so is the influenc of adjust cost   an issu you may recal that was explor by our colleagu    fernald  at the chicago fed in a paper circul to the committe last year   in brief  the idea is that firm incur cost  such as down  and train  when they instal new equip  whether it be a comput system for offic worker  or machin tool on the shop floor   this repres  e and effort that would otherwis have been devot to produc final output   in a period of rapid increas in the capit stock  these adjust cost could be sizabl and might distort the assess of under product growth   likewis  a sudden declin in invest  such as has occur over the past year and a half  might result in a sharp drop in these adjust cost  lead measur product growth to overst the advanc in under product   line   in the lower panel report the standard measur of labor product in the nonfarm busi sector   line  a and  b present figur for product growth that net out the effect of high and low es  of these adjust cost   firm level data suggest that these adjust cost are relat small  consist with the es  on line  a   macro base es   such as those develop by   fernald  tend to be larger  similar to those on line  b   between      and       when invest was boom  growth of labor product net of adjust cost exceed measur product growth   howev  in       in the wake of the invest collaps  product net of adjust cost slow more sharpli than measur product growth   in effect  some of the appar favor perform of product over the past year may reflect the fact that firm incur fewer adjust cost as invest declin   still  these calcul suggest that this has not been a larg part of the stori  and empir  our es  of structur product is not much affect by these consider   the upper left panel of chart   display a third element in our interpret of recent product develop   we continu to believ that firm have remain uncertain about the strength of the recoveri and have been squeez more out of their exist workforc   this has been reflect in a movement of actual product abov our es  structur trend   our baselin forecast incorpor growth in labor product of about   percent at an annual rate in the second half  the employ implic of the baselin project are shown to the right   after a project gain in privat payrol of        in june  we forecast a gradual acceler to averag month gain of         in the third quarter and         in the fourth quarter   recogn that consider uncertainti surround this aspect of our project  i also show the employ consequ of slower and fa  product growth  in the slower product scenario  i assum no growth in labor product in the second half   an outcom close to that project by our model   hold our output forecast constant  such an outcom would be accompani by veri rapid employ gain and a fall in the unemploy rate to about     percent by year end   the fa  product growth scenario assum growth in product of about     percent through the end of the year  similar to the pace we think has occur in the current quarter   such an outcom would produc  in essenc  a    jobless    recoveri  with littl net chang in payrol employ and with the unemploy rate rise abov     percent in the fourth quarter   this is  of cours  a veri partial equilibrium analysi  but it   give a rough sens of how altern product outcom could shape near term labor market develop   in that regard  initi claim for unemploy insur   the middl left panel   have fallen to a level consist with our project june employ gain of          but some further declin will be necessari over the next month or so if we are to reach our project averag increas in the third quarter of           household impress of labor market condit   shown to the right   also have remain relat lacklust to date   overal  we are expect soft labor market condit to hold the growth of hour labor compens over the next year and a half below the rate of increas post in        measur by either the employ cost index   the red line in the lower panel   or by nonfarm busi compens   the black line   as can be seen in the upper left panel of chart     the subdu growth in hour labor compens and the relat strong gain in structur labor product togeth suggest that structur unit labor cost   the black line   will not be exert much pressur on price over the forecast period   the project depreci of the dollar is expect to result in a modest acceler in non oil import price   the upper right panel   moreov  energi price   the blue

the final chart present your forecast for      and        as seen in the upper panel  you have revis up your project for the growth of real gdp in      and lower your forecast of the unemploy rate   your project for pce price this year has been rais a touch   your project for next year are display in the lower panel   the central tendenc of those project show growth of real gdp between     and   percent   this is accompani by an anticip reduct in the unemploy rate and stabil in the rate of pce price inflat  mr  chairman  that complet our present
thank you veri much   i ought to comment that ani revis in these forecast that you may wish to make should be submit to   befor close  of busi on juli     question for our colleagu   presid hoenig
i have a question on the dollar and capit flow   you broke out the reduct in capit flow between equiti and other u s  secur   is there ani insight that  you can share with us on that   whi the larger drop off in bond  other than perhap inflat  fear   whi  with a declin dollar  do we see capit flow slow and bond issuanc fall
at this point  these data are suffici new to us   and the revis actual caught member of my staff by surpris   that i don   t have ani further explan  sinc bond issuanc has been fair strong  there is no obvious explan as to whi it should go down   i think the answer is that i don   t realli have a good answer
ani other question for our colleagu   presid
my question is on the altern simul with the weaker dollar   i  understand that you had a    percent reduct in the dollar  but was it spread out over a year
yes  four quarter
four quarter   i was just wonder if you had ani thought on what would happen if that weak occur sooner   say  in the next sever month   in term of the impact on output  employ  and also our polici respons
well  to be honest  i don   t think my model would tell us anyth veri interest about the differ in those two altern becaus the model is quit linear  there would be some littl differ here and there   the monetari polici reaction function would behav differ  which would have some effect   but certain the current tone of the  financi press on the subject and the comment that are be made public distinguish huge between a gradual and order depreci of the dollar   one similar perhap to the         experi   and someth that would be describ as abrupt   the latter would be disrupt of market psycholog and disrupt in term of risk avers behavior   peopl are concern that   if the dollar were to fall rapid  it would trigger reaction and expect that would becom almost self fulfil  the biggest issu is obvious the u s  stock market   we on the staff struggl a great deal as we tri to think about how to express this outlook   not want to put down languag  that suggest the dollar is fall becaus u s  stock price are fall or even vice versa becaus foreign stock price are fall too   inde  foreign stock price in some respect have declin more than u s  stock price   so there is no relat differ that we can point to there   but we interpret the declin in stock price as indic a degre of risk avers in the behavior of some investor   they are move toward invest that they perceiv to be safer  foreign investor  if they see the dollar fall rapid  will recogn that the valu of ani dollar invest they might hold will reflect not onli whatev capit gain or loss it might experi but will suffer from ani depreci of the dollar that might be forthcom too   so one could imagin the chang in market psycholog if expect about the pace at which the dollar will adjust were to be revis   if the dollar   s depreci were expect to be even more rapid  that would enter into some peopl   s calcul about ani dollar asset to buy and would probabl be reflect in our bond price and our equiti price  so there is a psycholog element involv that is difficult for us to pin down   the model do not captur it   but i think it would show through under those circumst  and odd  develop in brazil   or  say  mexico  which is thought to be veri depend on the unit state   could begin to produc market effect here  and we could get feedback loop on risk avers in other way   it could becom a more general problem

thank you      the commentari in the  book seem to suggest that foreign economi in general are expect to do a bit better go forward than we had earlier anticip   my question is    that reflect someth fundament go on abroad  or is it primarili just an extrapol of the most recent inform  which look a littl better than at least i would have expect
more the latter than the former in that we had some posit surpris  emerg asia was even a littl stronger than we expect   and not onli in the high tech countri   thailand  for exampl  which we don   t ordinarili put in that categori  had a veri strong first quarter   canada surpris us a bit on the upsid   i   m a littl fear   in this countri the first quarter look good  too   that april and may will be disappoint abroad  but we don   t know about the perform of their economi quit as fast as we know about the u s  economi   we haven   t correct for that   but on the whole  we   ve had more posit surpris than negat surpris  so on the margin we adjust our outlook
look at chart   on financi condit and the health of the bank sector and recogn that at  e bank perform variabl lag the rest of the economi  i   m wonder how confid you are about the rather op ist perspect there  we   re start to see more camel downgrad than upgrad   and that predict system  the seer or whatev it   s call  is start to suggest that there might be more of that in the wing   obvious we could see rate deterior at larg bank and even at midsiz bank   i just wonder about the level of op  you   ve communic
i   m not realli tri to say that i think all these ratio will look as good one or two or three quarter down the road as they do now   i   m just say that the start point right now is veri differ from what we experienc ten or fifteen year ago
further question   if not  let me just remind you that we   re due at the british embassi at      p m  and that van will pick up the presid at the  waterg at about      this even   we will resum tomorrow at      a m   meet recess  june               of     morn session   morn session   june

demand      obvious  this bode well for profit margin  banker in mani area reflect the same op   as did their small to medium size custom   for some  this has not yet been a recess   but banker in other area  most notabl suburban boston  were much gloomier   talk about gloomi   the invest profession i met with could see almost noth good about equiti market and veri littl if ani light at the end of the tunnel   they believ that market sen ent is be driven by fear of event risk    geopolit event as well as the possibl of anoth enron  tyco  imclon  or now worldcom  they see consider potenti for both a fall stock market and a declin dollar  in sum  the data we have on the region as well as the anecdot from all of our contact suggest an uncertain pictur   there is some strength in demand   one can see it in the region   s hous market  in rise consum and busi confid  and in sale in some industri  moreov  employ in labor market is gradual flatten out and perhap begin to firm   busi are wari about cost  but where it seem possibl  they are invest to improv product   but the hangov from the parti of the     s continu to affect those that seem to be have the best  e   full recoveri  it seem  is go to take a littl longer  on the nation scene  the  book forecast  sn   t differ much from our own  actual  if that forecast turn out to be accur  i think we will have gotten through this period with about as good an outcom as possibl   but as we discuss ye day  forecast veri rare do unfold as predict  and i must say i have some worri about this one   we  like the  book staff and almost everi other forecast  see a second half that is a good deal stronger than the second quarter   i would  howev  like to see more of that growth start to happen   and mayb this upturn in order is just what the doctor order  certain  the sever negat trend in term of job loss and the declin in busi invest in comput and softwar have moder   industri product is rise steadili  we   ve had some good news on order  and auto and hous sale retain some strength   but the overal tone of the current financi climat  sn   t inspir confid   equiti market are a clear sourc of uncertainti   some stock are not do bad  but other have been hit veri hard by investor risk avers   credit market have been buoy by a healthi bank sector and a vibrant bond market  but risk spread have widen   and bank perform variabl  which tend to be lag indic  show some sign of stress   the increas we   re see in camel downgrad and in predict downgrad  sn   t bode well if the economi   not recov as quick as in the forecast  it is true that monetari polici is accommod  and i agre with presid   that we do have to think about when we are go to get back to a neutral polici stanc   fiscal polici is s ul as well   but if i were go to take except to ani aspect of the  book forecast  it would be in the area of state and local spend in        perhap not all state face  the same difficulti as massachusett and some of the we n state that bob parri mention  but i know some are close  the declin in the valu of the dollar may buoy u s  manufactur   it also bring with it  the specter of price pressur   but for the present anyway i   m inclin to discount that on the assumpt that strong global competit will keep import price down and curb u s  domest price as well   the rest of the world may be improv   at least that seem to be the case for the asian tiger  canada  the unit kingdom  and mayb even japan and europ   but not realli by enough to drive strong extern demand   with the futur murki  despit what seem to me to be a fair posit forecast  steadi as she goe may be the best we can do right now
thank you  mr  chairman   data receiv sinc our last meet suggest that the recoveri is proceed at a moder pace in the third district  which is consist with our forecast   the manufactur sector continu to improv   in june our busi outlook survey index of general activ post it sixth posit read in a row  new order and shipment have been expand  and the index are at healthi level  respons to this month   s special survey question suggest that technolog spend in the district should increas at least modest this year   while a major of the firm plan to keep technolog spend at current level    percent more firm plan to increas such spend than to decreas it for the remaind of the year   those increas should occur relat soon  with half of the plan increas come in the third quarter  we expect retail sale to come in weaker in the second quarter than in the first  and the data have been consist with that expect   accord to our contact in the region  retail sale of general merchandis rose slight in may  and auto sale were steadi   this is a bit stronger than we saw for the nation as a whole   pennsylvania sale and use tax collect rose slight in april and may  reflect an increas in non motor vehicl sale  region real estat market are consist with what we see nation   hous sale and residenti construct continu to expand  and hous price have risen on strong demand  in contrast  commerci real estat market in the region have eas sinc the winter   larg amount of subleas space have becom avail  depress rent and boost vacanc rate  the suburban vacanc rate rose abov that of center citi philadelphia earlier this year   this reflect two factor   first  the pattern of the job loss in both the citi and suburb were compar  and second  there   s been veri littl new commerci build and no specul build in the citi over recent year   most recent  the valu of nonresidenti construct contract award in the region has increas slight becaus of casino expans in atlant citi  warehous construct in sever part of the district  and educ and other institut build in the region   it   s too earli to know whether this is the begin of a turnaround in nonresidenti construct  labor market in the district remain stabl  with littl sign of improv or deterior   the unemploy rate in delawar  new jersey  and pennsylvania remain below the nation rate   one of our director run a temporari help firm and she report that demand for worker has been strong  especi in manufactur   on the other hand  mani colleg graduat  unabl to find perman posit  are place applic with the firm  our bos employ index went slight negat in june  indic littl chang in manufactur employ in the region this month   the futur index suggest that manufactur plan to add to their payrol over the next six month  although inflat remain modest in the region  temper by product gain and weak in demand  we   re begin to see some sign of price increas in a few sector of our region   for exampl  our bos index on price paid and price receiv have been posit  sinc march  my view on the nation economi is consist with what we are see in the district  the data appear consist with a recoveri that is proceed at a moder pace   and a moder recoveri was what we expect in part becaus the recess was a mild one  manufactur is recov  consum spend is show moder growth  and there are sign from the order and shipment data that busi fix invest spend has stabil and that equip spend is begin to move back up   these data are consist with our  forecast in which we show real gdp growth slow in the current quarter  follow by a pickup to about potenti in the second half of the year   the pickup is driven by a resumpt of moder expans in consum spend  a return to moder posit inventori invest  and some pickup in equip invest   we have not yet seen much of a declin in the unemploy rate  and we do not expect to see much this year sinc expans in output is expect to be onli around the rate of potenti dure the second half   with strong product growth and continu slack in the economi  inflat ought to remain subdu   next year as the recoveri progress  we expect gdp growth to acceler to somewhat higher than potenti  caus the unemploy rate to come down a bit more rapid and inflat to rise a bit  obvious  there are uncertainti and risk in this forecast   but in my view these risk are balanc  with risk on the upsid as well as the downsid i should note that our forecast is similar to the  book   s with a few except   for exampl  while the  book see inflat on a downward path over the forecast period  in our forecast period it has an upward tilt   given the error band around these forecast  one would be hard press to say there is much differ between them   what we can say is that both envis a modest recoveri and one that will requir monetari polici to move at some point in the not too distant futur   but i   m becom a bit nervous that the market are not go to be prepar for such a move when it come  histori tell us that turn point are hard to gaug and that we will veri like receiv mix data into the recoveri   we have now had veri low interest rate   at recess level   for probabl six month into the recoveri   histori tell us that forecast consist underpredict the strength of the economi at the begin of recoveri and underes  the effect of monetari polici on econom activ   all of this suggest that when we start see better employ data and the financi market have reach a trade rang  we will have to make a polici move   i think it   s import that we start prepar the market for this outcom   we need to let market particip know that we believ the recoveri to be on track  we expect it to be a moder one  the data are come in consist with that forecast  and it is not prudent to maintain a veri accommod monetari polici stanc for too long   if we prepar the market  the first move will be less disrupt   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district   s economi has continu to show sign of improv over the past sever week sinc our last meet  although some  sector obvious remain weak and busi are still act in a cautious manner   prospect for district manufactur actual have improv further though  with new order rise abov year ago level for the first  e sinc the end of        retail sale exclud auto remain solid  with strong sale at both high end store and larg discount make up for somewhat slow sale in other store   home sale have continu strong in most of the district  and energi activ has pick up rather notic in our region late  of cours  not all sign are posit   layoff announc were up in may and appear to be up in june   auto sale weaken somewhat  and commerci real estat remain in a slump in our area   also  while op ist about futur sale  district manufactur appear reluct to hire enough new worker to meet the anticip increas in demand   they are reli extens on temporari help  prefer to wait for further evid of recoveri befor they  engag in signific workforc expans   final  sever larg district firm in the telecom  agricultur  and energi trade busi have experienc further deterior in their financi condit and credit rate sinc our last meet  on the inflat front  wage and price pressur remain most subdu  although obvious we have seen higher steel price and that has had some effect on a number of our metal manufactur compani  turn to the nation outlook  obvious recent econom releas have been mix  nevertheless  i do expect growth to be about     percent this year and to rise to someth over   percent next year   the board staff   s outlook is similar to my own  second quarter growth at about   percent and second half growth at about     percent   i think the forc behind the recoveri are clear and have not chang all that much sinc our last meet   that is  product appear to remain basic sound  monetari polici   with the real fed fund rate near zero   is s ul  fiscal polici is s ul  and the inventori adjust is continu  these factor are work to strengthen the economi and offset the downsid risk to the economi   still  the downsid risk are signific  and i acknowledg them   one is the account scandal  which monetari polici realli can   t do much about  anoth is the geopolit risk  which again we can   t do a lot about   but those risk are real  and they are affect psycholog   there is also a downsid risk in capit spend  which has not pick up as much as we perhap would like to see   and that is still a risk in the futur  let me just say in acknowledg these risk that i still feel that polici remain extrem accommod   and i think we need to take a longer term view of this   everi measur that the staff has present   everi measur we have   suggest that the real feder fund rate is below the natur rate by a signific margin   let me clarifi my polici posit   i have not in the past and i am not suggest now that polici should be tight in ani sens   the condit aren   t at all right for that   i am suggest onli  and i think import  that we prepar to move to a less accommod posit   i would say that for purpos of long run price stabil we are over accommod  and we should begin to consid a longer term strategi to move ourselv toward   not to  but toward   a more neutral posit   and as other have indic  we have an opportun after this meet through your upcom congression tes oni  mr  chairman  to begin to inform the market of this need and to develop a strategi so that we don   t catch them off guard as we necessarili move toward a more neutral polici
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i want to make a comment about state and local financ  an issu that sever peopl have mention   i think that is go to be a concern for some  e   the census number for the state of ohio indic that dure the decad of the     s   between the      census and the      census   there was a    percent absolut declin in the    to    age group  which  sn   t seem to bode well for the futur   and the project for the next decad are that we will have the second lowest popul growth and employ growth on record  which mean that the tax base is erod   a clear implic for the governor  the legislatur  and mani journalist is that ohio need to rais tax signific in order to address it problem   so i hope everybodi els also will rais tax becaus this strategi is not go to work too well otherwis  within the region  econom activ is general character as slowli improv  while the level of sale and product are up from their recent low  the pace of increas is certain slow   the recoveri in truck and ship has been earlier and stronger than was expect at the begin of this year  but employ  especi at the part supplier  has not yet start to rise   sever of the manufactur in the region believ that they will be abl to exceed prior peak level of product with signific fewer worker   i   m go to come back to that point in just a minut   in the automot sector  the combin of continu strong sale and op  express by senior manag is not translat into either capit spend or employ increas so far   instead  both part and assembl plant are report that consider over  is be paid   report from two specif compani are worth mention becaus they offer a hope indic of what would be nice to start hear from other    kin report that it effort over the last coupl of year   the compani has gotten rid of some plant  downsiz  shrunk it labor forc  and so on   will be reflect in much better earn this year   the firm  also say that both it domest and it intern busi have been improv recent  pittsburgh plate and glass note that demand from both the residenti construct and the automot sector remain strong and now it chemic busi is recov after a two year slump   moreov  the weaker dollar is help export  and overal profit is now rise  the tourist destin in the region are off to a strong start  and industri observ believ that traffic will easili exceed last year   s level   but group sale  main block of ticket sold to compani that use them for their employe  are down   hire at these tourist local has been much easier this year   and contact say that wage paid have remain flat for the third year in a row  but they are still abl to rais ticket price  one larg retail headquart in the district  feder  continu to struggl but seem to accept that their problem may well be simpli that their busi model  sn   t fit the current environ   anoth director who sit on the kohl   s depart store board alway provid a cheer and op ist report to offset the downbeat report that we get from feder   in retail categori  furnitur  applianc  electron  and jewelri are all report to be strong   in view of the low report level of inventori in these categori  retail are report fewer sale promot and markdown than a year ago at this  e  the hous market at the lower end of the price rang is report to be do veri well throughout the region while the upper end of the hous market is character general as be dead in the water   lot and lot of million dollar hous that were built don   t have owner or they have    upsid down    owner   the bankruptci of a larg residenti builder in the greater cincinnati area is creat a lot of problem becaus it involv a veri major fraud   we don   t know the magnitud of it yet  but it   s veri larg   so there are a lot of singl famili and multifamili hous project throughout the region that are unfinish and abandon   this has  caus at least three dozen bank to incur signific loss and has left more than      homeown with prior claim or construct loan against their hous   we think there is one bank whose surviv is veri much in doubt and two other whose capit has been sever impair  with respect to capit spend plan  even compani that are describ as sit on pile of cash   that   s the way their banker describ them anyway   have taken a wait and see attitud   and the reason given is that manag is still unsur how much product and effici can be wrung out of prior invest befor addit capac can be justifi  that rais an intrigu question   if at the micro level individu firm simpli claim not to know their potenti or their capac  how can we be veri confid about those measur at a macro level   it also say someth at the micro level of the firm   there must be a shift under way in     s law  and where it will end up we don   t know at this point  at a recent meet of our communiti bank advisori council  sever banker describ their busi custom as sound more pessimist than their action impli  nevertheless  it is general assert that busi custom continu to pay down old loan and are attempt to build liquid   the almost total absenc of report of either busi or  person bankruptci seem to surpris even the banker   it appear that there was a tendenc for each member to believ that his own bank   s experi was the except and that somebodi els must be incur a lot of loss   but nobodi claim that that was happen at his or her bank  let me turn to the nation economi   whatev the problem of various sector  region  or industri in this countri or whatev the problem plagu mani foreign economi  there certain are limit as to how far high expansionari monetari polici can go to be help befor go too far and becom part of the problem   at some point  and i tend to think it will be sooner rather than later  it is go to becom essenti for us to move to a more neutral stanc of monetari polici and to find the patienc to wait for other necessari adjust to work through the system  i want to say someth about the idea of risk versus uncertainti in the classic sens  risk  of cours  are at least potenti quantifi in some probabilist way   the staff   a good job of sensit us to the various risk to the econom outlook  and that   s veri help  but uncertainti are quit differ   we face an environ where the uncertainti are more import than the various risk that we can identifi   there are uncertainti associ with almost certain event in the middl east  but we cannot quantifi those uncertainti in ani use  way   there are uncertainti in the form of     enron    associ with the legaci of the last few year   how much of that has carri into the present and how long it is go to hang over this economi and our market is someth that i don   t find veri easi to contempl in a quantifi way   the implic for me is that we are go to be event driven and we are go to be reactiv for quit some  e  and in my view that   s the best that we can hope to do  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   frequent at recent meet i   ve describ our district   s econom pictur as mix   the inform we   ve receiv sinc the last meet of this committe in earli may i would describ as beyond mix   i   ve been look for anoth word      dual     sn   t quit do it   and mayb    schizophren    is as close as i can come to character it
how about    mix up       laughter
yes     mix up    is a good phrase   in ani case  what i mean by that is that there are strong negat and strong posit and not a lot of middl ground   the comment we   re hear on the posit side are similar to those a number of other peopl around the tabl have mention   manufactur look better and that has been go on now for sever month   even textil compani are continu to provid more op ist report   a contact at burlington told us that he thought the textil depress is now bottom out   we   ve had at least a few report at recent board meet and on discount rate call of some limit increas in plant capit expenditur   noth realli signific  but at least the news has been in that direct   hous activ is still veri robust in our district as elsewher   so those two sector especi   hous and manufactur   look pretti solid   and pick up on what michael   said  car sale seem to us to be reason healthi in most local in our region   but there has been a pronounc deceler recent in both household and busi spend for other good and servic   i would say this has been go on now over the last six to eight week  base on inform we pick up from the month survey we do on both retail and servic sector revenu   and district labor market remain relat soft  with unemploy rate increas in most district state  more broad   and this is perhap the most use thing i can say about the inform we   ve pick up from contact in our district   the comment i hear  even in social situat   are more downbeat now than at ani  e sinc the earli     s and mayb even sinc the earli     s   to a larg degre this probabl reflect the stock market declin  and hope it will prove temporari   but i have to say it get my attent and it worri me a littl   and my final point on the district economi is that our state govern have the same kind of budgetari issu as mani other state around the countri  on the nation outlook  the  book project hasn   t chang a lot from last  e  the staff revis it second quarter gdp project down a bit  but i gather  given what dave said this morn  that the latest data might offset that   so we have pretti much the same kind of forecast   one might argu  i guess  that a bigger downward revis might be merit in view of all of the pessim that we hear around the countri from a wide rang of contact   but as the  book point out and as a number of peopl underlin this morn  there continu to be a substanti amount of polici s ulus in play   so i think the staff forecast is still a reason forecast   there are obvious risk to the forecast  as alway   and i must say that i   m have more difficulti than usual tri to get a sens of where those risk might be balanc or in which direct they might be tilt  if they are tilt   mayb that has a bit to do with what jerri jordan was just say  the recoveri depend in larg part on continu growth in consum spend  sinc the resumpt of busi invest is probabl at least still some distanc away   in that regard  i think job market condit are go to be the key becaus consum confid will hing import on job and wage prospect   and as i see it  job and wage prospect in turn depend to a signific degre at this point on what i would describ as a hors race between structur product growth and the growth of demand in the near and intermedi term   in a balanc econom expans  over the long run demand grow at the trend rate of product growth  so in that situat the hors in a sens are run at the same pace   and  of cours  an  increas in trend product growth is alway a posit develop from that longer term perspect   but in the short run  if the product hors for a  e outpac the demand hors  unemploy could rise  wage and unit labor cost could fall  and we could see further near term disinfl  that could happen in come quarter   in the worst case scenario  that sequenc   if it were pronounc enough   could conceiv abort the recoveri   altern  if the demand hors get ahead  labor market could tighten  wage and unit labor cost could rise  and inflat could come back   and i think the comment by toni  tom  and other that we ought not to ignor that possibl are certain valid  current  as i see it  the two hors seem to be run about neck and neck in the sens that total hour work are about steadi   i see a littl disinfl pressur in labor market  but inflat is still broad stabl   so in my view it make sens to maintain our current polici stanc today   but as the belmont stake remind us veri dramat not too long ago  ani  hors can win in a hors race   so i think it   s import that we watch this situat with particular care in the near term
i hope the odd are not    to      laughter
but my point is that we can   t rule it out
yes  even at    to    i guess one can   t rule it out   it happen onc in seventi  e

thank you  mr  chairman   begin with the district economi  we have under way a gradual but what i think is by now a broad base improv in econom activ   residenti construct and sale  which have been a continu bright spot  remain a distinct bright spot pretti much throughout the district   consum spend continu to hold up reason well   and tourism in the district seem to be enjoy a good spring and earli summer so far   banker report that consum credit qualiti is in good shape   their report on busi credit qualiti are a littl more mix  but as far as the consum is concern  the banker seem fair comfort   we are see improv in manufactur activ and along with that some general improv   though i don   t want to make this too broad a statement   in busi attitud   i have been  if anyth  a littl pleasant surpris recent by report from busi peopl that they are see some pickup in activ   i   d say that there has been no signific chang in labor market condit for at least sever month now  commerci construct remain probabl the princip area of weak in our region   there  has been some improv in mine and energi sector in the district  as far as the nation economi is concern  for the most part i think the econom fundament are posit   so i find the case for continu expans convinc  especi  as other peopl have mention  with the polici s ulus in place and with sign of improv in mani foreign economi at least for the moment   for the near term anyway  i do believ inflat will remain subdu   and the product situat continu to look quit posit to me   as other have comment   and i may lean even a littl further on this side   the expans go forward is like to be modest  which we recogn to a larg extent is due to the fact that the recess was modest   we would not have been better off if we had had a deeper recess just so we could have a sharper snapback   final  though i don   t want to overst this  i do think that the current account issu are potenti a veri big deal becaus i believ they could have an extrem advers effect on confid   we use to be abl to take the accuraci of account for grant   we assum that these kind of problem  to the extent they exist  were characterist of develop economi or at least of economi other than our own   that is prove to be less and less true   and i   m afraid that there is real potenti for that to advers affect the economi  and not just in the short run

thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the southeast have remain subdu sinc the last fomc meet   although we are wit some  improv in manufactur and especi in the tourism and textil sector  consum spend has actual slacken off somewhat   with respect to tourism  florida seem to be rebound strong   cruis ship have been fulli book without the need to resort to the heavi discount that we had seen over the last sever quarter   singl famili hous remain healthi  but multifamili construct seem to be clear overbuilt   condit in the commerci construct sector  especi in atlanta  are even wors   offic vacanc rate are at    percent  and we   ve been told that it may take until      to absorb the current capac   but even that would requir a return to high level of growth and employ   this weak in the commerci market is show through in leas renegoti   one larg deal was recent complet for a twelv year offic leas with two year complet rent free   not surpris  new specul construct activ is virtual nonexist  in our discuss with our director this month  we focus on profit  invest  inventori  and labor market relat issu   profit are still be maintain main by continu cost cut and not by product increas invest or increas revenu  further  the major of our director report that their contact  which consist main of smaller compani  were larg unawar of the chang in the tax law design to s ul invest  and in those few case where firm were awar of the chang  the incent report were have no effect on decis to invest   as for larg compani  our contact at up indic that the tax chang were have virtual no effect on it invest decis  this was due in part to the fact that most of it major invest were tie to longer term contract and also becaus the window for take advantag of the chang was so long  clear  the persist of uncertainti and the effect it is have on inventori decis are quit tell   mani retail and manufactur indic they were in a wait and see mode  at least until after the fourth of juli   organ are simpli more will to run the risk of incur the ad cost of just in  e addit to inventori from domest sourc rather than risk place larg order with lower cost sourc abroad  base on high uncertain sale project  final  on the hire side  one bright note came from our contact in the grow southeast auto industri   he indic that auto produc had been generat    percent of their product output from over  for the past four month   if product is maintain at the current pace for a coupl more month   and he saw no reason whi it should not be   he said that they would like begin hire again   we did not find much of a strateg stori with regard to how temp worker are be use at this point   temp are be hire  but onli in conjunct with increas product and primarili as a hedg against the risk of further weak  in short  these anecdot stori suggest that growth in econom activ over come month is more like to be moder than robust and that invest spend is like to be restrain becaus of the percept of high risk and uncertainti   on the nation front  we share the view of the board staff that growth will be slight below potenti  at least through much of the rest of this year   our read of the data sinc the last meet suggest that there has been no materi chang in the baselin econom outlook  as a result  the same question we have had about the like path for the recoveri remain in place   inventori continu to be liquid  and there are few signal that an upturn in inventori invest is immin   the prospect for robust and rise corpor profit or invest activ have not improv   the factor that contribut to this mix econom pictur are also help to keep inflat at bay   mediocr growth rate for final demand and low rate of capac util will help to moder price pressur over the short run  a period of extend low interest rate is not unpreced   we experienc such a period in the         recess and into the subsequ recoveri   interest  a reread of the minut from that period suggest that the committe  prior to it initi move to tighten polici  had clear indic that the economi had turn the corner and was in fact expand strong   the committe move aggress in      onc the decis was made to combat ani sign of a rise inflat outlook   howev  there were unusu factor that were restrain both inflat and the economi to a larg degre   beyond those that are present today   as a result  although we may have some  e to monitor the econom outlook for the sign of strength and a durabl expans  inflat risk may not remain as dormant this  e around  we would note some import differ between the economi dure this slowdown and the         period   for exampl  unemploy is current much lower than it was dure      and        the level of econom activ is clear much higher than it was then  and the falloff in econom activ from the pre slowdown period has not onli been much less but is virtual nonexist in either consumpt or hous   product growth remain much stronger and has not exhibit the usual slowdown typic associ with an econom contract   the point of this is not to suggest that now may be the  e to act but onli to point out that it is not difficult to perceiv a circumst in which the economi could pick up quick and thus forc more aggress polici move   for now  though  it would simpli be nice to see growth return to level near potenti   thank you
sinc our last meet  we have more evid that the eleventh district is still in recoveri mode  but data and anecdot to date point to a disappoint weak and lacklust rebound   job growth from februari through may has been close to zero  and the texa unemploy rate has inch up to just over   percent   initi jobless claim were up again in may and  given robust labor forc growth in the state so far this year  i expect that the texa unemploy rate will continu to rise over the next few month   al   s product hors is outrun the demand hors   this has not been a typic busi cycl for texa in that the region   s perform has track the nation   s so close   as you know  in the past texa typic experienc bigger boom and bigger bust than the nation as a whole   that is not the case this  e   this is like the outcom of greater diversif  with reduc depend on energi and the fact that this most recent recess was not oil price driven or at least not exclus oil price driven  current  our older economi citi like houston have overtaken our newer economi metro  such as austin and dalla fort worth  in what is like a temporari but nevertheless strike revers of our experi over the past decad   houston has been particular buoyant in the last two month as a result of a stronger energi pictur  particular in natur gas  although gas price have come down somewhat in recent week  futur price still impli price closer to    by the end of the year   anoth posit develop for us has been the begin  of recoveri in mexico   we   ve done quit a bit of work to adjust the mexican data for this year   s earli ea    so in contrast to the offici mexican statist  our number suggest that mexico was out of recess in the first quarter  with gdp growth of posit     percent and with mexican export  import  and industri product all increas steadili sinc the begin of the year  the big question mark in our district are the high tech and telecom industri   we   ve had some posit develop outsid of telecom  such as increas export of comput and electron to asia   in the telecom sector  howev  it seem that bad news is follow by more bad news   as a result we   ve had no job growth and rise unemploy in both austin and dalla   commerci real estat market in these citi have deterior quick   anoth consequ of the high tech bust  as i look at the nation economi  i don   t see much in the month number to suggest an acceler in demand   but the continu posit result may have boost busi confid in the sustain of the recoveri   the weak of the recoveri is onli part due to the mild of the recess that preced it   the declin in industri product and capac util that we saw dure      and      were not small at all by histor standard  yet the rebound we   ve seen in these seri sinc decemb has been except modest   consum have certain been do their part  but it still seem that  go forward  they can   t continu to carri the whole load   if we   re to avoid a      style jobless recoveri  firm are go to have to resum their capit spend   fortun  the precondit for that to occur seem to be fall into place   and we are see increas in capac util  howev weak   corpor cash flow has begun to improv  and the stun product gain of recent quarter are hold down unit labor cost relat to price  all in all  i think we   re more like to see a replay of      than of        instead of an unemploy rate that rise a full percentag point after the recoveri begin  as happen a decad ago  the unemploy rate may waffl between     and   percent for an extend period of  e   if that is the case  then we   re not like to see ani acceler in inflat worth worri about any  soon  tighten at this junctur would  in my opinion  be prematur   we have met some of the precondit for a pickup in capit invest  but we have no hard evid yet that the pickup has begun   job growth has onli just turn posit  and increas in job keep get revis away   the recoveri is still veri weak and veri tentat   as confid that the  economi is on a healthi growth path increas  rate will have to rise  but that  e has not come yet
thank you  mr  chairman   the contact that i talk to emphas over and over again that the pictur has not chang veri much from the  e of our last meet   in fact  as i reflect on the situat  i can   t rememb an intermeet period in which less has chang in term of the overal outlook for the real economi  though obvious there have been  develop in the financi world that realli are newsworthi   to reinforc a point that some other have made  we  too  hear frequent comment about the weak condit of state and local budget   i think that probabl will be a factor depress spend by state and local govern for quit some  e  my contact at up  fedex  and wal mart all stress a notic chang in the labor market in term of a lower turnov rate or increas retent rate   full  e employe are not leav as frequent as they were in the past  and as a consequ  these compani are reduc the use of part  e help becaus they have more full  e employe   all of these contact point to that as be a mark chang in the situat over the last year   my up and fedex contact both said that they see some real sign of recoveri in asia and europ  with outbound traffic from those area clear pick up   the volum of shipment from the unit state to europ and asia  howev  is not pick up   my wal mart contact had an interest observ about argentina   he said that wal mart has about eighteen store in argentina  and with the bank system close  they have problem pay employe   they are send armor truck direct to the store and pay wage in cash  so  my wal mart contact said that thing were go fair well in argentina except for the financi and bank side   the level of activ  measur in term of the volum in their store  look okay  i think that   s about all i want to say in the way of a review of current condit   i would like to offer the observ that clear the economi is work through a number of adjust  especi on the financi side  in light of all the uncertainti about the account problem   we continu to get distress stori along that line there has been a signific declin in longer term interest rate   there is a self equilibr process go on   that declin in long rate is certain go to help to bol  hous and probabl consumpt through the tradit channel   or what have becom the tradit channel of refinanc and other mean of extract cash from increas home valu   that will no doubt provid some support for busi fix invest  it will encourag that to come along   when the environ improv and becom more buoyant  we will start to see rate on longer matur instrument go in the other direct   that will be part of a self stabil or self equilibr process as well   and it   s exact that process that make it  i think  easi and fulli appropri for us just to sit here and let the market do as much of that as possibl   i believ there   s no compel reason for us to chang polici until the under situat chang quit a bit   thank you
the discuss that we   ve been hear today is consist with the beig book summari that character econom growth as modest and uneven   or schizophren  as we said earlier   from late      until the last fomc meet  most forecast had been revis growth es  upward   sinc the last meet  we   re see more forecast for the remaind of      be revis down   consum have slow their pace of spend   busi fix invest still   not show sign of sustain recoveri   employ and averag week hour work have stabil   but i echo the concern that have been express mani  e alreadi today that issu about the integr of corpor earn are continu to overhang market and consum expect   on the posit side  i look at the increas in labor forc particip and the continu inventori liquid and sustain final sale of busi  which have brought inventori sale ratio to histor low level   product has grown for five month but at a pace below that necessari to maintain even the low current level of inventori  hous continu to be a bright spot in econom activ  and fiscal polici continu to be s ul  inflat remain at extrem low level  and ceo continu to lament their limit abil to increas price  the slow pace of employ activ and the pressur on profit continu to drive product to strong level   the sustain lower valu of the dollar  howev  will increas inflat pressur to some degre   thus  the modest pace of econom activ and the low level of inflat warrant no chang in econom polici today
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district   s econom perform has been mix  as we   ve been hear is the case in most part of the countri   there are some sign of increas price pressur in manufactur and real estat  but asid from shelter cost  finish good inflat has remain stabl and low   retail sale bounc back in june after a weak perform in may   consum confid has been rather mix  and labor market condit are as well  but overal both are fair steadi   the hous market in the district have been restrain  with price continu to rise but modest   offic market in and around new york citi remain weak but have stabil  and the hotel have report further increas in occup and room rate   our survey of manufactur and purchas manag suggest a mix perform in the manufactur sector in may   and banker in the district report some soften in consum loan demand but a pickup in demand from commerci borrow  tighter lend standard  and steadi to lower delinqu rate  on the nation level  our quibbl with the staff forecast are so minor as to not requir ani discuss   i   d like to comment on some of the view around the tabl that somehow we  have to prepar the market for what seem like an inevit tighten of monetari polici   i   m not sure who it is that we think we need to convinc of what   if the world outsid realli question the inflat fight skill and the willing of this committe to combat inflat  then i guess we   d have to go out and tri to convinc the world of that   but with the except of a few looni who write rather silli column   such as one in the wall street journal today   in order to make a live  nobodi question the abil and the willing of this committe to fight inflat when it need to be fought   it   s rather like babe ruth run around and say     i   m a great hitter     or lefti grove say    i   m a great pitcher      nobodi question their abil
i   m not sure everybodi around here would know who lefti grove is    laughter
he   s the greatest left hand pitcher in basebal histori   thirti one win and six loss in his best year  with a life  earn run averag of  about
is that a question mark at the end of that statement   laughter
he was a veri good pitcher   the point i wish to make is that we would be ill advis now to be prepar the market for someth that i don   t think the market need to be prepar for   our balanc of risk statement say that we think the risk are balanc   if we were to say that we think there is a greater risk of inflat  peopl would wonder on which planet we had taken up resid   we certain don   t need to postur ourselv as virtuous inflat fighter  that would seem to place in doubt whether we consid ourselv to be good inflat fighter when necessari   otherwis  whi would we be talk  about that   i have a posit in the world   s financi center that provid me with about a zillion intern contact   if anybodi were serious worri about our willing to take on inflat  i would sure be inund by such comment   i don   t get ani   so i would suggest  that we not get involv in a fight that nobodi think we need to engag in   there are some veri  veri serious problem out there  and we don   t need to contribut to them by place our own skill in question  the market continu to be pound by what appear to be an expand scandal in corpor america  lead a grow number of our fellow citizen   and even more foreign investor   to fear equiti invest in this market   a month ago i think one could have said that the corpor scandal were relat isol and that there weren   t too mani enron   just too mani are come to light for peopl to be abl to say that now   and the willing  despit all these develop  of the final four account firm to spend their consider skill on the hill tri to ensur that no legisl is pass that call for oversight of them   no oversight at all   indic a lack of common sens that is realli quit danger  the probabl of an intern financi crisi would be difficult to exagger  i think   argentina is as we have describ it in recent meet   brazil  in my view  is an ever grow danger   the question is not whether lula da silva would be elect presid of brazil   rather  it is whether the financi market in the countri  and especi the citizen of the countri  are go to sit around and wait to see what happen   if his lead in the poll continu  i think we have to stand by for a veri high probabl of massiv capit flight as we get closer to the elect   there is noth the imf or anybodi els can do about that   if the brazilian peopl decid that they   re go to vote with their money  the rest of the world will have to watch   but if that happen  the likelihood of a veri serious contagion effect on the world economi is great inde   for a while we could say that there was almost no contagion effect come out of argentina   that is no longer true   it may not be come out of argentina  but there is a fear in the emerg market area that is get consider greater  if we have an intern financi crisi  we are not in veri good shape to deal with it  we  the peopl of the unit state  are veri solid in support of our presid in the war against terror   but if you were to spend as much  e as i do deal with the intern communiti  you would know that the support of our tradit alli for our posit is weak at best   their attitud that the unit state is be unilater  which i think is a bum rap  is spread  and it take on a realiti of it own   if we have an intern financi crisi  the world is go to say that the present econom leadership team in the unit state has never been through such a crisi   any  that a group has not been through the handl of a crisi  there will be question about how good it will be at it   i hope and expect that this team would handl such a crisi veri well inde   but i think the world would expect the central bank of the unit state to take on the leadership role if need  as we did in the fall of      particular  and becaus of what i see as a veri murki and rather danger intern environ   and it could get quit bad inde    i think it is particular import for us to conduct ourselv in a way that indic our self confid   we need to show that we are sure of ourselv and confid in our own abil to manag domest monetari polici well and to manag our role in promot financi stabil as brilliant   a word well select  i think   as we have in recent year   it is not the  e to go around prepar the market for someth for which it  sn   t need to be prepar and in the process to place in doubt our confid in ourselv  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the latest j p  morgan newslett start off      global equiti market continu to slide this week  govern bond yield are fall  and the spread on emerg market debt is widen   such chang often signal that an econom slowdown lie ahead   howev  econom indic still point upward   a wave of recent report suggest that hous activ  along with retail spend and manufactur output  is re   acceler as midyear approach   this news is accompani by continu strength global in trade flow and manufactur output      this quot captur what other have call the schizophren situat face the economi   mani indic suggest that we are on track for a gradual recoveri   we are slowli work off excess inventori and fix invest is gradual come back   consumpt and hous remain strong   both the  book and blue chip forecast look for a gradual recoveri   and gradual is good becaus it reduc the expect amplitud of futur invest acceler cycl  look further into the futur  the so call    perfect foresight    path for the fund rate in the bluebook is not far from the scenario that i imagin most of us poor soul without perfect foresight would have in mind   and this path   lead to veri low level of inflat and unemploy   there are imbal  but even these are not too alarm  at least in the central  book forecast   both the dollar and the stock market had been overvalu accord to convent notion of equilibrium  but both are readjust   given all this   the gradual recoveri of the real economi  stabl price without much inflat threat  and the readjust of financi price that are out of line   what   s the problem   whi don   t we feel better about the  outlook  there are sever sourc of concern  which is bad enough   what is wors is that  compar with the good news  these disconcert factor could be fundament  are often unpreced  and are veri hard to analyz   i have five item on my list   one  of cours  is futur terror risk   we   ve talk enough about that here  second is the risk that gradual price movement will becom rapid price movement  the stock market may not be too far out of equilibrium now   forward earn price ratio have return to a decent margin over real interest rate   and the household wealth incom ratio is now much closer to it histor averag   but the market could well overshoot  as it often has in the past   the dollar  on the other hand  is mile away from it equilibrium valu   the one that equat import with export   a rapid chang there could have quit dramat implic  larg along the line of those just mention by bill    third is a long run eros of nation save   the budget situat is bad and get aw   the deficit is rise rapid  polit disciplin is gone  nobodi will make a vote in the public interest   as long run nation save declin  either invest will declin  or our foreign financ need will increas   and both are bad for quit differ reason  fourth is what the  book has euphemist call account irregular  which other peopl are call scandal   if these irregular were in fact irregular or abnorm  that would one thing   but they are look rather pervas to a lot of us  the fifth is interact  all of these risk involv potenti interact   if account firm are success in enabl busi and household to avoid tax  won   t this further erod the budget and nation save   will the account irregular lead to further and sharper fall in the stock market  the dollar  invest and or consumpt   will declin in invest demand  if ani  reduc a capit deepen product chang   still our best piec of econom news   and then further affect the dollar or the stock market or both   will the threat of terror interact with ani of these or all of these  so while we have an economi that is in some sens well posit for a gradual recoveri and while we could be on track for an outcom with lower unemploy and low inflat  there are my i forc out there   and those forc are difficult to analyz and could be quit omin and quit power   schizophrenia rule
thank you  mr  chairman   my view of the near term indic is that they do inde  as other have alreadi indic  paint an economi that is stabl   certain not contract   but not yet grow at trend   for exampl  the initi claim data have come  down from their recent artifici elev level  but they remain histor high   at around the         level that has prevail sinc earli        certain the most recent retail sale data were weaker than expect   flat in may   and are point to a possibl slow in the pace of increas in person consumpt expenditur   and final  the data for order and shipment  as we   ve just seen this morn  are clear stabil and perhap turn up some but certain are not return to the pace of the late     s  this pictur is frustrat  i think  for those who had hope for or bet on a sharp turnaround   but this committe should be mind  as mani have alreadi said  that the gradual growth of the current quarter was anticip in our earlier meet   two of the three previous  book this year forecast growth in this quarter within a rang of   to     percent  and  growth at such a pace still seem to be the case   while expect  howev  this slow growth   leav one wonder what will be the impetus for an upturn or return to trend   if the second half of      is go to be stronger than the second quarter and lead to a stronger       as forecast by both the staff and the consensus of extern forecast  we must soon start to see a pattern of more rapid improv incom data   while that pattern of data is not yet in hand  both hous and auto are continu to play the import stabil role that they   ve play thus far for the cyclic episod  addit  as other have said  impetus will most assur come from monetari  polici  which is accommod  fiscal polici  which is like to continu to provid a posit impuls  and a weaker dollar  which will allow foreign demand to take up some of the slack not provid by domest demand   on the other hand  erod equiti price  declin consum and investor confid due to a rang of factor that governor   has identifi  and an uncertain profit outlook in the busi communiti are admit creat and like to continu to creat some drag on both household and busi expenditur  all of these forc taken togeth lead me to believ that the risk to the baselin forecast are  if you will  uncomfort balanc   now  if contrari to most expect the negat forc weigh on the economi grow stronger  becom more persist  and undermin recoveri  then obvious we   ll have to react to that   similar  on the other hand  if the turnaround prove stronger than forecast  we   ll need to move rate upward more quick than current built into the assumpt under the  book or the perfect foresight outlook in the bluebook   whether such move will surpris the market is realli uncertain   just as the market have adjust in the intermeet period to the incom data by modifi their expect with respect to polici in a downward direct  presum incom data would get the market to adjust their polici expect up if inde that were the appropri respons  let me comment briefli on the issu that vice chairman   discuss and perhap take a slight differ tack   i think the issu of prepar the market is one that is rather challeng for this committe   we have the benefit of have the confid of the market that we will attempt to avoid surpris them if we can   that may not alway be possibl  but we will tri not to surpris them   we don   t want to lose that unwritten but rather well understood pact between this committe and the market   on the other hand  we don   t want a desir to prepar the market to lead inadvert to instabl in the market  which perhap was what vice chairman   was suggest   that   leav us in a bit of a challeng posit here   but for now i   d say it   s better just to have a steadi hand on the tiller  these are inde uncertain  e  and we don   t want to add to that uncertainti   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
we   ve had a coupl of comment regard the impact of public polici  and i think governor   summar it pretti well   in the cours of this past year we have had a s ul tax and spend polici offset   and signific  i think   by a loss of fiscal disciplin  which was an issu we discuss at the last fomc meet   presid jordan describ monetari polici as like to be event driven and reactiv   i would say that  from a pubic polici perspect  the effort for the rest of the year will be target and cautious  the elect year in america realli begin after labor day   in washington  d c   which is differ from america   laughter  it begin in midspr   the control of the senat is now perceiv to be in the hand of five state  three of which are agricultur state   south dakota  minnesota  and iowa   and it   s not surpris that we have in the congress a farm polici bill that  is target toward those state and  in turn  to achiev control of the senat   it seem to me that the one public polici decis that has been made   and this address what vice chairman   said regard the corpor govern issu   is that the account industri has lost it right to self govern   there will be an oversight board  in one form or anoth  that is larg out of their control   and that i would consid a cautious decis becaus it reflect what i believ is a consensus posit  i think the best exampl of public polici action in this  e frame is the inabl of the legislatur to pass a debt ceil bill  the govern is go to run out of money this friday  the senat has pass the bill   the republican in the hous are look veri hard at way to avoid address the issu direct   to me what that suggest is that  in the area of public polici  the decis will not contribut to the solut but will no longer be part of the problem   so perhap that  too  reflect where we are now  that a polici of no chang or a steadi as you go cours ought to be the one we follow

thank you  mr  chairman   the committe has note in it last few announc that the current stanc of polici is accommod  in larg part to signal that it appreci that the current level of the feder fund rate is like to be  inconsist over  e with it long term goal for price stabil and maximum  sustain growth   this polici stanc was adopt to counteract the effect of some veri power restraint on aggreg demand   most notabl the collaps of capit spend and the declin in equiti price associ with a re evalu of the demand for  and profit of  capit good   work through the imbal that built up in the second half of the     s has depress output and resourc util enough to put downward pressur on an alreadi fair modest core inflat rate   as the economi began to stabil late last year and to expand in recent month  the key polici question has been whether the adjust in the capit good sector and in expect profit has proceed suffici  or other countervail s ul forc have come into play  so that monetari polici should begin to move toward a more neutral set to forestal an eventu rise in inflat   in mani respect  the news sinc your last meet has support an assess that the adjust process has been progress larg as expect   the staff  anticip a slowdown in gdp growth along the line experienc  as the boost from the slower runoff in inventori wane and as growth in final sale moder after a surg in consumpt and govern spend in the fourth and first quarter  econom activ has continu to advanc  with industri output increas and labor market stabil   import  as highlight by the data this morn  invest spend   look as if it has begun to recov  suggest that the correct of imbal in the capit good sector is well along   core inflat has continu to moder this year  though by a littl less than anticip by the staff in the last  book   and longer term inflat expect remain relat low  inde  over the intermeet period  the spread between nomin and index debt revers a consider part of it previous run up   more unexpect in recent week have been develop in financi market  through the close of busi ye day  the dollar had fallen around   percent against other major currenc over the intermeet period  the broadest stock price index was down more than   percent  and most long term interest rate had fallen around   percentag point   to a consider extent  these asset price adjust have reflect a respons to econom news in line with the staff   s outlook for activ and earn  but short of the outsiz expect of market particip   it is import to emphas that  taken togeth  the net chang in asset price over the intermeet period should have veri littl overal effect on the path of econom activ and inflat go forward  at least when view from the perspect of the staff model   this result becaus the restraint on aggreg demand from the drop in stock market wealth is project to be about offset over  e by the boost to spend and product from the lower dollar and interest rate   but it seem evid that financi market are react as well to percept of heighten risk and uncertainti that have the potenti to damp spend in way that had not been anticip or built into the model   to some extent  these percept reflect the persist and possibl intensif of foreign conflict and of turmoil in key latin america economi  which are seen as pose a greater risk of spill over to the domest economi   the ad uncertainti also repres anoth linger hangov from the late     s boom   the exposur of question practic at an increas number of u s  corpor has rais question about govern and transpar at firm more general  reduc the confid with which investor can interpret recent histori and anticip the futur   greater uncertainti and skittish have been manifest in a mark increas in actual and expect volatil in a number of financi market   moreov  credit risk premium have jump in certain market segment and for the lower rate borrow who are perceiv to be most prone to corpor irregular and most vulner to more worri lender   clear  such market respons would tend to damp spend by the busi that now find the financi market less hospit   but heighten anxieti about the futur and about the cost and avail of financ could have much broader effect by make both household and busi more cautious  less confid  and less will to take risk in spend and invest   so long as the increas in uncertainti   not feed upon itself  the fundament remain in place for a strengthen of demand over come quarter for the reason present in the chart show ye day   with inventori sale ratio quit low  inventori invest should continu to contribut to increas in product    though not by as much as in the first quarter   growth in final demand should be bol  by expans monetari polici  which is keep real short term and long term interest

s ulus to final demand from fiscal polici is reflect in boost to dispos incom from tax cut  in larg increas in govern spend  and in greater incent to purchas capit equip that should begin to have signific effect over the next sever quarter   as depreci of the exist capit stock and expand sale continu to eat into ani remain capit overhang  the normal acceler process will begin to boost busi

forecast  nonetheless  the forc restrain spend lift onli gradual   not until next year   the economi expand at a rate fast enough to begin to make signific inroad into excess resourc   in effect  high margin of excess product capac  lower equiti price  cautious lender and spender  and moder expans in our trade partner mute the economi   s respons to s ul monetari and fiscal polici   as a consequ  in both the staff forecast and the perfect foresight exercis in the bluebook  hold the current accommod stanc of polici for a  e and rais the feder fund rate gradual thereaft is consist with maintain inflat near it current relat low level   keep polici unchang might have particular appeal when there is so littl histor preced to  judg the like path for spend as the economi work through the effect of the previous imbal in capit good and equiti market   with financi market skittish  core inflat still edg lower  and inflat expect well anchor  the committe might see littl to be lost by wait to get a better fix on how demand is like to evolv   the committe   s percept of the balanc of risk to the outlook at an unchang polici stanc might depend on how you weigh the various type of inform you receiv over the intermeet period   the passag of  e  togeth with the econom data consist with expect that invest was turn around  could impli that the odd on econom expans fall short had declin and that inflat risk had drawn closer   perhap to the point where the latter now were the more import threat to meet your longer term object   the belief that the foreign exchang valu of the dollar was like to be trend substanti lower over a consider period would reinforc such a judgment   in contrast  should concern continu to mount about global polit and econom develop and about the true state of financ of u s  corpor  the result caution could cut into spend   inde  a few observ have read recent financi market develop as rais the odd that your next action is more like to be an eas than a tighten  suggest the possibl that the balanc of risk had tilt toward econom weak   and in fact  financi market this morn have built in some odd of an eas in the octob novemb  e frame   in the staff forecast  these greater uncertainti have not undermin the judgment that fundament forc will be strengthen the expans and that polici will need to tighten at some point  but they have push off the date at which inflat risk will requir firm to begin   if the committe share the assess of the staff that heighten inflat pressur are no closer now than they were in may  presum it would retain it assess that the risk to it object are balanc   this is what the market expect  and the announc of an unchang polici along with balanc risk should have littl effect on asset price   the heighten degre of unsettl in financi market most recent  includ this morn  might strengthen the argument for not surpris market particip at this meet unless the committe saw polici expect now embed in asset price as serious misguid and potenti destabil   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   question for don   presid parri
first of all  i think the perfect foresight exercis  both in the bluebook and also in the memo by bob tetlow were veri help   i have a coupl of question with regard to those exercis   page   of the bluebook  about the seventh or eighth line down  talk about the object function as minim the squar deviat of output from it potenti   is that correct   i ask becaus i think tetlow minim squar deviat of the unemploy rate from the nairu and that make a differ   in this latest recess  of cours  the deviat of output from it potenti realli didn   t becom veri great  but the deviat of the unemploy rate relat to the nairu was quit larg   so  is there a differ
i think they were about the same  but mayb vinc can give you a more detail explan
you are right  bob   s memo highlight that it was unemploy relat to the natur rate
so did you run a differ model simul
no  actual we ran the same one
oh  okay
howev  go forward in the forecast      s law relat the two  so it  sn   t make a differ
but the relationship   i think we ought to talk about that   in other word  you didn   t put it in the right term   this should be
unemploy relat to the natur rate
that   s what i thought the answer was   thank you
i do think that in the staff   s assess there isn   t much differ go forward becaus in the staff forecast the nairu is    percent
right  but in the most recent period it   s differ   my second point is that you talk about the small penalti associ with chang in the fund rate   in tetlow   s work i thought it had almost an equal weight   and that   s pretti import in term of the object function   unless you use a differ penalti  i don   t see how you could character it as a small penalti
no  the bluebook simul is exact the same as the one bob present
so it give a heavi weight to smooth chang in the fund rate  that   s the way he character it
the penalti is our dirti littl secret
you got it
it isn   t obvious whi in a perfect foresight simul we would necessarili impos that the committe care about gradual in set rate
we do it for a coupl of reason   one is the character of uncertainti   second  the model has a properti that it give us a small contemporan effect of monetari polici   that is  if you chang the fund rate this quarter  it will actual influenc output in this quarter   that  sn   t seem credibl   so gradual has the effect of take that out   whether that is small  medium  or larg  it was chosen so that we would get the histor fund rate volatil
it   s all relat to the other
one final question   you refer to the growth rate of potenti as    percent after        tetlow use     percent  and in fact it build to abov     percent after that   did you use a differ simul there
we were use the same simul   now  bob   s memo was written a week befor the  book was final   so  it must reflect either a chang between the  e the two exercis were done or a differ round convent
okay  thank
i don   t think there were ani chang in the model itself
i have a comment on page    of the bluebook   the box that discuss the market reaction to polici surpris   i think there   s a lot more that could be done in that exercis  in particular  i think there   s a better way of do tabl   versus tabl     instead of partit the data by date  i   d use the size of the polici surpris as measur by the chang in the feder fund futur market   a chang of   basi point or less realli is no surpris  but a chang of   basi point or more would be   that would be a better way of present this analysi
in fact  i think we did someth similar to that with a differ rang  this analysi is basic a work in progress   i would say that we were influenc by the reaction to the januari          action  which was certain not in the   basi point or less cell
that   s absolut right   that   s whi i   m suggest that you partit these observ   i use   basi point becaus our research indic that that   s about the ambient nois in the feder fund futur market
we have ongo research that involv look at the differ measur of expect   and it   turn out  whether you use the feder fund futur  the eurodollar  or a term structur that you can tweak these number a littl bit
further question   if not  let me get start   i   ve been particular impress  and other have as well  by how this economi has withstood the extraordinari impact of the dual shock of a major collaps in equiti asset valu and the tragic event of septemb      i think it   s import  howev  not to perceiv the economi   s resili as an either or issu   in other word  the economi either deflect these shock  or it  sn   t   if a person has a flu bug that put him or her to bed for a week  that person is serious ill   the altern as it appli to the economi in the current context is that it is suffer  but it is not in bed   and i think it is go to take a while  mayb mani month  befor the linger effect of what the economi has essenti deflect actual wear off   as i see it  a good part of the restraint on econom activ that we see pretti much across the board is the after effect of these shock   they have been veri substanti shock   in this context  the big rise in gdp in the first quarter as a consequ of the sharp slow in inventori liquid is mere an arithmet inevit  it is not someth that give us ani realli great insight into ongo econom process  what character this period in my view is that global is begin to have a general effect on the competit structur of the world   s economi   it essenti has open up the world market to a lot of local area with excess capac   when there are local area that cannot trade with one anoth  a higher level of aggreg capac is need to accommod rise demand   the consequ of homogen the world economi  which is effect what global    has veri clear been to exert a mark deflationari forc on the price structur of the world   mere look at the rate of inflat as it gradual came down through the     s is tell us that we are see a veri broad forc that is exert it econom effect relat slowli   i   d like to think that in some way the monetari author of the world were extraordinarili clever and that we calibr this process precis in the way it happen   i don   t believ that for five second   i think we have been veri fortun in have essenti recogn the process as it was occur and have calibr our action to profound import event   and the reason they are profound import  even today  is that this is a differ kind of recoveri from those we have seen befor   to a veri larg extent  it   s character by the loss of price power   what that essenti mean is that we are not see the recoveri characterist that we have observ in the past in which inflat got down to a low rate of  say    percent and then start to move back up   this recoveri is differ  it   s differ larg becaus the busi communiti deal with nomin valu   busi firm are face consolid corpor revenu that are basic flat in nomin term  and even if the price level is fall or the rate of inflat is come down  busi execut who are in  charg of capit invest remain skeptic about indic of an emerg upturn   we clear are get a veri differ pattern of real gdp as a consequ  the fact is that we have gotten some firm in the order seri despit the pervas gloom in the busi communiti   cathi   reflect on the extent to which her busi contact talk about this gloomi sen ent   we are all see it  and given it pervas  it is  difficult to imagin whi ani invest is take place   but busi firm are in fact invest  if the chart in front of us cover more year  we would find that the current order figur are higher than they were in ani recent period except for the year      through        they have come down veri sharpli  but we have to rememb how far they had gone up  so the current level relat to where they were in the past is realli quit high   the question is how that squar with the gloom that permeat much of the busi communiti   the reason they are spend is that they perceiv they need to   the onli peopl who are make ani capit invest  if you listen to what busi execut are say  are those who have no choic   it appear from the data that there   s an aw lot of nonchoic out there   there is no doubt that the number on invest outlay look better than what busi execut are say  and i think that   s import  i think it   s also import to reflect on whi this period differ from  say  the     s and     s  which also was a period of low price inflat   back then  the popul was grow at about twice the rate it is today  and nomin valu also were grow fa  than they are today  we usual don   t consid popul growth to be an issu  but it   s relev in this case   i recal that capit invest was do reason well in the     s and     s   profit were do reason well   sale were do reason well   with the popul and the labor forc grow much fa  than they are now  hous start began a long term uptrend from the begin of the post   world war ii period  the impetus for rise hous activ usual focus on household format  and that   s not what we   re get today   i   ll come back to that short becaus it has consider relev to what is go on current  there is no question that the issu of corpor govern and account practic has erod the level of confid  and more so than i expect it would   one cannot escap the conclus that some of what has gone on within a number of larg corpor probabl has involv some feloni and that inevit somebodi is go to jail   even so  it   s hard to say that corpor effici  which is realli the ul  measur of the effect of corpor govern  is weaken   on the contrari  all the evid we have from the product data indic precis the opposit   what it also is say is that the fear in the marketplac about the qualiti of earn is a short term fear   the reason is that there are certain fundament number in our system that  if we believ them and i think that we do  mean that under product is inde rise   one cannot spin the product data that we are work with  inde      provid altern and independ es  of what is happen  and they all show the same thing   that it is veri difficult to deni that output per hour has acceler   it   s also veri difficult to deni that unit labor cost have either level out or fallen  one may argu that price are go down in the corpor sector  and in part that may be correct  but sever deflat is evid in none of the data   as a consequ  profit margin  as reflect in the nipa  have been recov   it   s import to keep in mind that the nipa profit number are not capabl of be spun under gaap and they are not capabl of be misrepres by off balanc sheet analysi   when i ask myself whether there is ani way in which one can spin the nation incom and product account profit figur  the answer is    yes       in part   the    in part    relat to the fact that the under sourc data use by the bea may veri well be question to a degre   but there are quit signific limit to how far that can go   at the end of the day  the nipa profit figur are base on the tax return that corpor put out   there is no evid of which i   m awar that corpor tax return report is defici or suspect   there is no evid that i   m awar of that the ir has found huge account misreport for tax evas and tax avoid purpos   the truth of the matter is that the amount of avoid that a busi firm can engag in is limit   that mean that the nipa data in general are probabl quit reflect of what is go on  and those data show a lot higher profit growth than do the recent sharehold report   part of the reason for that  as i have argu in the past  is that the non expens of stock option  which was a major factor in the widen spread between sharehold s p     earn and the nipa earn from      through       is now revers   and it   s revers in the sens that  with the fall in the stock market  the willing of employe to take stock option grant in lieu of cash has gone into veri signific retrench   that mean that cash  which is expens  is take the place of stock option grant  and that   s depress s p     earn relat to those in the nipa data   the latter  of cours  alreadi have a form of expens in them as is requir under the tax code  my suspicion is that if the number we   re look at are reason and if the gdp data that     was talk about this morn are go to be revis as he suggest  we are look at a product number of around    percent at an annual rate for the second quarter   by itself  that is not huge remark  but it is huge remark in the sens that it would follow annual rate of   percent averag over the two previous quarter   one would have expect a negat second quarter mere becaus it   s just not credibl that those   percent number can be repres of the trend in the real world   the fact of the matter is that there appear to be someth veri real go on   and if it is and if compens of employe is not pick up all of the gain in product  as clear it is not  then of necess the product gain have to flow over into profit margin unless we see serious evid of acceler deflat or actual price declin in the corpor sector   there is littl of that becaus the reason good data that we have for manufactur price do not show veri much deflat  except for the high tech sector   the latter  of cours  has been character by persist fall price   inde  that   s one of the reason whi in the present environ we have veri slowli move nomin gdp that is associ with reason good real gdp  in my view  the problem with profit is go to cure itself   i nonetheless think that a lot more shoe probabl will fall in the disclosur area   the worldcom episod is bizarr  includ the huge loan that the compani made to berni ebber   i serv on a lot of board of director befor i arriv here   the notion that we director would author huge loan to the chief execut offic is so far from anyth that i even remot encount at that  e as to indic that someth in the area of corpor govern clear has broken apart   it   s not that human greed has somehow inexplic and sudden escal after stand at a fair pronounc posit but measur level for millennia  what has happen is that the exploit opportun for greed have gone up veri substanti with the huge bonanza in market capit sit out there as a potenti free lunch with no appar offset liabil   some of the practic that busi firm are engag in are utter bizarr   so there are bound to be further revel relat to such practic  and i don   t know how long this problem will last  i see evid that the capit good market are reflect slight improv profit   i   m a littl dubious about the report that the legisl provid for acceler depreci is have no effect   it is true that if one survey corpor execut  mani will say  that they never heard of it in term of their firm    invest decis   but that   s not where the invest decis is made   it   s made at the plant level   if a plant manag has a potenti project to be present to the capit facil plan committe of the compani  that depreci chang will be includ in the calcul of the project rate of return   it will influenc the total amount of the capit expenditur even if the chief execut offic think it has zero effect   he just  sn   t know  and the reason he  sn   t know is that it seldom surfac at the execut committe level or at the board level   that   s not the way depreci chang and replac demand get generat within a corpor   to be sure  compani execut and the board of director do vote on the overal capit appropri  but they do not and cannot know what is in the detail in ani meaning respect   as i see it  the outlook for capit good spend is probabl okay   the depress among busi execut is so great that capit spend presum can onli go higher from what is current a relat elev level    gloom adjust     if i may put it that way  person consumpt expenditur were weak in may   obvious  the data we have through june are mix  but the month as a whole still look to be reason posit   chain store sale  of cours  have been quit impress   the onli problem i have with such sale inform is that  even though we have the report on a week basi  their actual use in forecast total person consumpt expenditur is dubious   we clear are get some increas  as     mention  in motor vehicl sale in june   the redbook chain store es  and forecast are less grim than those of the bank of tokyo mitsubishi  but neither one of them is as use as the motor vehicl data   the latter includ all car sale and are almost exact what show up in the pce and the pde for these key sector   these motor vehicl statist are therefor of crucial import in gaug overal consum spend   to be sure  the growth of consum spend will be a good deal weaker in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter  i believ that equiti extract from home will continu to be a sourc of posit growth in person consumpt expenditur   if we disaggreg the model that we use  we find  that littl more than    percent of person consumpt expenditur is financ out of incom in the short run   the implic is that a big chunk  near    percent of outlay  is driven by the stock of overal wealth  of which hous is a veri import part   in this regard  i think we are all awar of the fact that  despit the weak in the economi  homebuild has been remark well maintain   a clear reason for that in my view is immigr  which current account for a third of u s  popul growth and a third of the rise in household format  the demand for hous is press up against land shortag and the like  and we are get fair dramat increas in a lot of area in the market valu of home and henc in the total hous equiti  from which there has been a consist degre of extract   one sourc of the extract is the veri high level of exist home sale   the seller pay off signific less mortgag debt than the buyer take on  and the net chang in those two mortgag number equal  the extract of equiti from the sale of exist home  the fund made avail from home sale plus the fund obtain from the veri larg increas in home equiti lend  which stem from    unreal gain    that are not the consequ of a sale of a home  are be employ to a signific extent for consum expenditur   of cours  a further sourc of such fund come from cash out from home refinanc  which as i recal are an increas proport of the   aggreg amount be refinanc   the impact of the veri substanti extract of home equiti fund is to lower the level of measur person save   but that is not the true measur of the save rate becaus we are deal with a structur differ in person consumpt expenditur as a consequ of a secular rise in home equiti valu   i don   t know where i saw the recent chart show chang in the real valu of home over the past coupl of decad     was that in your present
we had a panel on that
it   s fair evid that there is a secular increas in the valu of home relat to the valu of other asset   the consequ is that the extract of fund from home equiti valu is a much more import sourc of consumpt expenditur than earlier   previous  consum were not abl to extract cash easili out of the rise valu of their home  but they can now  and that sourc of fund has been a strong sustain forc for spend through the recess   unless immigr slow down as a consequ of septemb     it   s hard to imagin that anyth realli major is go to chang in this regard   and unless we get a signific declin in home price  and that   s a veri question prospect at this stage  it   s hard to imagin that there will not be veri consider ongo support for consumpt expenditur come out of the hous equiti market  a real concern lurk in the background  which we have great difficulti evalu  is the potenti implic of chang in the foreign exchang rate   i know that everyon has a firm belief regard exact which way the dollar is go to go   all i can tell you is that the histori of exchang rate forecast indic a greater degre of confid in forecast such rate than there has been success   laughter   exchang rate trader will tell you that they make money onli in marketmak   in their bid ask spread   i rememb that month after month when i was on the j p  morgan board i would see a line in their report indic foreign exchang capit gain   and i kept ask myself how in the world they manag to do that   i knew how difficult it was   final  they all    fess up      they admit that they forecast bad   they hadn   t a clue   but they were marketmak  and their spread were veri effect in produc what was in essenc servic incom for facilit foreign exchang transact   in fact  the vast major of commerci transact involv a loss larg becaus of transact cost   stock price tend to trend higher over  e becaus of inflat plus the capit gain that result from the accumul of undistribut profit  but that trend   not exist for the exchang rate  which is trendless by definit  the general view that everybodi know exact where the exchang rate is go  i think  is an illus   i don   t deni  as ned   say  that the dollar is veri sever out of sync with the intern trade account   but it   s the portfolio account that are crucial  and the issu here is whether we realli know that the dollar is out of sync   i don   t think so   are we go to forecast that it is go to depreci   yes   whi are we go to do that   becaus the current account deficit is veri larg and the recent trend has been a depreci   and i can tell you that you will get veri strong agreement on that outlook   if one goe back histor and review exchang rate forecast  one will find that the forecast of exchang rate is as close to a random process as forecast ani econom variabl that i know   so i   m not of the school here that is bemoan what may happen to the dollar becaus i realli know that i don   t know  it   s veri hard for me to hold that convict  but i   m work on it    laughter  i do think that the problem in latin america  which bill   mention  are a sleeper here   it   s not onli argentina and brazil that are in serious shape  clear venezuela is as well   their difficulti all involv polit problem   they have noth to do with econom  i would add colombia for the same reason   these are big countri in south america   now the  question is whether there will be contagion   i   m not sure   in fact  i don   t know what contagion basic mean in this particular situat     polit contagion spread   it may  but i   m not sure in which direct   for exampl  i don   t know what will happen if peopl see that brazil is brought to it knee becaus of a populist campaign   fortun  i gather   especi after listen to bob     that mexico seem to be do well   if that is inde the case  that is  good   but mexico is still a third world countri  it may belong to the oecd or whatev  but they still have polit problem   the latter are not as sever as they use to be  and their sever appear to be diminish   hope  their economi won   t get pull down by develop in the rest of latin america   but i gather  bob  that there are no sign of that at this stage  is that right
in sum  there are serious problem out there   we don   t know how to evalu them   we   re still wait for the next terrorist attack  which at some point  is inevit   we have no idea where it will come or what the consequ will be  but that someth will happen somehow has to be factor into our forecast   it   s an oper risk  as we like to say in bank   but we don   t have a clue what it is   it has to be have some effect on the economi  and inde i   m sure it     in ani event  i think we   re go through a veri extraordinari period   preced help  but not a great deal   i think we are fortun posit so far as monetari polici is concern at the moment   i don   t envisag a need for us to make a signific move either way for the period immedi ahead   and sinc we can call an fomc meet with twenti minut of lead  e  we realli don   t have to commit veri far in advanc to do thing  on the issu of tri to alert the financi market that we may be firm  i don   t think that   s necessari  if for no other reason than that they   ll be well ahead of us in that regard   if we begin to get the type of data that would inclin us to move  it   s alreadi go to be reflect in the feder fund futur market   that   s the way these market work   they are veri sophist   there have been except   obvious back in januari we tri to persuad the market  which had us move up the fund rate veri rapid  to take anoth look   that was a rare event   i don   t think that   s go to be happen this  e   if anyth  we may again find that the veri low level of the nomin fund rate is go to trigger anoth increas in the forward market as soon as the economi turn around   i don   t think there   s go to be veri much of a job for us in ani effort to convinc them that we   re go to move   and inde we will move becaus clear the pall that   s still hang over the economi from the stock market declin will dissip at some point   at this point it is not over   at least it  sn   t quit look like it   s over  although the economi display mani of the characterist of a climax bottom  the troubl is there are more climax bottom than there are bottom  so it   s a veri unusu outlook   i guess one can say that they all are  but i would say we are fortun in that we are posit  plus and minus  for it   certain at this meet i think we can afford to stay where we   ve been   and i would say the risk are balanc  and i would recommend that we stay there   i do not deni that event can chang quit quick   that includ  a likelihood that the economi may weaken further  but there   s also a likelihood that we may be surpris by a lot fa  recoveri than we are forecast   i think we have to be prepar for either case   my own impress is that it will take a lot to make us move the fund rate still lower   it won   t take a huge amount to make us move in the other direct   vice chair

i also support the recommend
i support it as well
i do  too
i support it
i don   t want to inhibit anybodi from talk   we have plenti of  e   presid
i support the recommend as well   i must say i was drawn to the way roger   describ the situat   as an    uncomfort balanc of risk      i feel veri much that way also
i think that   s an accur way to character it  clear  presid broaddus
i support your recommend
i support the recommend
i support your recommend   i do want to make one comment   i agre with you that we have a lot of credibl in the market   but i think a good part of that credibl has been achiev becaus we have been open with the market   and what you   re say today is that we would have a balanc risk statement but we   re not quit sure the risk are as balanc as the statement is go to say
well  i think they are balanc at a    percent feder fund rate
my concern is  given where we are  that we   re send the messag that the economi is go to grow and yet we   re hold the fund rate down at a veri low level   i think that deserv some explan   that   s my point go forward
i would just say that i think global has alter the  situat to an extent   it   not elimin the fact that we will have to move   if protection realli start to becom a problem here  it could turn the global issu to our disadvantag  my point is that we don   t have to be anxious move ahead of the curv becaus i think the market will be right along with us   at least they have been to a great extent   first vice presid barron
i support the recommend
i support the recommend   i don   t have ani troubl say that the risk are balanc  but i won   t say that the uncertainti are balanc becaus that would be an oxymoron   and in my view we do have to think about that
good point   governor
i support the recommend   i   d like to clarifi one point   i was not buck for a job on the fed   s foreign exchang trade desk   perhap i was speak as a convert sinner  at least in the jimmi carter sens    laughter   i actual went through a phase over the intermeet period where i was question our convent notion of what is equilibrium in the intern account  and   and other have persuad me that their notion is correct   by that standard the dollar is  as i said  mile away from equilibrium   when ani price is that far from equilibrium  i would have to say that there is more risk to the situat than would otherwis be the case
i would agre with that   we   ve heard from everybodi
