good afternoon  everybodi   today  as mani of you know  is dave     s last meet befor he retir in august     has been attend feder open market committe meet regular sinc        realli   that  sn   t show good judgment    laughter   and he has been a member of the board   s staff go all the way back to        dave has just complet a studi entitl    a modern histori of fomc communic     which is at your place   it is date as of today so it take us right to the present   i   m anxious to know whether we   ve becom clearer communic as  e has gone on      anyway  we all thank you veri much for your extraordinari servic to this institut and we wish you well in your futur endeavor    applaus
mr  chairman  i have a question   after he leav are we allow to talk to him about this paper    laughter
after one year   would somebodi like to move approv of the minut of the may   meet
without object they are approv   we turn now to mr  reinhart and mr  kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi call    conduct monetari polici at veri low short term interest rate    which was on the tabl when you came in   it   s the same as the materi i sent to you electron last week   i   d like to start on a person note  though   i was in line at midnight on friday with my    year old son to purchas harri potter and the order of the phoenix   at     page it is somewhat longer than the brief document the committe has receiv   but it  too  consid an altern world fill with uncertainti and great peril       the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     as the top panel of your first exhibit make clear  the current nomin feder fund rate of    percent place the committe in a region it has not been in a half centuri   in our brief this afternoon  dino and i will tri to provid some background to help you map a rout across that unfamiliar terrain   i shall address aspect of the conduct of monetari polici at veri low short term interest rate  emphas the option avail to you through open market oper and communic polici   toward the end of my brief  i shall also touch upon a broader rang of polici possibl  includ the aggress use of the discount window   dino will then discuss specif option as to how the domest desk might implement polici should you decid to move away from the current approach of set a target exclus for the overnight feder fund rate   i will close out the staff present by ask a seri of question to get some guidanc from the committe about prioriti go forward   how much urgenc you attach to the issu depend on the interact of your view on the likelihood and cost of deflat  where the feder fund rate will be over the next few month  and the cost in term of market function attach to veri low short rate   we decid to cut this gordian knot in the follow way   as to the first in the list  the divis of research and statist forward a memo to the committe last week on the subject of deflat  and aspect of that will be discuss in the chart show by     later this afternoon   we suggest that you put off to the greatest extent possibl ani discuss of the appropri set of the current short rate until tomorrow   the middl panel of your first exhibit open my brief with the issu of the direct cost associ with a low overnight nomin interest rate view from the perspect of the function of financi market   this was also the subject of a memo that the committe receiv last week  but i   d like to start from a differ perspect than in that document becaus i am afraid that cognit disson may have set in alreadi   accord to a veri influenti paper that milton friedman publish in       a low nomin interest rate impos no cost but onli benefit   in friedman   s framework  an overnight interest rate of zero is op  becaus it impli that societi   not wast devot resourc to econom on transact balanc   while the exampl of japan strong suggest that a zero rate environ creat other difficulti  his perspect is instruct in that what mani peopl call cost of low short rate are actual relat to the unwind of scheme design to make hold transact balanc less burdensom   that said  it is import to rememb that the economi would bear adjust cost twice   onc as interest rate fall and these scheme are unwound and then when they are built up again as short term interest rate ul  revert to more normal level   with that in mind  the first of the three cost list is the problem of compress rate   by that i mean that the overnight feder fund rate regular exceed some other money market rate  includ those on liquid deposit  mani money market mutual fund  and collater financ in the rp market   were the overnight feder fund rate to fall  those other instrument would have less room to preserv their typic spread   in addit  the incent for sharp pencil reserv manag to trade fund in the market would diminish as the overnight rate fall  probabl thin broker in the market   two oppos point are worth note   first  the high cost provid of intermedi servic in the money fund industri will be the one feel the initi pinch   perhap those are the firm that should appropri lose out in the darwinian competit for scarc resourc   second  there was an activ feder fund market in the     s  but after the subsequ two decad of low overnight rate  it wither away and was not to reviv until the earli     s   overal  my read of the staff memo is that these two cost are inflict on onli narrow segment of financi market   still  troubl in even a narrow segment of the market can get quit a lot of attent in the media  potenti elev the concern of the broader public about the economi and financi intermediari   a more serious concern  also one about percept  is that a central bank that eas polici to the point that short rate were veri low might be seen by the public as have run out of ammunit   that is  low rate risk fo  the mis impress that monetari polici is ineffect   to ward off this risk  the committe may want to communic to the public go forward that there is a conting plan and that it   not envis monetari polici becom impot   the remaind of my brief will examin polici altern that may help to ensur that monetari polici remain potent  begin with the discuss of the implement of polici in exhibit     to start with the most obvious point  monetari polici action are put in place by alter the feder reserv system   s balanc sheet  a simplifi form of which is present in the shade area   over the year  the feder reserv has acquir a signific volum of treasuri secur  about two fifth of which is held in bill and three fifth in note and bond    our relat small hold of index debt are not shown separ    also note that we   re not current much in the lend busi  as discount window credit typic run under      million   in principl  the feder reserv can spur econom activ by increas the overal size of it balanc sheet   that is  by blow up it liabil through some combin of open market purchas of secur and discount window lend   such chang are reflect direct in the overnight feder fund rate until it is driven to zero   at that point  the quantiti of reserv can still be increas  but ani effect will have to show up in place other than the price of overnight reserv   addit  chang in the composit of the balanc sheet   the mix of long tem and short term asset held   potenti could influenc risk premium   polici regard both the size and composit of the system   s balanc sheet could also influenc expect about the futur path of polici   that is  expect about how the size and composit of the balanc sheet will chang over  e   equal as import as how the committe chang it polici is how that impetus is transmit through the economi  the subject of exhibit     in particular  as outlin in the   box  the princip channel of transmiss of monetari polici to spend is through the price and return of long live asset   in turn  those return depend on the current and expect futur path of short term interest rate as well as risk premium   monetari polici would have an addit lever on spend if  as some economist argu  the quantiti of liquid has an effect on spend independ of it influenc on the current overnight interest rate   three somewhat overlap form of monetari polici s ulus are impli from this general principl as list below   the feder reserv can provid impetus to the economi at an unchang current short term interest rate by encourag investor to expect short rate to be lower in the futur than they current anticip and by shift relat suppli to affect risk premium    if the overnight rate is alreadi zero  the feder reserv may be abl to provid addit impetus to the economi by oversuppli reserv at the zero fund rate   i   ll now give a bit more detail about such polici in turn  but it will becom veri evid that ani individu polici share element of these three mechan   i term the first polici    shape interest rate expect     as at the top of exhibit    becaus the price of long live asset depend on the current and expect futur short term interest rate  if the feder reserv could encourag investor to lower their interest rate expect  the economi might receiv a boost   but how can the feder reserv encourag lower interest rate expect   one possibl approach would be to offer some form of commit to the public   an exampl of an uncondit commit is pledg to hold short term rate at a low level for x period of  e   in an environ where investor were expect tighter monetari polici  s ulus would take the form of lengthen x and would presum pass through the yield curv and other asset price   the middl panel show how that might work   the solid blue line at the left plot the path of the expect short term interest rate deriv from a two factor model fit to the swap yield curv as of two week ago    note that this view polici over a much longer period than the futur base measur we usual show the committe    the correspond swap yield curv is plot in a similar manner in the right panel   the long blue and short red dash line at the left contraven the dynam of this model to hold the expect short rate at it current level for the next one and three year  respect  after which it return to that predict by the model   the consequ for swap yield are shown at the right   the convinc promis to keep the short rate at it current level for the next year onli nudg the term structur lower  probabl becaus polici rate expect are alreadi subdu for the immedi futur   a three year standstil on rate hike has a more dramat effect on yield  pull swap rate in the three to five year sector   percentag point to   percentag point lower   while such effect may be signific  the realiti of policymak is that a promis would not like be convey as stark as an explicit commit to keep rate low as measur in x year   rather  through the committe   s statement and the speech and tes oni of member  the messag could be sent that the polici rate would be kept low for a while bar some major unanticip shock   even then  given the varieti of shock that have hit the u s  economi over the past few year and the imponder critic to the outlook  the committe might be reluct to tie it hand by make an uncondit promis about it futur action potenti far into the futur  no matter how vagu and nuanc   an altern would be to make a promis link not to the calendar but to some econom event   under a condit commit  the committe could pledg to hold short rate at a low level until some event y happen   possibl trigger event would includ post sustain econom growth  make progress in trim econom slack  and record inflat abov a specifi floor   the yellow warn sign along the road to a commit strategi is that word ul  have to be match by deed for the public to believ the committe   that is  shape expect   not introduc anoth polici instrument in the long run   moreov  the committe might be concern about it credibl in deliv on it promis  as one exampl  you might be concern about establish a target rang abov the current rate of inflat if you thought there was a reason risk that the actual outcom for inflat will move lower for the next few year   as anoth exampl  the committe might be worri about it credibl in the other direct if a focus on a backward look indic of econom progress induc overshoot   the next exhibit examin polici aim at alter the composit of the feder reserv balanc sheet   as is evid in the chart  the feder reserv alreadi particip in all segment of the treasuri market   as the focus of that particip has shift over the year  the averag matur of the system   s hold has vari sinc      from as short as about one year to as long as four year   step up our purchas of note and bond might be a way of lower risk premium on treasuri secur   simpli put  when a larg purchas shift it demand  relat price chang   lengthen the matur of the portfolio may also convey the sens that the feder reserv see littl likelihood that it would put polici on a tighter path than current expect   that   s becaus  if the polici rate turn out to be firmer than anticip  the valu of those longer term secur would declin   the committe might pursu such a polici relat indirect   say  by instruct the desk to tilt it purchas toward longer term issu   a more formal scheme might be to target both the overnight rate and the averag matur of the system open market account  the extrem exampl of a polici key to the composit of the balanc sheet would be to announc a ceil on a longer term yield below the prevail rate  signal both dissatisfact with current expect about polici and a willing to put our capit at risk if the committe  sn   t follow through by keep short rate low   the caveat to manipul the balanc sheet are numer   as to affect relat return  empir evid suggest that relat suppli do not matter much for risk premium  at least within the limit rang of variat in the u s  experi   moreov  purchas of secur might have to be massiv to enforc a ceil if investor came to doubt that rate would be kept low   at that point  you might have the concern that the secur would becom disconnect from the rest of the yield curv and from privat rate   as to underscor a commit to keep rate low  it is not obvious whi a central bank issu a fiat currenc should care about capit gain or loss   if that is the case  then shift the composit of the portfolio would not do much to reassur investor   such a polici would also have to be close coordin with the treasuri to ensur that debt manag chang do not simpli offset the effect that the committe desir on the composit of the stock of debt held by the public   anoth form of polici s ulus could possibl be put in place by expand the feder reserv   s balanc sheet even beyond the size requir to drive the fund rate to zero  the subject of exhibit     in general  a central bank eas monetari polici by expand the stock of reserv   these day  most central bank choos to calibr that eas by target the price of reserv   that is  the overnight feder fund rate in our case   the feder reserv could switch it focus from the price of reserv to the quantiti of reserv  or the growth of reserv     if it so desir  the committe could then set a reserv growth target design to drive the fund rate to zero and subsequ provid further monetari s ulus by oversuppli reserv at that zero rate   as relat in the box  over suppli reserv   some might call it quantit eas   could affect the economi by lower the return on the asset purchas to suppli those extra reserv  by convinc market particip that the overnight interest rate will be kept low in the futur  and by work though a quantit channel  if it exist   it is noteworthi  as detail in the memo the committe receiv on polici in the     s  that there were distinct busi cycl fluctuat that decad even as the overnight rate hug close to it zero bound  moreov  those chang in econom activ were preced by chang in the size of the feder reserv balanc sheet   the basic logic that more reserv have to do some good reli on the observ that boost reserv by enough ul  must lead to rise price   howev  as in the yellow warn box  a long run associ between the monetari base and price   not provid much guidanc about the short run perform of the economi  impli that it would be difficult to gaug polici effect and that it risk confus market particip   most import  the long run associ observ in the data is that a perman increas in the money stock is associ with a perman increas in the general price level   for oversuppli reserv to have an effect  the public has to be convinc that the increas in reserv will stick around as long as need  so there still will be a communic challeng that might includ a role for some form of commit   although i have spoken about these polici in relat abstract term  they are part of our histori  as shown in exhibit     the feder reserv has alway appreci the import of correct align market expect about the economi   in that regard  and as shown in the top left  one of the more sizabl reaction in financi market in the past few year to an fomc decis follow the decis on may   not to chang the overnight rate   the system has also been will to put it balanc sheet at risk to encourag appropri expect about interest rate or to calm fear about fund avail   as plot at the top right  the desk sold option on rps for the week around the centuri date chang that total near      trillion of notion valu   given that the desk alreadi oper in all segment of the treasuri market  we wouldn   t have to move up a learn curv if instruct to increas purchas of longer date issu   inde  from      to       the feder reserv enforc a ceil on the treasuri yield curv  the subject of anoth staff memo sent to you last week   as shown in the middl left panel  our hold of treasuri secur scale by net debt outstand did rise over that period  but that uptick was dwarf by the one that occur dure the inflationari excess of the late     s and earli     s   within that total and as shown at the right  by      the system own almost nine tenth of the outstand  relat small  stock of bill  suggest that at the short end  the ceil on the bill rate was a bind constraint   polici expect look over a longer period in the     s must have been more consist with the ceil on the long end of the yield curv  as our relat hold of note and bond fell over the decad   that episod also highlight a concern that you might have about an explicit ceil on yield   that of how to unwind such a program when it was no longer need   concern about the financi health of commerci bank that were heavili invest in long term secur that had their rate cap for near a decad led the treasuri to creat a bond convers program after the accord was sign in        as for polici gear toward quantiti not price  the feder reserv target nonborrow reserv from      to        that experi teach that the demand for reserv is suffici errat that such a procedur would be a blunt instrument   perhap appropri if the committe had alreadi driven or want to drive the feder fund rate to zero   this bring up the general issu of sequenc  which is address at the top of your final exhibit   the form of monetari s ulus that i have been speak about can be use onc the overnight rate has alreadi been driven to zero or as a way of drive the overnight rate to zero   altern  the committe might desir to keep the fund rate abov zero and reli on it abil to shape expect or alter the composit of the balanc sheet as mean of provid s ulus   in principl  for exampl  the desk could be given target for both the overnight rate and a longer matur yield   in such a scheme  monetari s ulus could take the form of gradual march out the matur structur to pull the yield on a slight longer term issu down toward   but not necessarili to   it zero bound   to enforc those target  though  if the committe want to keep short rate abov zero  the desk might have to add reserv in one segment of the treasuri market and to drain them out of anoth   i have focus on polici altern that reli on convent open market oper   perhap of larg scale or direct to a differ end than done current  there are other altern if the policymak believ that deflationari forc were sever   in particular  as outlin in the bottom panel  the feder reserv could reli more on the discount window by lower the primari credit rate or perhap by establish a special program to provid fund on concessionari term and for a matur longer than overnight    the committe could also instruct the desk to purchas a wider set of asset in open market oper  potenti includ foreign exchang to fo  currenc depreci   if the menu of permiss asset is view as too short to provid suffici s ulus  we could seek legisl to expand that author   presum to includ corpor debt and even equiti   there is anoth weapon in the board   s arsenal   it could cut reserv requir   true  the avail base is narrow  transact deposit  and the amount limit by law  at most from the current    percent to the   percent floor   but such an action would signal a willing of the feder reserv to use all mean at it dispos to reviv the economi   final  the feder reserv could coordin it polici with the administr and the congress to encourag  say  tax cut that would be direct financ by money creation   you can see whi i put this list last   these option would chang how we are view in financi market  involv credit judgment of a form we are not use to  perhap smack of desper  and pull us into a tighter relationship with other part of the govern   but they are avail if you felt the other  more tradit form of monetari s ulus would be inadequ to the situat   in general  the appropri sequenc of polici action depend on the cost associ with low overnight interest rate as compar with the benefit of addit macroeconom s ulus   complic matter  consider uncertainti surround the  e and magnitud of the effect of ani of these polici on the economi   the committe might also be concern that the public would take a switch in regim as evid that the econom situat had turn especi advers   at this point  i would be the first to admit that predict market psycholog in respons to an unpreced event is a lose game   it is also possibl that the public would come to the view that the feder reserv was    jump into the breach    with seldom use polici tactic and be reassur that policymak would go to ani length necessari to support satisfactori econom perform   the uncertainti attach to such action may well counsel take insur to avoid be put into the posit to have to reli upon them   but i suggest that that should be a subject for tomorrow   as for now  if the committe believ that such action may be requir  much work is need to be done in advanc
has outlin the strateg aspect to the conduct of monetari polici at veri low short term interest rate   i will be review some of the tactic issu the desk might confront in implement polici if the fund rate target either could not fall ani further or if the committe chose not to let it fall beyond a certain point   some of the approach that i   ll review would requir a chang in the composit of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet  wherea other would lead to an expans of the balanc sheet   the fed   s consolid balanc sheet is reproduc in my exhibit     the    domest financi portfolio    includ our outright hold of treasuri secur in the domest soma as well as temporari oper   both rps and revers rps   that are arrang in the market   i will restrict my remark to oper in asset and liabil in which the desk is current author to transact   in particular  i will be focus on the outright hold in our domest soma   some of the oper method i discuss  howev  would requir a chang in the domest author   a broad histor perspect on the size and distribut of our treasuri hold by matur bucket is present in exhibit    virtual all the increas in the total size of the soma has been a byproduct of the growth in currenc note outstand   the longstand concentr of our hold in bill and short term coupon secur reflect the import the committe has attach to have a relat liquid portfolio to meet unforeseen conting    the bottom panel in exhibit   demonstr how the composit of      the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     soma can chang and has chang over  e   in review the altern tactic approach the desk could adopt  i will also be distinguish between     oper method that are associ with the simultan pursuit of a posit feder fund rate target and     method in which this rate is allow to fall to it lowest attain level consist with lend risk and transact cost in the market   so i   ll start with a littl background on what target the fund rate impli for our domest financi portfolio   we keep the feder fund rate close to it target by provid a suppli of bank reserv   or    deposit of depositori     as it   s more accur label   on our balanc sheet  at a level consist with demand   this relat between the target level of the fund rate and the level of excess reserv is portray in exhibit    histor  the period averag level of excess reserv demand has been fair stabl within a narrow rang between    billion and    billion over a wide rang of target rate   when the level of excess reserv suppli over an entir mainten period deviat from demand  even by relat minor amount  it can caus veri sharp swing in the fund rate  although daili swing in excess level within a mainten period can be wide   in order to target the fund rate at ani posit level  the net size of our domest portfolio   soma hold plus rps less ani revers rps   must be adjust to provid a level of excess reserv that fall within a veri narrow band around this level of demand   the size of the portfolio is also determin by the level of bank    requir to hold reserv and by the level of autonom factor on the balanc sheet  most notabl our currenc liabil   the composit of our portfolio is not realli import for this purpos  so long as we have the necessari flexibl to offset volatil from day to day factor movement  the chart also convey our sens that just get the fund rate down to it lowest attain level would not requir a signific expans in the size of our portfolio  although the increas in the level of excess reserv might be larg on a relat basi  this would be true even if there were consider more elast in the relat between the fund target and excess reserv at veri low rate level     mention a possibl strategi of commit to maintain short term rate at low level for a long period of  e   such a strategi  by itself  would not requir ani chang to the desk   s oper approach for polici implement   we would continu to target the feder fund rate from day to day just as we do now  though some of the tactic approach i   ll discuss could be use to support such a strategi   the altern approach that would involv chang to how the desk oper are summar in exhibit     the altern that could be adopt while chang onli the composit of the balanc sheet are list in the top panel   these includ     extend the averag matur of the outright hold in the soma      set explicit ceil on longer term treasuri yield  and     use deriv instrument  becaus onli the composit of the balanc sheet chang  excess reserv can be kept at low level and under the desk   s control  allow the desk to continu target a posit fund rate   the bottom panel list a number of method that entail expand the size of the balanc sheet   most of these are just variat on the three approach i just mention   in one case they are combin with the use of revers rps and higher requir   these tool could be use to  il the impact of an expand portfolio on excess reserv  and thus still allow us to target the fund rate   altern  the impact on excess reserv could be left un il by choic  so long as the consequ of short term rate fall to zero were accept  final  there is the option of set an explicit quantit object for a high level of excess reserv   the top of exhibit   summar the issu that i will touch on when present these altern method   these includ the oper object that would be associ with each approach  which is not alway self evid   i will discuss the instrument and mean of market intervent  highlight where these differ from current practic   i   ll tri to identifi the circumst under which we could expect to be success in achiev our object   some approach may pose particular problem for arriv at a clean exit strategi  and other would requir a need to close coordin our oper with treasuri debt manag polici   final  some carri a greater potenti for realiz capit loss on our balanc sheet   approach that chang the composit of the portfolio but not it net size   the first option the committe might consid involv a chang to just the composit of the portfolio is to lengthen the averag matur of our outright hold  with no explicit object for yield   histor movement in the averag matur of the soma and of the public   s hold of treasuri secur are shown in the bottom portion of exhibit     the committe could  for exampl  instruct the desk to lengthen the averag matur of the portfolio  as one way for the desk to    move out the curv    and attempt to influenc longer term yield   or the committe could set more detail object for the distribut of our hold by specif matur bucket   either way  the object would be pursu use tradit oper techniqu   purchas could be preplan and arrang in an order fashion at a  e and of a size of our choos   we would like want to be veri open with the market about our object for the restructur of the portfolio rather than tri to gain some tactic advantag through the element of surpris in our purchas   exhibit   present a simpl exampl of how an object to extend the averag matur of the portfolio might be aggress pursu while still maintain control over of the size of the balanc sheet   in this exampl  which hold other autonom factor constant  we redeem      billion of our matur bill hold over a six month period   that   s about    billion per week   to make room for a similar amount of coupon purchas each week   these are distribut even over the three to ten year sector of the curv in this exampl   at the end of this period  the averag matur of the soma will have risen from forti two month to sixti four month  which would repres a signific increas abov our histor norm   our hold of secur in this matur rang would grow to about one third of the total outstand   howev  our hold of bill would drop to just under     billion  exhaust much of the liquid that exist in the domest soma  and leav us vulner to circumst that could call for a larg and quick reduct in the portfolio   the initi announc of a portfolio shift of this magnitud and the commenc of oper could have a profound  even tumultu  impact on trade and rate   recal that the announc by the treasuri to institut the buyback program in earli      and the plan to elimin the long bond in octob      had sizabl short term price effect   howev  after the dramat announc effect  it is unclear what effect either chang had in subsequ quarter and year  in fact  as   note  beyond the short term  empir evid   not provid much confid that this type of oper would have a signific sustain effect on relat premium   i   m hesit to put forward an es  for the yield effect in that sector of the curv where purchas in this exampl were concentr   but a rang around a    basi point declin   or perhap even as high as    basi point   seem consist with empir es   though again it is like that the immedi announc would generat more pronounc reaction   the reason for such modest es  is the observ high degre of substitut across matur   a larger and more durabl effect on yield probabl would requir a greater degre of segment in the treasuri market than exist   an oper object that entail shift the composit of our portfolio probabl stand a chanc of be success onli if the treasuri   s debt manag were neutral in term of the matur distribut of net new issuanc   certain  ani chang in the pattern of debt issuanc that take advantag of an incipi flatten in the yield curv induc by a concentr of desk purchas in longer matur could reduc the effect of such a strategi   the prospect of set explicit ceil on treasuri yield rais a host of issu  shown in exhibit    regard the design and coverag of the ceil themselv  the structur of open market oper to enforc them  and their possibl coordin with other tool as part of a broader polici strategi    as for the design featur  ceil  rather than peg  would make the most sens given the object  except possibl at the veri short end of the curv  where rate would be so close link to the target fund rate that the distinct might not matter   ceil could be set to cover either the entir yield curv or just discret portion   the initi ceil might remain fix over particular matur segment  or they could roll down the curv with  e so as to alway appli to the same specif issu   presum ceil would be announc   if not  market observ would soon come to recogn their exist and infer their level   convent outright purchas of treasuri secur would be the primari oper mechan to back up ceil   to maintain simultan control over the fund rate  purchas would need to be close coordin with ani redempt of secur  with our temporari oper  and with ani need outright sale   outright purchas might be arrang in one of two way  correspond to what one might refer to as    hard    ceil or    soft    ceil   these are meant to character our toler for deviat in rate from the ceil   a hard ceil would requir immedi purchas of whatev size was necessari  whenev rate drift abov their ceil   it would be a virtual stand facil if not a liter one  with a soft ceil  if rate drift higher  the desk would arrang a more limit quantiti of purchas each day  but it would be prepar to continu such purchas day after day for as long as necessari   this approach would permit closer coordin with  il oper need to target the fund rate   the tradeoff is to allow some deviat in yield from their ceil for a short period of  e in order to keep the fund rate close to it target   as yield drift up to the ceil  the desk would purchas treasuri   one import question about design is whether the desk would begin to sell and therebi lighten the soma   s inventori if and when yield fell beyond some defin threshold under the ceil   be symmetr in this way would prevent the soma from acquir success larger portion of treasuri debt    on the other hand  a success program of purchas and sale would  in effect  creat a yield corridor that would damp two way risk and potenti undermin market forc even more than just ceil would   perhap the most critic featur of ceil on longer term treasuri yield is how they would fit into a broader polici strategi   notwithstand the scale of adjust that could be made to our portfolio and the tactic finess the desk would bring to enforc oper  it is doubt that ceil could be enforc over  e if they were inconsist with market expect for the path of futur short term rate   success in enforc ceil that were not consist with these expect would hing on there be a high degre of market segment in the sector cover by ceil   by the same token  this segment might also suggest that success in hold down treasuri yield by forc of oper may not translat into equal success in bring down correspond privat sector rate   the need for coordin with treasuri debt manag would be even more crucial than if we were just extend the matur of the portfolio   and there is no clean exit strategi   the market would no doubt test our resolv to maintain the ceil   with each success    defens     the credibl of the ceil would increas  and the scale of carri trade would rise   iron  the like scale of this posit across all money market and fix incom class mean that we veri like could not hold back the specul pressur that would be unleash at the first hint that the ceil might be abandon   if the imposit of ceil were link to state intent about the futur path of polici rate  the need for support open market oper would be reduc and possibl even elimin  so long as the structur of ceil were close coordin with the commit  moreov  the exist of ceil might reinforc the credibl the market attach to ani polici commit   but it could be difficult to translat a commit on short term polici rate into a structur for ceil on longer term treasuri yield  could the announc of the ceil themselv  not link to ani clear commit  generat the kind of expect in the market necessari to ensur their own success  without the need for massiv desk intervent   an affirm answer would seem to requir one of two condit   either the market would have to read into the announc an unspoken commit or at least a strong expect within the committe about futur polici action on short term rate  or the market must be so in id by the desk   s perceiv firepow that it   not dare challeng rate ceil   the likelihood that either support mechan will endur for veri long is one i think unlik   the committe could sanction the use of various deriv instrument on convent desk oper as a way to influenc longer term yield  which is outlin in exhibit     option of some form are a possibl  as are forward oper   for exampl  we could sell a sequenc of option on term rps  cover interlock  e segment that collect extend as far into the futur as desir  in this way  longer term yield could be influenc and a visibl signal of the fed   s desir path of interest rate could be demonstr   forward oper in term rps could be structur in a similar fashion   altern  we could sell put option on longer term treasuri secur at strike price associ with desir longer term yield   of cours  the oper object set for the sale of deriv instrument would determin their proper structur and should be care formul first   i   ll come back to this subject after go through some of the logist issu   i   m also go to focus primarili on option for rps specif  as these have certain advantag over forward oper for the kind of polici purpos under consider   the sale of ani option  or forward for that matter  would not affect the domest portfolio immedi and  in the case of option  may never do so   auction deriv is someth we alreadi have experi do   in the event that option were ever exercis  the impact on the portfolio would be profound  assum that more than just a symbol amount of contract were sold   simultan control the fund rate mean that ani reserv effect would need to be immedi  il  the volum of option sold might be limit becaus of this concern   altern  option contract might be configur to make a net cash payout if exercis  perhap by structur them as interest rate caplet or pair them with offset trade with the desk at then current market price   this would insul the size and composit of the balanc sheet  but the payout would appear veri visibl as loss on the incom statement   of cours  a success program would be one in which ani option sold would never be exercis   achiev this result  just as with interest rate ceil  would depend on how well the characterist of the option   the strike price and the expir date   correspond to market expect for futur rate   in this regard  option on rps with the desk have a strong advantag over  say  option on treasuri yield becaus the polici rate over which the committe has direct influenc could be more direct link to shorter term rps than to longer term treasuri yield   for these same reason  option on desk rps could be structur to correspond direct with a polici commit on the path of futur short term rate  and they could be effect through one of sever channel   first  even a relat small program would undoubt add symbol weight   second  they would repres a monetari cost to the feder reserv of deviat from the impli path of futur short term rate  which might be seen as further bind the committe to that path   for this effect  the more option sold the better   third  a larg volum of option sold could reduc risk premium embed in longer term rate  independ of the level of credibl about ani polici commit   here too  the more sold the more effect   as with interest rate ceil  the question could be ask how effect the sale of option  either on desk rps or treasuri secur  would by itself be in reduc longer term yield   no doubt  an initi impact would be felt  but ul  success would hing on the quantiti of option sold   that is  how big a bet the feder reserv were will to make   the more option sold  the greater the chanc they would have the desir effect on longer term rate even if not associ with ani polici commit  either by rais the cost to the fed associ with option be exercis  or by lower risk premium on longer term rate   but of cours the risk to the portfolio  to reserv level  and of capit loss would rise in equal measur   and an exit strategi for option may not be as straightforward as it seem  even apart from the possibl of their be exercis   of cours  the desk could stop auction new option at ani  e   but a decis to stop sell more option or not to issu new contract with later expir date as  e pass like would be interpret in the market as a statement about futur polici intent   the result rush to unwind market posit would like be veri disrupt and send yield sharpli higher   approach that chang the size of the portfolio   let me now move on to approach that involv an expans of the balanc sheet   revers rps or higher reserv requir could be combin with ani of the option alreadi describ   extend the matur of the portfolio  set ceil  or use of deriv   to  il the effect on excess reserv of these altern approach   some of the issu surround use of these addit tool are present in exhibit     these might be seen as be prefer to redempt of bill or outright sale   use these tool would expand the scale upon which these altern approach could be pursu  perhap therebi improv the prospect for their success while still allow us to keep tight control over the level of excess reserv and to target a posit fund rate   howev  there are serious question as to whether use of either would be effect or even plausibl   larg scale use of revers rps would requir care structur of oper to ensur adequ particip  given our dealer counterparti    natur posit as borrow in financ market   a regular and predict auction cycl and use of term oper would probabl be need   even so  have to financ through dealer    balanc sheet could constrain our abil to secur the necessari level of fund without consider upward pressur on the rate dealer show to us   there is also some question as to whether the treasuri collater we would deliv back out on these revers rps would partial negat ani price effect of our origin purchas   there is ampl histor preced for adjust the level of reserv requir to absorb excess liquid in the market  in the current environ  howev  rais requir might be cost to bank becaus interest is not remuner  might prove ineffect becaus of sweep program  or might be undesir becaus of it effect on the volum of bank lend   exhibit    show the differ approach that would involv an expans in the level of excess reserv   object for extend the averag matur of the portfolio  rate ceil  or use of deriv could all be pursu when ani effect on excess reserv were left un il   the oper flexibl avail to pursu ani of these other object would be increas consider  just as with the use of revers rps or higher requir   of cours  the higher excess level associ with ani expans in the balanc sheet would quick push short term rate toward zero   in theori  short of meet one   s oper object or acquir the total avail suppli of treasuri debt in the process  there is no clear limit to the potenti growth in excess reserv   altern  set a quantit target for excess reserv far abov the level need to bring short rate to zero could be it own object   oper  this object probabl could be achiev with littl troubl  through an order purchas of treasuri secur in the secondari market   this object could also be easili pair with a secondari object for an extens in the averag matur of the portfolio or even some specif distribut for the soma   altern  a prefer might still be given to hold bill to preserv the liquid of the portfolio   the econom effect of replac treasuri debt in the hand of the public with higher excess level  and of zero short term rate in general  might not depend on whether there were an explicit target for higher excess level or whether high excess were a byproduct of other oper object   a quick exit strategi   the abil to resum implement monetari polici with a posit feder fund rate target   could be veri difficult to achiev oper in ani scenario in which excess had built up to sizabl proport   the more short term bill acquir to achiev the expans of the reserv base  the fa  excess could be brought back down relat quick and painless simpli by let matur bill roll off   a temporari expedi could be to rais the level of reserv requir  which rais the same issu discuss befor   i   ll conclud by make a few summari observ  which are outlin in exhibit      in term of our be abl to achiev the narrow oper object that might be set for us  there seem littl doubt that we could be success  with the possibl except of explicit ceil on longer term treasuri yield   but mani of these altern approach would have as an implicit intermedi object a reduct in longer term treasuri yield  and in the case of rate ceil  this would be the explicit oper target   while our abil to chang the composit and size of our domest portfolio measur in absolut term is undoubt huge  it is still question how sizabl and durabl an effect desk oper alon would have on relat market determin rate   as   note  howev  chang in market expect about futur short term polici rate can have a profound effect on longer term yield without ani adjust to the central bank   s balanc sheet   such chang could be induc by a communic strategi to shape interest rate expect   the tactic approach i have describ could veri effect reinforc some form of communic about the futur stanc of polici   for purpos of shape market expect about futur short term rate  howev  it is unlik that the adopt of ani of these altern oper approach by themselv would be an adequ substitut for some clear communic come from the committe   final  all the approach that i have describ rais issu about exit strategi  coordin with treasuri debt manag  and potenti for capit loss  some of which i have mention   but in general  it seem that concern associ with these issu would be greater if we were reli on chang in the composit and size of soma hold to be the primari channel through which we were tri to influenc longer term yield   thank you
at this point  the staff is seek guidanc from the committe on how to proceed   in particular  we will be listen especi intent to your discuss this afternoon for answer to the four question highlight in exhibit    the veri last chart in my packag   first  are there ani altern that the committe particular favor for addit studi   second  are there ani altern that should be drop immedi from consider   third  how   the committe assess the cost of veri low nomin overnight interest rate  and are they such that an altern polici should be put in place at a fund rate abov zero   final  how should the committe   s assess of these polici altern be convey to the public in the month ahead
let me just say first that  combin with the supplement memorandum you gentlemen have given us  you have cover the ground in an except comprehens way   we have to be care  though  not to tri to lock in ani particular strategi  larg becaus we don   t know how event will transpir under a number of differ scenario  if these becom the type of polici that we must implement  i think we   re go to find that we will have to do a signific amount of decisionmak as we go along   we cannot possibl identifi and develop plan to deal with all the potenti outcom of a situat and environ to which we have never been expos   if we tri to cover everyth  we like will find that we cover noth in suffici detail  i   m remind of the sever studi group that were set up prior to the      stock market crash to examin what would happen and what we would do in the event of a financi crisi such as a market crash   the member spent a good deal of  e think about that and look at potenti outcom and made all sort of suggest regard what the feder reserv should do   i do not deni that that was a veri use exercis to keep our mind function   but in the event  our respons was wholli differ   we did in fact  quit effect  put togeth an ongo program as event unfold  rapid respond to them with the experi we had in mani differ area   look back on that episod  i think the feder reserv did an except good job in coordin not onli with the treasuri  obvious  but also with the sec   we had a signific amount of contact with the various exchang   i don   t know if you rememb this  but more  e was spent on communic between washington and chicago than one could have even remot imagin beforehand becaus of the problem associ with the option exchang and a varieti of other problem that emerg in chicago   the reason i mention this is that the bodi of detail that has been adduc today is  in my judgment  primarili for the purpos of bring our educ up to a level that will enabl us in the event   and i trust it is a veri small probabl event   at least to understand the system suffici well to respond to the situat  i   d also like to note in close that there are a few veri interest issu in the supplement materi   i must say that as i was read mr  orphanid   s memorandum on the liquid trap   in which he demonstr  as most modern economist now conclud  that in ani meaning way there was no such thing as a liquid trap   some other thought came to mind  as i read through it  if i substitut    deflat    for    inflat    and the word    japan    for    the ghost of          i found i could replic mani of the discuss on the issu of deflat that have occur around this tabl at recent fomc meet  it is realli quit remark how our predecessor struggl dure the     s with the fear that inflat would emerg   as a consequ  they lean over backward to prevent inflat from occur and creat a signific econom retrench  especi in       that arguabl was unnecessari   i thought the parallel to the japanes situat were eeri  athanasio didn   t mention it in his paper  and it wasn   t relev to his analysi   but for all of us  i think  it serv as a warn that we have to be veri care about talk ourselv into the inevit of event that would lead to a potenti deflationari catastroph   if such event occur  we will move to fight deflat  and in my view our discuss today is veri help in prepar ourselv to do that success   but let   s keep in the back of our mind that histori is wave a few flag to make sure we reserv judgment as to how convinc we are that certain event will occur   so my general respons to the four question   ask is that i believ it   s prematur to answer ani of them   that   s my judgment   who would like to follow up   laughter
in lieu of follow up direct  i   d like to ask a question   the chairman mention the word    japan      prior to his remark  we heard two brief that last about forti five minut to an hour  and the issu of japan did not come up   i   d like to know  recogn that japan has sever problem with it bank system that we do not have in this countri  what mistak you think the japanes have made   they   ve execut some of these polici we   re talk about   perhap they start too late  perhap their communic wasn   t suffici clear and robust  or perhap they didn   t aggress stay with ani of the polici long enough   all of us around the tabl have thought about the situat in japan for a long period of  e   as you   ve review and examin it  what lesson do you think we need to learn from japan about the mistak that can be made in execut some of these nontradit polici
well       laughter   the staff  as you know  did a paper that receiv some attent in which we came to the conclus that the japanes start too late
that   s an easi answer to give after the fact  and i hope we convey in the paper the thought that as we wit that period in real  e we  too  did not perceiv that japan was slide into the difficult situat that subsequ develop   so  that   s meant to be a red flag   but it   s also meant not to trivial the problem of our inabl to see the futur with ani great clariti  relat to the kind of option that these gentlemen have put on the tabl today  i think there would be a lot of agreement that there was one thing the bank of japan did that was veri wrong   name  at each step along the way they portray the situat as abnorm and an emerg  and they indic that the action they were take made them uncomfort and that it was their intent to return to more normal oper absolut as soon as possibl   that certain character their first step in the direct of zero interest rate  and i think they   ve probabl learn from that mistak   one  sn   t hear japanes offici use that kind of languag ani longer   but in the earlier stage there was alway a tone that they grudg were go to do a littl more if they had to and were go to take it back just as soon as they could  admit  some of the thing that made them uncomfort are the veri problem that have been identifi here   and those are real problem   but i think the japanes limit the effect of their action by this overton they use to character the step they were take as they announc them
so it was a weak in the commit part of it
right  and a failur to perceiv the expect part of it   i think they were count on their statement to help a lot becaus of what otherwis isn   t avail to policymak at zero interest rate   i don   t think they realli embrac the concept of expect enough at the  e  even intellectu  in term of the import of get expect to work with the policymak instead of work against them
governor    if i could just add a comment   i think your first point is the one that i would have start with  name the problem in the financi system and the inabl to intermedi credit  which have shown up in so mani way   we are fortun that at least right now we don   t have those kind of problem in the unit state  so   and i did not have to delv into that issu in our present   it would certain complic matter if we were face a situat in which the bank system was have problem like the one that the japanes have had
yet they realli have onli one mean of financi intermedi  which is commerci bank   but we demonstr in       when our bank system froze up  that there were altern mean of intermedi  which carri us through and enabl the economi to recov until the bank system came back   they don   t have that option   they have a broken bank system  and they are deal with an economi without other essenti financi intermedi   we   re go to learn a good deal about how that economi function in the futur   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   have just heard you say that these aren   t necessarili option we want to talk about  i still would like to get a reaction from the staff about some of them   perhap for the sake of discuss   independ of what we may do tomorrow  we are at histor low interest rate  and peopl are wonder how the feder open market committe might conduct itself in the futur   given that situat  it give me paus to think about be ask a question and tell peopl that as one method we could target a rate out on the yield curv   i   d feel much more comfort say that we can expand reserv regardless  i   d feel more comfort do that than talk about target long term interest rate becaus  with our bank industri in good shape  the expans of reserv would caus some mechan to kick in that would tend to s ul the economi   how do you or other member of the committe feel with regard to our talk about these issu  given that the question will inevit be ask
do you mean in the event that we are forc to move to a point where we can no longer function use the feder fund rate   are you refer to what we say at that point  or are you talk about now
i   m talk about now  mr  chairman  depend on where we move the fund rate   peopl are say  even in these memo  that the effect zero rate is    basi point or that the money market fund would be affect if the fund rate get to    basi point or lower   therefor  question are go to aris as to how we should conduct polici or how we plan to conduct it
i would suggest   and this is jump the gun a bit on tomorrow   s convers   that if we move the fund rate down by    basi point tomorrow or if we make no chang  you don   t have to have that discuss
i don   t think anybodi is of the opinion that a feder fund rate of   percent will caus the money market mutual fund  for exampl  to dissolv into non exist   if we go    basi point  then the issu aris that anyth we do beyond that may have to involv so call nontradit oper techniqu and  inde  the question will come up   my own judgment is that  if we actual tri to target interest rate anywher along the curv  we would be court remark uncertainti   it was perhap possibl to do it back in the     s or      s or even in the      s when financi market and market particip didn   t have the degre of sophist they have today   also  the abil to get around rate ceil was much less than it is today  so my suggest is that  if you get ask those question  just say we are examin nontradit method and there are mani differ way in which we can address the issu   i would be as nonspecif as you know how to be   the general point that we can move out on the yield curv is  of cours  someth we need to say   in other word  we are not by statut or practic restrict to affect onli the overnight rate  which would obvious mean that  when that rate get to zero  we   re out of busi
but as for what that mean beyond that  i would be veri vagu   the major reason is that i don   t think we will know until we start to address the issu  as we do so  we   re go to learn far more about how the market are function than we can anticip   i have in mind that this would work in veri much the same way that the event of octob           render obsolet all the work paper that the group studi the risk in the u s  financi system had put togeth   we did have the foresight to say that we thought there was a possibl of a stock market crash  and we were abl to say that we had done advanc think about how we might react   but it didn   t do us much good
one thing you   re say that i appreci hear   becaus i would feel veri uncomfort talk about it   is to stay away from specif discuss about target rate out the yield curv   i want to endors that   i also understand the need for vagu  given that we can   t anticip what the futur will hold for us
yes  we have a whole set of tool that in principl could be use and should address this issu effect   we know in the abstract which combin of tool would be the best and how they would interact with the economi in a way that we would consid satisfactori   i don   t think we can know in advanc  howev  which combin of tool we actual would use  and i think it   s foolish to even suppos that we can   but to go through an abstract analysi can be a veri use exercis   for exampl  i thought the analysi in the supplement paper on the various potenti effect of move the fund rate down was instruct  incident  as for those potenti effect  the onli one i disagre with is the notion that  if the money market mutual fund start to dissolv and we get a switch from mutual fund hold to deposit in the commerci bank system  bank capit ratio will becom a problem   such a switch would inde build up both the liabil and the asset side of the balanc sheet  so statist it is obvious the case that the capit ratio would becom an issu  but econom that can   t be   here we have two type of institut that are financi intermediari   money market mutual fund with asset and liabil and littl capit and a commerci bank system   if the money market mutual fund are squeez out of busi  effect what you   re argu is that those two set of institut are consolid in a sens   to the extent  for exampl  that those who are borrow in the commerci paper market will be back in the bank market   the whole notion of mere consolid the two set of institut and then find that there must be a problem  if there wasn   t one befor  may make statist sens  but it  sn   t make econom sens  what that situat would suggest to me  if inde we get a veri major escal in bank deposit  is that the problem that may aris relat to what we should do with bank capit ratio becaus we   re deal with a huge industri   yet if all that occur  which is what one would think will occur  the asset side of the bank system will be load up with short term treasuri bill and other such asset or even commerci paper   in that situat  we might be inclin to think that we   re see capit defici in the bank system and that we have a crisi   that can   t make ani sens   that   s shoot ourselv in the foot   so if you   re ask for a specif recommend regard what we should do under those condit  the answer is this   we ought to re examin our process of determin capit adequaci in the context of consolid the two type of financi institut  with the full recognit that there cannot be increas financi risk on the basi of whether two intermediari are act by themselv or as a consolid institut   yet that   s what we would have statist   presid
i  too  was impress  in the context of athanasio   s paper and the paper on japan that   talk about  by the idea that in the period of deflat under review the monetari author had been focus on some differ object and not on avoid deflat   in the case of the     s  the concern was about inflat  and in the japanes situat  there was no understand of the need to move quick   obvious  the paper emphas that the japanes wait too long to act   it also emphas that in the japanes situat a better job of coordin could have been done in term of work togeth with the fiscal author to segu when it was appropri for monetari polici and when it was appropri for the treasuri to be involv  i agre that one can never forese the particular of a crisi situat befor it happen  but i   m wonder whether we   re at zero or close to zero interest rate becaus of a truli problemat deflat   not simpli a numer deflat but one that involv veri weak econom activ and the prospect for continu weak econom activ   given the feedback effect that occur with deflat  i wonder whether it wouldn   t serv us well to have two or three polici option that we   ve explor in some detail   i don   t think you mean to preclud that  mr  chairman   in my view it might help us to have a few potenti cours of action that we have investig thorough   i say that becaus what we   re realli worri about is not a situat that occur in a flash but one that build up and get wors over a period of  e   in at least the two period of deflat on which we have paper in front of us  the analysi suggest that such situat could be handl better if the monetari author made more effort to anticip the potenti deflationari develop and work against them  i agre that the materi in these paper that we   ve talk about today and that dino threw into the mix is complic   it feel as if we   re look at a huge multidimension matrix contain a lot of littl box and a number of potenti outcom  and it   s veri  veri hard to get one   s mind around all of it   but i   d be interest in look more extens at the two or three step that would seem most like to be necessari if we thought we actual were go to get into a downward spiral deflationari period   i realli don   t think we are   i have a high degre of op  that we will not  but i would like to take out a bit of intellectu insur  if you will   i   d like to know that there are one or two cours of action that we could proceed with and have some confid that we were do someth use if in fact the possibl of that corros deflationari spiral seem to be grow more than it is now  when i look at the analys that give us probabl of deflat  i   m not sure that i believ the number   i   m sure they   re mathemat accur  i   m confid of that   but i   m not sure the    percent probabl of deflat in       which is the figur shown in one or anoth of these paper  refer to the type of corros downward spiral that is our primari concern here   i would attach a lower probabl to such an outcom   but that kind of deflat  even if it   s a veri low probabl event  would have such enorm consequ for us and the world that i think we do need to have one or two tool at hand that we think we could use over the longer term  that said  i   m not sure which of these tool has the greatest potenti   there are some avenu i wouldn   t pursu   i wouldn   t go to the market and say we   re go to keep interest rate at x for so mani month or so mani year and we   re confid that we are go to do that  i person wouldn   t do that   but some level of commit and communic has to be a part of ani of the cours of action that have been mention   i   ll stop there sinc i   ve probabl said enough on a subject about which i know too littl
let me tri to link the discuss about our situat with the point that roger was rais about japan becaus i think the japanes experi   provid some import lesson   i don   t have the data in front of me  but in the earli      s the money stock actual fell in japan for sever year run   japan made the same mistak at that  e that we did in the earli     s  when the feder reserv and mani other thought that polici was becom easier becaus interest rate were go down but when  in fact  the central bank was pull liquid out of the system   certain one import lesson from both the earli      s in the unit state and elsewher and from the earli      s in japan is to pay some attent to the aggreg in these extrem circumst  second  anoth key featur of the japanes environ  although not so much in recent month  has been a veri import and bind exchang rate constraint   japan has never felt comfort pursu a polici to provid liquid that might have the consequ of allow the yen to depreci substanti against the dollar   i think that was wide understood in japanes societi  and there are probabl a lot of inform way in japan of ensur that their currenc   not depreci that are not so applic in our environ   but that   s a type of a price constraint  if you will  that prevent the japanes from go as far as they might otherwis have gone in pursu a quantit target  i think it   s veri import to realiz the veri basic point that we can   t fix both the price and the quantiti   if the price   the feder fund rate   get down to zero  in my view we realli don   t have ani choic but to concentr on the quantiti and to forc a lot of liquid into the system   in fact  there   s a rather interest symmetri in the situat   when the inflat rate is relat high  it also turn out that interest rate can give mislead indic becaus of the confus as to how much rate are be driven by chang in inflat expect   countri that have gotten into inflationari problem can have great difficulti run polici in term of interest rate  the central bank realli has to control the amount of liquid it is creat   interest rate  as i think we   ve learn through a lot of experi  work well as a polici instrument in the broad intermedi rang   but when a countri has an inflat problem or a deflat problem  the central bank had better pay a great deal of attent to the quantiti of money  as for the problem in the market as they relat to the viabil of money market mutual fund and so forth   if we have to choos  i don   t have ani doubt as to what i   d choos  and that would be to let the money market fund go   it would be inappropri to tri to save the money market fund and pursu a monetari polici that  sn   t fit the need of the aggreg economi  that  sn   t make ani sens at all   i think we need to say veri open that we   re not go to tri to save an institut or industri if that action produc or could potenti produc substanti damag to the economi as a whole
let me interrupt   i suggest that you say that around this tabl onli  unless you want to get veri promin headlin in the press   the size of these institut is veri larg  but you   re quit right in suggest that they are ephemer   we could expand and collaps what is essenti overnight short term intermedi almost at will   it is possibl to creat a multi hundr billion dollar money market mutual fund almost overnight and we can subsequ collaps it   but if we were to tri to communic to the public that we   re will to do that  the knowledg in the marketplac about what is involv is such that peopl would not understand it   and if you were to say it public  i   m certain that you   d get more press than you want
that some  happen  yes    laughter   but i think the danger of a veri quick collaps  if you want to use that term  is easi to overes    i believ there   s like to be a lot more continu in the process   first of all  we   d probabl find that there   s a rang of money market mutual fund with differ expens ratio  and it would not be too hard to imagin that some of the manag compani would absorb some of those cost for a while  other might institut fee for process check   so there would be continu   the bank have the same situat  of cours  with deposit account that in most case don   t have ani servic charg   the bank are go to need to start charg month servic fee to handl deposit account if rate remain veri low for a long period of  e  i thought that the staff discuss of the import of the exit strategi was extrem import   if we do someth  we   d better figur out how we   re go to get out of it and what the issu involv in that process are   that   s part of the problem with a polici that simpli say we   re go to peg the fund rate for some relat long period of  e or that we   re go to move out the term structur and hold the one year rate at zero or at    basi point or whatev  it   s veri hard to get out of that   the more we get into target longer term rate  the more direct respons we are for capit gain and loss that peopl realiz when we chang the rate that we peg   what we want in my view is for the market essenti to be respons for make those judgment and not the central bank  so it seem to me that the best way to go if we get into this situat   and i agre with cathi that it   s not like   is to focus on quantiti  make sure that we forc a lot of liquid into the system  and let rate go where they will   that will mean that the feder fund rate frequent will trade right down at zero   that   s a consequ  and if we   re not will to accept that consequ  then we   re not go to be abl to carri through on a polici that   s orient toward forc liquid into the system and target some quantiti   that   s where i come out  i believ it   s veri import befor we get too deepli into the institut detail to start with the veri simpl proposit that we can   t fix both the price and the quantiti   at some point we may have to choos

thank you  mr  chairman   i came out pretti much where you did with regard to the four question   so i   ll attenu my remark   but let me briefli explain whi  we   re have this convers  at least from my perspect  becaus of our concern about the possibl of deflat   if i ask myself whi i might be concern about deflat  exhibit   is one answer   the depress   while there may not be a consensus as to the caus of the great depress  peopl usual cite a crisi in bank  inappropri monetari polici  wage sticki and collus in the labor market  and mayb the smoot hawley act   none of those condit seem to be particular preval or relev today in my judgment   anoth answer  exhibit    is japan   there again peopl cite serious problem in the bank industri  stop and go polici  and serious resourc misalloc have to do with tri to preserv die or uncompetit industri  and so forth   again  as in the case of our own depress  those condit seem to be larg absent in our economi today  the third possibl reason i come up with for our concern today has to do with disappoint about the rate of growth in the economi   depend on what  e period one select  the economi has been grow at     to     or   percent over the last group of quarter  my suspicion is that  if it were grow at   or   percent or more  we wouldn   t be veri concern   even with price index go up at a rate of   percent or so  plus or minus   about the possibl of deflat   if that judgment is right  then what we   re realli concern about is the pace of econom growth   so what it seem we should be involv in  at least for the moment  is a fair tradit exercis of econom s ulus in an effort to further boost aggreg demand   that suggest to me that for now our primari focus should be on our increment polici chang  if ani
thank you  mr  chairman   i would agre with you that  if we were think about answer the four question in order to come up with a tactic plan  the exercis wouldn   t be veri product   but it seem to me  base upon the inform provid by   and his colleagu  that there   s a lot of inform that could prove to be use under certain futur circumst   that lead me to believ that it is worth studi some of the issu rais in these paper   for exampl  there was a question ask by   about altern instrument   i   d like to know a lot more about some of these altern   clear the use of the discount window and also longer term treasuri secur   one concept that i thought was extrem interest was the issu rais about chang expect   i think it would be veri interest to find out a littl more about the effect on expect of make clearer to the public our view on what rate of inflat we would find desir   those kind of studi are not in my view part of ani tactic plan that we might implement in the futur  but they may contribut to our understand of how we might want to react to certain event   i   ve tri to talk about the desir of make our view clearer on inflat rate without use the    t    word    laughter
thank you  bob
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with you that the present we   ve heard and the three background memo that were prepar for this discuss were all excel   i enjoy read the paper and i took a lot away from them   to    dino  and    i want to say that i think the memo you did with your colleagu realli flesh out the issu  i took away three main point from the background memo   first  for money market to adapt to veri low interest rate involv some cost  and those cost have a bear on how far we should push rate down befor we contempl other approach to deal with persist disinfl  if in fact we get someth like that   second  the evid from the     s present in athanasio   s excel memo i think clear suggest that we should not constru that evid as an indic that monetari polici is ineffect at the zero bound on nomin interest rate   third  in the     s we did succeed in enforc a     percent ceil on govern bond yield part by a commit to keep expect short rate veri low befor      and then with larg scale purchas of long bond thereaft   these were all interest point  and i enjoy read the memorandum  with respect to our strategi and tactic go forward   tri to appli some of the lesson from histori and even look beyond them   i recogn that we may be abl to address further disinfl by induc signific addit reduct in long term interest rate whether we explicit target them or not   that   s what most peopl seem to be think about as the next step   but i   d like to add a new dimens to this discuss becaus bond rate  like short rate  are also subject to a zero bound at some point  which ul  would put a limit on this polici channel if disinfl persist or deflat began to threaten us   so i   d like to talk about what i   ll refer to as the    what next    issu for a coupl of minut   that issu is  how should we think about further monetari s ulus if we get to the point where both long  and short term interest rate polici essenti have been immobil  now  i agre with a lot of other peopl   although i   m not sure how mani peopl around the tabl here   that the odd we will face this situat are small and may be exceed small  becaus of that  it   s tempt to conclud that we have plenti of  e and realli don   t need to think about this or discuss it yet   in other word  we   ll cross that bridg when we get to it   but i would argu that it   s not onli use but actual urgent that we think about these kind of option now   i   m build on the point you were make  cathi  becaus confront deflat just like confront inflat involv a credibl problem   that   s the essenc of it for me  moreov  unlik inflat  the credibl problem in deal with deflat is compound by the zero bound on nomin interest rate   that rais at least the possibl that interest rate polici alon can   t deter deflat even if we   re will to drive both short  and long term interest rate to zero  in the current situat   i m not go to talk about current polici but use that as a framework in this situat   if the fund rate were to get closer to zero  the possibl of deflat has the potenti to creat deflat expect and actual deflat simpli becaus peopl may doubt that we can and will use monetari polici to combat deflat effect at the zero bound   my concern is that wait to say or think about how we would deliv further monetari s ulus if rate were to fall to zero could in some circumst lead the public to conclud that we can   t do it   if peopl think we can   t deliv  that would risk creat a credibl deficit that could make it much more difficult to deal with this situat if in fact it aris and we tri to use differ type of polici to deal with it   so that   s whi i think it   s essenti that we begin to talk about this and consid it now   i   m not talk about develop a detail strategi but at least put someth on the tabl  so  what next   well  common sens tell us  and this has been point out alreadi  that at some point a determin expans of the monetari base has to be effect against deflat at the zero bound   if that were not the case  we could elimin all tax  and the govern could perman financ it oper with money creation alon   so the next step is that we use what are be refer to as quantit polici in this discuss   in principl  i think it can   t be deni that they would work   in practic  though  there are a lot of obstacl to creat credibl for these kind of polici   let me mention a few of them  in particular  the bang for the buck of quantit polici at the zero bound at this point is anybodi   s guess   it could be quit weak in practic   we just don   t know   so there is at least the possibl that we might have to expand our balanc sheet enorm   well beyond it normal steadi state size   to be effect   further  sinc short term govern secur are perfect substitut for the base at the zero bound  we probabl would have to accomplish ani such expans through purchas of longer term secur  first govern secur and then privat secur   but that  as has alreadi been mention  would requir us to have an exit strategi for drain larg quantiti of the monetari base onc the deflat has been broken   if in fact earlier we had to increas the base substanti   sinc we would be sell long term bond back to the public in volum at more normal   or   percent rate  after have purchas them at rate near zero  we could face a substanti capit loss   conceiv  in a realli unusu situat  we could have insuffici asset in our portfolio to bring the base back down   in that latter situat  we would presum have to have some arrang with the treasuri to recapit us with short term govern debt to allow us to complet the drain oper  let me quick recapitul the key point i   ve tri to make here   the first is that  until we work through this    what next    scenario and communic a credibl strategi  address it to the public at some point  i think our conting plan for confront deflat will be incomplet   in my view  that would be a serious omiss   we do a lot of conting plan at the fed  and i believ we should do some comprehens conting plan on this kind of scenario even if it probabl is low   and i would say the sooner the better   we don   t have a stash of credibl as deflat fighter yet   if we delay think about and develop a strategi for deal with further disinfl and it continu   and especi if it acceler   we could wind up with a sizabl credibl deficit   that could make it veri difficult for us to employ success ani strategi that we might be forc to come up with in this kind of situat   so i would just put that view on the tabl  too
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to congratul the author of these paper   i think they did some veri fine work  and i believ it has been extrem help for all of us who are tri to think through these veri difficult issu   i just have a few comment   i would at this point clear stay away from target interest rate at other than the short term fed fund rate that we now target   i would avoid target longer term interest rate for a lot of the reason that have been mention alreadi   of cours  that bring us to the quantiti side  which we   ve been talk about  of tri to inject reserv into the system   there is a lot about that that i don   t understand  and i would like to know more about it befor we ever have to go down that path  though i certain agre that it is a veri unlik possibl at this point   but i think we should have some sens as to how we would go about do it and how we would address some of the veri import issu that al broaddus rais  there is one question that immedi came to my mind in the cours of     s present  and i think dino talk about it  too   on page    of     s materi he talk about target the short term rate at   percent  say  but lower other rate   so we   d have to add reserv in one segment of the treasuri market and drain them out of the other   i was just wonder if we could do that without undermin the effect of what we were realli tri to accomplish  given the way that the arbitrag oper and peopl move along the curv  substitut asset all the  e   could we realli implement this without advers affect our object which  of cours  is to add liquid to the system
i think the short answer is that i have everi confid in dino   laughter  but he may have to do transact in veri larg size   one could imagin  for instanc  the committe call out a ceil on the five year note yield   one would hope that would be consist with the expect it was tri to engend through other statement   but also call out a   percentag point feder fund target   what that would mean is that dino would be buy five year note to enforc the ceil if expect call for that   that is  if price start fall and push the yield up to that ceil  he would inject a lot of reserv   he   d have to offset those reserv by do revers   in effect use the secur just bought as collater to pull reserv back out of the bank system
we wouldn   t be chang dramat what we do now in the sens that the oper target would still be the fed fund rate   we would still be target   in your exampl  let   s say  a   percent fed fund rate   and we   d have a secondari object of enforc a ceil  but at that point  as   say  we would be oper with both lever  so to speak   on the one hand  pull money in and  on the other  put money out   so it could get rather busi for spenc and his colleagu on the desk  who would be buy and sell at the same  e   in a sens it   s a lot like  il foreign exchang intervent in which the desk is offset with the right hand what the left hand is do   so there is a question about the effect of that and what it would mean for other  broader polici object
the other import concern you identifi  presid    is that the more two point on the yield curv had to be enforc by larg scale transact  the more like the target longer term secur would be disconnect from the rest of it neighbor on the yield curv and then from privat rate   that could happen if we wound up purchas the five year note  say  and do larg revers   i think the goal would be more to encourag expect consist with a low five year yield  which would be price into all asset   if we get involv in a corner solut where we own a lot of the five year note issu  it   s less like to be transmit to other market price
yes  we couldn   t target just the five year note   it would involv the six year and the four year note and so forth  it would have to be a smooth curv  i assum
i think that  in principl  we could set the price of ani point on the yield curv   there   d be obvious question about whi we   d want to do that if our goal was to affect privat rate   more like than not  the oper would involv  as was the case in the experi of      to       target all along the yield curv
thank you  mr  chairman   this discuss is go to be imposs for anybodi to make sens out of becaus we   re all throw our wisdom  or lack of it  out there  i will do likewis  and let somebodi els worri about where it goe  my first point is that i agre with you that the uncertainti about this are so imponder  as somebodi said about the iraq war  that i don   t see how we could ever hope to settl on a conting plan   i do think it is veri good disciplin for us to start think about this problem and talk about it and mayb reject some idea and some approach   so i think it   s a good discuss to have   but i don   t see how we could ever come up with a firm conting plan  i also tend to agre with bill pool about the money   interest rate issu   that while interest rate might be a use guid for polici when they   re in the middl rang  they are not veri use when they get to the extrem   obvious  the fund rate isn   t an appropri polici instrument when it start bump against the zero bound  and i think he   s also right that it probabl is not veri use when it   s on the high side   so in such circumst we might natur go to a more quantit target   my instinct  for reason i   ll discuss in a minut  would be to do that in a relat neutral way in term of the composit of our asset   but it   rais a question that i don   t feel i can make ani progress on  which is  if we start do more quantit target  how would we do it   that is  do we want       or   percent money growth  and over what  e period do we want that growth   for three month or six month  there are a lot of issu involv  and i don   t know how to sort through them  it strike me that target the rate structur is a lose game   six or seven peopl have spoken against that alreadi   if we want to focus our staff   s effort  i would propos that they spend less  e on that   i just don   t see how we could ever target the entir rate structur   staff  e would be better spent focus on what we might conceiv do  i would like to say a few thing about the issu address in exhibit   in     s paper  which is manag interest rate expect   one  it strike me that we ought not to do it so we can say     well  we should never tri to do that      i don   t see how we can avoid do it when we conduct monetari polici   so it might make sens to think about it a littl more serious   if we can do it at all  then i don   t think we have to get into the term structur issu becaus i believ that expect are go to domin anyth els we do in term of the composit of our purchas or anyth like that   if we do tri to shape interest rate expect  in my view pledg to hold short term rate at a certain level for x period of  e is again a lose game  there is no way we can see the futur well enough to make that kind of judgment   possibl we could say we will do it until y happen  in the way shown at the bottom of exhibit     but i would like to be in charg of defin y and not commit to hold short term rate at a particular level until some kind of numer standard is achiev   until we see gdp rise at  say    percent for two quarter or until inflat turn up  or whatev   i would like to do it until y happen  where we have defin y vagu in a way that we control   that is  until we see sign of some particular develop   i think we   d have to be quit vagu here  but one thing that give me some op  about this is that when it come to vagu i think this group is hard to beat   laughter
let me suggest that we break for coffe   the list of those who want to speak on this subject is veri long  so it is go to consum a larg part of today   s session   and i think for good purpos
we need coffe to get through it
we do   let   s keep the break to ten minut   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   let me tri to react to some of what i   ve heard today   i certain agre with you and the mani other who say that we don   t need to make decis or announc anyth immedi   among other thing  read the materi and listen to this discuss have chang my mind   so what i would have said a week ago differ from what i would say today   we   re all learn in this process  and i think the process need to go on  one lesson that i drew from japan was that not onli did the japanes get down to zero on the interest rate and not onli did they tri each new polici and say they were go to take it back  they didn   t give ani sens of where they were go   they were lurch from one polici to the next  each  e say that they didn   t think it would work   so i do believ it   s import that we decid befor we get to the point where such polici need to be trigger   and i   ll come to that issu next   at least on a veri rough sequenc of what we will do and how we will talk to the public about it   we don   t need to be veri specif  but befor we begin to use nontradit techniqu  i think we need to talk about them public and creat a sens of continu and confid in our policymak  which i believ was absent in japan  now  where   that sequenc need to begin   i certain was convinc from the materi we receiv that    basi point is not a floor for the feder fund rate   in my mind  part becaus i have some doubt about how efficaci some of these quantit eas polici would be  i certain would go all the way to zero on the fund rate or darn close to it  if necessari   i admit that such an approach would trigger adjust in market and institut that would be cost   but i think the benefit of go down to zero  if we need to  would probabl outweigh those cost   the fact that these institut have to adjust might argu for a more gradual approach than we might use otherwis to get the fund rate down effect to zero  but i don   t think it argu against do that  someth that   bother me  in term of the current percept of where we are as an institut in our think about this  are the newspap stori say that feder reserv offici  whoever those anonym peopl are  have said that    basi point is as low as we   ll go   i certain would like to take that notion off the tabl   i think the notion of    basi point as a floor is one of the thing that may be press us to move ahead fa  with our think than we   re comfort with   peopl seem to think that onc we get the fund rate to    basi point we   ll have to make an announc that we will target someth els   i don   t think that   s true
but that   s what peopl think   the truth is of secondari consequ at the moment
right   so if the other member of the committe are in rough agreement  i certain would like you to clarifi in your tes oni  mr  chairman   or in the question and answer period that follow   that we don   t view    point as the lowest we can go   i think that will give us some addit flexibl here  anoth problem in japan was that the author were over op ist about the economi   they kept say thing were get better  but they didn   t   to me that underlin the import of our public discuss of where we think the economi is go and what our polici intent are   like governor    i think we do this all the  e   talk about where we believ the pressur are come and what the polici respons will be is not someth new   we have done that in the past  especi when the economi and polici were in disequilibrium   one exampl is the         period when we said rate are low  we   re go to keep them low until we see the economi realli pick up  and then onc the economi pick up signific we   re go to rais rate to somewher close to the level of the natur rate   that was a pretti strong statement   anoth exampl is the           period when we said we   re go to keep rais rate until we see econom growth slow to potenti  so in my view this idea of a commit strategi is noth new for us   the question is whether we would need to modifi what we alreadi do as we move rate down to the zero bound  in that regard two issu come to mind   one is whether in that situat the committe ought to have a longer statement as a committe instead of use onli your congression tes oni or speech to explain where we expect the economi and our polici to be go   i think we saw follow may   that when the committe speak   and this actual was surpris to me   it statement has a littl more forc than when you speak  or at least reinforc what you have said befor in tes oni and elsewher   so  have the committe talk about it expect at a littl more length than we typic do might be help  the other issu is the one that governor   rais about how specif we should be   like him  i   m more dispos to be vagu rather than specif  it help with the flexibl  i   m convinc that numer forecast under those circumst would be fraught with difficulti and problem and would be bound to be wrong   on the other hand  i also recogn that  at the zero bound  the cost and benefit of perhap clarifi expect   if we think we can do that   might be differ than they are under the current circumst   so if it   look as if we   re get the fund rate down there   and i don   t expect that we will   that would be a  e to think about whether quantif of forecast and object would be help   i   m not sure it would be   i rather doubt it   but that   s an area we could studi if we got close to the zero bound  final  i have some doubt about the efficaci of quantit eas   i know there   s a long run relationship  and somehow one would think that the central bank ought to be abl to set the price level by print an appropri amount of money   but as al broaddus said  the problem is that the relationship between price and money growth might be a veri weak one   it might not hold over short or even intermedi period of  e   i wouldn   t reject quantit eas as a possibl if we got to that point  but it   s down on my list  and i would be care about convey a more confid attitud about the efficaci of that techniqu than i think we feel   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i find it use in think about monetari polici at the zero bound to view it as work in one of three broad way   first  it work by affect expect of futur short term interest rate  which affect longer term interest rate and other asset price   second  it work through mechan that depend on the imperfect substitut of differ asset   that would be  for exampl  the purchas of individu asset or the asset portfolio substitut effect that were describ by     third  it work through fiscal effect  which were not much emphas in the materi we   ve look at and are a form of last resort action  but which i think in the japanes case might be call for at this point  in my view the imperfect substitut effect and the quantit eas effect are there  but they are probabl weak and somewhat difficult to identifi at this point   as i said  the fiscal effect probabl fall into the last resort categori   so for those reason  at the stage we   re in now  i think we should be concentr more on the expect and commit effect look forward   besid the weak of the other two approach  i think the expect effect on the term structur  first of all  are best understood   there   s a paper i would recommend to you  if you haven   t read it  by eggertson and woodford that explor the expect effect of short term interest rate and their effect on long term rate in great detail   inde  that approach is more or less what we   re do now   of cours  monetari polici as normal practic work primarili by affect expect about longer term polici and  therefor  longer term interest rate  what i think has been miss from the discuss we have had here today so far is that work on expect of futur short term interest rate can be done through a comprehens packag   there are mani differ way to approach expect manag   one is communic of the type we   ve been do through our statement   there are various target procedur for inflat or price level target   eggertson and woodford talk about some reason for price level target  which is their favorit approach   there is also signal through various kind of market intervent of the kind dino has talk about   option  purchas of bond  discount window lend  and so on   in particular  to those of you who have argu against tri to    target    long term interest rate   if by that you mean that we specifi a target for the five year bond and then tri to enforc it by buy  five year bond   i must say that i agre with you     percent that that   s not go to work   but if the polici is one in which we essenti tri to lower the whole path of long term interest rate and we enforc that with a packag of complementari action that includ tri to manag expect along the term structur and take a seri of other action such as purchas long term bond and other kind of instrument  i think that   s one of the first thing we ought to be do   i believ that would actual work and would in fact be a good approach  so my answer to vinc   s four question are  in short  that i agre with bill pool and don kohn that short term nomin interest rate should be brought down quit low   i don   t have much sympathi or forbear necessarili for protect small segment of the financi market   i believ our first approach should be the continu of our current polici of work on the manag of expect   and then i think we should consid packag of polici that support each other to tri to manag expect in the market and therebi affect longer term interest rate   thank you
much has been said that i would have said also   as i was think about my comment  i consid just repeat the name of those who said what i had intend to say and let you fill in the blank   but that shorthand is a bit inadequ   let me first of all say    thank you    to the staff   this is in fact a use exercis and one that i think we all have learn from   i tend to agre with the chairman that this is a theoret exercis that broaden our understand of what is go on and the rang of issu that we have to address   but i believ  as presid  n said  that the real issu here is reignit growth  that   s a key point and a serious one   i would weigh in on the necess of move to an aggreg target at the zero bound   i agre with that and also with the view that  in such a situat  tri to peg interest rate is t i becaus of friction or segment consider  the point i realli would like to emphas  howev  involv the whole question of press coverag of money market fund and the concern that has been express here and elsewher in connect with them   as someon who has live in that world for a while  i must say that such concern may be warrant if we are at a zero interest rate but that money market fund can do quit nice at relat low interest rate   clear  money market fund do not need a    basi point spread to exist  though it may be one that they would like   there has been an ongo debat in the industri and in the court over appropri rate spread   but in truth  the industri has been function quit well on spread of    to    basi point and make money at it   the industri has a long histori of fee waiver by mani of it compani  which suggest that they would continu that practic as long as they could maintain their balanc  retain their custom  and surviv through what is seen as a transitori problem   so i would argu that this concern about the money market mutual fund industri  short of truli get to zero  is overplay in the press and is someth we should spend less  e on   we should spend more  e on some combin of presid  n   s and governor bernank   s concern  which involv get econom growth to appropri level so we can move away from a fund rate that is close to the floor   thank you
i  too  am go to echo some of the comment of other  but i have a coupl of point i   d like to make   one is that  while i   m not so worri about the money market fund  say  i am concern   put on my supervisori hat   that we   re tell everybodi to make sure they understand their credit exposur   at some point  interest rate could get so low that they don   t cover credit risk   anecdot i know of some bank that alreadi have put floor on float rate loan just to make sure that the rate on such loan don   t get too low   that   rais issu about what will happen in a veri low rate environ   i don   t know what the magic number is for the fund rate   if it   s    basi point or    basi point   but at some point there could be an impact on credit extens   lender might be will to continu lend for a short  e  but if they don   t see a takeout in the longer term where rate are come back up  there could be some reluct to lend becaus of question about cover credit risk  that   s especi the case if we encourag them  as we move forward  to do a better job at credit risk manag  for those reason and other  i am also concern that as we move lower on the fund rate   again  i don   t know what the magic number is   we won   t realli be abl to oper on interest rate becaus there won   t be that much further to go   so i would like to look more at some of the quantit option that are out there   i found interest some of the altern in these wonder paper   i learn so much read them   and part just academ i want to understand more about these issu   i   d like to know  for exampl  if there are limit on how much of a particular matur we should own   at what point   the size of our hold affect market liquid   or do we want to own all issu of a given matur so we realli can peg the rate   what is the framework in which we want to make that decis   i   d like to have an idea of how much of differ matur we would have to own to have an effect if we want to eas quantit   i have no idea on that  the other idea i found interest is sell put option on treasuri secur   cynic  this could be the salvat for everybodi who hedg mortgag secur with long treasuri  we may be the counterparti of choic   i would like to understand that becaus the option market is not veri deep and i   d like to see how deep it is   if we went that way  how much room would we realli have to inject a quantiti of liquid   or is the scope relat limit so that we   d have to build a market   so  i think it would be use to explor further some of these issu that deal with liquid and the option we have if we want to go the quantit rout  i also agre that we can do a lot in term of manag expect just by what we put in our releas and say in our public comment   that is someth i think this institut has alway done  so clear we can do that   but i am interest in understand more about the implic of eas by mean of quantit target
i   d just like to interject here that one thing we have not talk about  and obvious we will if we get closer to the zero bound  is privat credit instrument   what will happen to spread as rate get down to veri low level  and what   that impli about element of risk and stabil in the financi system and in a sens the whole global financi infrastructur that is well beyond our immedi concern   in some respect i would almost prefer to know more about that than some of the issu that we have been discuss today if  inde  our princip concern is reignit econom growth   i say that becaus the posit from which we start will involv a whole seri of spread and impli risk  which probabl will be a veri import factor in the acceler pattern spark by our action   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me first start with the context  and here i agre with gari  n and other that the context of all this   as i think you   ve just indic   is reignit econom growth   we   ll talk more about that tomorrow  but we shouldn   t lose track of the point that presid  n rais   name  that if the economi were grow at a   percent rate and inflat were as low as it is  we   d have a veri differ view of the world  now let me talk about the issu that are on the tabl here  and in do so  i   d like to divid my comment into two section   one is what to do and when   the second is what to say and when   i   m go to start with the latter  what to say and when   in that regard i think that  first  we should recogn that we alreadi have a great deal of credibl   the fact that on may   we did noth with respect to interest rate but had a phenomen impact on the yield curv should give us some sens of empower  if you will  for those who are worri about reaction to what we say   but go further down the path of what to say and when  i would argu two thing   one is that we should continu to do what we   re alreadi do   in some sens maintain the status quo   and be veri clear about our intent to avoid this problem of deflat   two  without overcommit or be veri specif about it  we should convey to the public that we have a rang of tool that we could use   so i would say that at this stage we ought to keep do what we   re alreadi do  i   d be a littl cautious about the approach shown in exhibit     use either x or y   for the reason that ned   laid out   i think the probabl is quit low that we can forese clear what we might confront and therebi have a strong sens of when   base on a  e period or some extern event happen   we would move rate back up   so i would think that the kind of ambigu that we are so practic at would continu to be help   in that regard i endors what ned has alreadi said   so on the issu of what to say and when  my view is that  although we may not communic perfect  by and larg we have gotten ourselv increment into a fair good place and our credibl is relat high   i   m not sure even if we get to veri low rate that we   d want to chang dramat the way we communic  on the question of what to do and when to do it  let me start with the    when      i agre with the comment that    basi point certain is not the point at which we should begin to do anyth differ   i   m not sure if it   s    or     it may actual be zero   i think we need to have a better understand of that  if possibl   i am a littl concern about potenti discontinu if sudden we get rate down and then we begin use some other approach   i believ one of the earlier paper on the zero bound issu suggest that there should be some interplay between the level of rate and tri someth differ   so perhap we should not wait for zero and then make a chang   that is my instinct anyway  now let me move to the harder question of what that differ approach should be   i was veri influenc by the natur of the present we had from   and dino in that what we   re realli look at in all of these relat unconvent matter is some sort of risk   benefit tradeoff   as i listen to the discuss  i becam more concern about the risk of target particular segment of the yield curv  tri if you will to put a ceil on longer term interest rate in a veri explicit way   the exit strategi issu and the coordin with the treasuri strike me as veri real concern and not someth we should underplay   i am less concern  frank  about the possibl that we may take some loss or those kind of issu becaus i don   t see whi a central bank in an environ of fiat money should have a veri serious concern about that  so that inclin me  while not to a decis conclus  toward a pure quantit approach and a focus on reserv for a coupl of reason   one is that in some sens we have oper quit success that way both in the emerg of septemb ll and more broad  it is someth that central bank certain know how to do  and we can communic reserv target veri clear   i accept the fact that the interact between pure quantit eas and the outcom with respect to the real economi are potenti uncertain  but that tie back to the need to communic clear  so i conclud  as governor bernank did  that what we realli are think about here is a packag of quantit oper and communic   though my comment have been divid into what to say and what to do  the realiti is that they work in tandem   therefor  i believ we ought to be think about use both of those tool simultan   i   d compar it to the way one fli an airplan by worri about the altitud and the other thing that one worri about in the plane  which obvious i don   t know  so i wish i hadn   t gone down that path   laughter   let me close by say     i think we   re not in danger yet      it is import to have this kind of discuss  and     i   d keep all of our tool regard both what to say and do and when on the tabl   but i would lean toward avoid some of the riskier strategi by look more close at the reserv requir issu and think about quantit eas in a veri explicit way   thank you
let me mention a coupl of other point of view   as i read the materi   especi the matrix of the various effect in the marketplac   it struck me for the first  e that  while we are still in the process of think through what we might need to do and when  a lot of strateg decis have alreadi been made by those in the marketplac   presid santomero and other of you refer to the money market mutual fund   governor bie initi a look at money market mutual fund  and the respons that came back indic that a lot of strateg decis have alreadi been made  essenti for self preserv  on how to manag in a low interest rate environ   i   ve look recent at the bank industri in light of the first quarter result  and dramat chang are take place in bank balanc sheet and incom statement as a result of the low interest rate environ   it seem to me that the risk at the moment may be more liquid and interest rate risk than asset qualiti risk   asset qualiti has improv  but the interest rate margin declin    basi point from the fourth quarter to the first quarter   moreov  there is an explos on the liabil side in short term deposit while the onli growth opportun at the moment is in mortgag product   there seem to be a lot more room for refinanc  which mean the possibl of addit compress   so i think we are go to continu to hear from bank about the pressur that they   re face in a low interest rate environ  i   m remind  howev  that in the earli      s  if somebodi had told me as a banker that six month or eight month out my increment cost of fund was go to be    percent  i would have said     i can   t make it   the bank will fail      well  the bank didn   t fail   we found way to manag through  which bring me back to the fundament point   ul  the health of the bank industri will reflect the health of the economi   we need to be cogniz of the impact of a low interest environ  but our focus need to be on the overal long term health of the economi
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to thank the staff   i thought the paper and the present were excel  and they did add to my knowledg on these issu   i just want to make a coupl of brief comment on manag expect   i don   t make it a point to go around talk about deflat  but increas i   m ask about it   also  more and more often i   m be ask what tool the feder reserv has if we do reach the zero bound   what ammunit do we have left   again  it   s becaus so much has been written in the press about these issu   so i believ  as other have said today  that it is import to manag expect by communic effect   we need to say confid that the possibl of deflat is remot  that it   s the job of the central bank to make sure that we don   t have deflat  and that the central bank has a varieti of tool avail to address this issu   i  too  as sever of my colleagu have suggest  would focus on provid reserv to the system becaus that   s the tool that we have readili avail
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have comment  not much is left to be said   i   d start by observ  though  that have put the subject of deflat squar on the tabl as part of our statement after the last meet  i think we creat an enorm  compel need to do a lot of learn and to do it quick   the paper and the discuss today certain have help me understand the issu  mayb even more import   to pick up on what sandi just said   we   ve creat enorm interest extern among the press  our own director  busi peopl  and even my brother    laughter   everybodi i talk to want to learn more about the subject   in fact  the rang of emot reaction to our statement last  e among the peopl i talk with ran the gamut from those who were reassur by the fact that we are talk about the subject and understand it to those who found the mention of deflat frighten   the latter includ one of my brother who said     jack  you   re scare peopl      so i think our statement last month has creat for us a tremend respons to continu to educ the public about this issu and about what we   re do   it   s the number one subject for the speech request that i   m get these day  the other thing i was go to touch on  and this probabl has been talk about enough  is our basic respons as a central bank in a develop depress situat   to be sure that there   s plenti of liquid and to steel the intermediari to fund real econom activ   i don   t think anybodi has suggest that there is a lack of liquid now or that intermedi is not current take place  i don   t want to talk more about the japanes situat or the experi of the     s  they have been discuss   but i came to the meet wonder if those who were most concern about deflat in the short run would argu that more liquid at some point   and mayb veri soon   would help reduc the risk of deflat to a more accept level   there has been a lot of talk about that   i had troubl  too  tri to be respons to     s particular question and i felt better after hear your comment on them  mr  chairman   when i look at the option present  i felt the same way that i did when we had the discuss not so long ago about what we would do in term of conduct monetari polici if we ran out of govern debt   i never was complet comfort with ani of the altern we had on the tabl  i certain feel that way about this situat  final  i would emphas   and it   s been said sever  e alreadi   that we have to be veri  veri care about what we say on this subject extern   i fear that we could get ahead of ourselv and creat a self fulfil concern about deflat   i think i   m repeat point that have alreadi been made  so i will close   thank you
i have a veri brief comment about manag expect   first of all  we don   t want expect that are form now at our urg to be falsifi by event   that   s not good for anybodi   i view that as extrem import  and i think that   s in part what ned was talk about   we need to be vagu regard the thing about which we can   t be confid   we don   t want to make statement that we realli can   t be confid about   in particular  there may be even an inher contradict in our expect for interest rate and our expect for econom growth  for exampl   we think that expect that short term rate will be low for some  e to come will bring down long rate and fo  a reviv of the economi   but if we have a vigor econom reviv  rate can   t stay as low as they are current   so there   s some inher contradict there  and i think we have to be veri care about how we discuss that  when we talk about manag expect  it   s go to be veri help to be quit explicit in our think   we need to ask    expect about what      and we ought to think about whether those expect are consist with how we want the market to form it expect
i don   t have a lot to add obvious  but i didn   t want to be the onli one not to say anyth    laughter   i had my hand up earlier hope to follow michael     s discuss of the new oper twist  and i was go to suggest that we could call it the chubbi checker monetari twist    laughter   the other day i got an e mail from the head of the greater dalla chamber of commerc  and she ask if i would come and talk to a group of ceo about    monetari polici in a zero bound environ      i thought that was a strang request   it turn out that one of my director had plant that littl seed with her   he wasn   t there when i arriv at the meet  so the group did give me permiss to talk about a broader rang of issu than that   monetari polici in a zero bound environ was a topic on our agenda for our board meet two month ago  and our director got so interest in it that they ask us to cancel the program plan for our last meet and updat the earlier present  now we have a stand request to touch on that subject at everi meet   to report on what is new with regard to the outlook and how thing are go   so  this is a hot topic with our board  i was go to ask you a question that has been touch on by governor bie and olson  you mention that  in the greater scheme of thing  you thought that the money market mutual fund were expend   i   ve been surpris to see the resist among the banker on my board to continu reduct in interest rate   about the middl of       we start get resist to further eas move  primarili from our banker   i was a littl shock at their inabl  appar  to lower their cost as fast as their incom was go down
as the rate have gone down  earn have gone up   much to their surpris
well  they   re dead set against ani further eas now becaus they keep expect it to go the other way   i   m not sure what to make of that
i think the answer is veri simpl   if you are an institut that is do well within the paramet under which you   re use to function  you will fight ani chang without ani notion as to whether that chang is good or bad   that   s becaus there   s a veri larg uncertainti premium associ with the chang
it   s like the banker who was retir after forti year and said he   d seen a lot of chang and he had been    agin it all       laughter
that   s a good way to end   let me mention a coupl of general point that i   d like to add to this discuss   one is that i don   t think we know enough about how the privat financi system work under these condit   it   s realli quit import to make a judgment as to whether  in fact  yield spread off riskless instrument   which is what we have essenti been talk about   are independ of the level of the riskless rate themselv   the answer  i   m certain  is that they are not independ   but how their depend function and how those spread behav in earlier period is someth i think we   ll need to know more about   the reason is that i don   t believ  as i said befor  that we can construct an effect preemption strategi   well  we can construct a strategi  but i   m fear that it would not be veri use  what is use  as has been discuss  is to build up our general knowledg so that when we are confront with the need to respond with a twenti minut lead  e   which may be all the  e we will have   we have enough background understand to enabl us to make inform decis   we need to know how the system tend to work to be abl to make the necessari judgment without ask one of our skill technic practition to go off and run three correl between x  y  and z   so i think the notion of build up our knowledg general as a basi for function effect is except import   inde  the actual amount of  e we use in implement monetari polici   asid from the  e that dino and his colleagu have to spend at the desk   is realli veri small   we have a huge amount of  e to do other thing   what we have been tend to do   and i think quit import   is to tri to understand how these various market work   even if we never have to use the knowledg for the purpos of fight deflat  i will bet that we will find it use for other purpos  there is a veri interest question that i don   t know the answer to   and i suspect no one around the tabl     yet it   s crucial   in the quantit eas paradigm there is the general presumpt   and it   s implicit in everyth we talk about   that the relationship between money and price is in the long run veri close   the presumpt is that if you increas the suppli of money indefinit  the price level has to go up  no matter what  or we all should turn our econom degre back in to the univers that gave them to us   but what we don   t know and what unfortun we assum  i think more subconsci than anyth els  is whether the pattern of go from increas suppli to increas price level is a continuum   we tend to believ that there is  in calculus term  no discontinu in the structur   i submit we don   t know that that is true   inde  i   ve alway been concern about the fact that the japanes are pump in  pump in  and pump in money   they   re go to increas their monetari base inordin   the price level is go to stop move down  then it   s go to start up  and then it   s go to explod  and the discontinu there is a veri danger phenomenon   we know the size of their debt  the suppli of their instrument  and what their monetari system is do  there is no credibl long term possibl that a central bank can keep creat money  in mani case high power money  and the price level will continu to fall   that just is not credibl  but we are assum that we can turn it around in a smooth and not discontinu way and calibr the chang in such a manner as to transmut a system of disinfl into one of moder inflat   i hope that is true   i know we say that around this tabl without explicit identifi it   i don   t know anybodi who has prove it  and i suspect we will not know whether it   s true until we see an actual occurr of this phenomenon   so  i just want to throw that on the tabl   if anybodi on the staff has great insight into this  i   d love to see a memorandum on it  in ani event  i do think we would learn a great deal simpli by do some further studi on privat sector yield even if the knowledg never has to be use   a number of the issu that have been discuss around the tabl are valuabl piec of insight for a central bank   i would say that they are valuabl piec of insight wholli independ of the issu of whether we   re fight deflat  tri to creat chang in expect  or the like   so what i would suggest as the next step is that we ask our present to take a look at the transcript of this particular segment of our session today  tri to cull through it  and then make recommend as to what the respons to the four question was
wouldn   t it be easier just to solv this problem    laughter
anyon have anyth els that they wish to communic on this particular subject
mr  chairman  the depress era deflat end quit smooth  inflat was minus   percent in      and plus   percent in        so there   s one exampl

question for dino
i was struck  when you were talk about the spread for invest grade credit  that you mention the search for yield and expect regard rate but you didn   t say anyth about under fundament   what can you tell us about market percept in the debt market   you said someth about the equiti market  but i wonder how investor perceiv the actual risk involv in the purchas of fix incom corpor debt
that   s a good point   there is a percept that corpor creditworthi is improv   some of the issuanc is be use to refin debt   to delev for one thing   which  again  is better for the credit holder   but also liquid is improv as matur are be restructur   now  in a sens the downsid  as peopl have point out  is that corpor are not use as much money for invest as they might have   and  as the delev take place  the amount of net new issuanc is not actual as larg as the gross issuanc number impli   so there are peopl get money back from repay of debt  and there is competit for the avail suppli
governor    some of this will be address in the chart show tomorrow morn  and there are also a number of indic in part   of the  book about corpor credit qualiti   just to underscor what dino said  forward look measur of expect year ahead default  for instanc   a kmv type measur   have come off in the last coupl month   actual recoveri rate are do a bit better  and so are default rate  and though the rate chang are still toward the downgrad side  the margin has narrow
further question for dino   if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the domest open market transact sinc the may meet

thank you  mr  chairman   earlier this morn we receiv new data on order and shipment of durabl good  and we   ve distribut a singl page chart that i   ll refer to in a moment as i review those data   i should also note at the outset that this singl page chart replac one of the panel on page   of your chart show packag  which was produc befor we had the data   the top line figur in this morn   s data releas show that new order for total durabl good edg down     percent in may   as you know  within this aggreg we focus on the seri for nondefens capit good exclud aircraft to get a read on busi equip spend   order for this group of good declin about    percent in may  and shipment were off a tad more   although these number sound weak  they were actual a littl better than we had expect and would caus us to nudg up our forecast for equip and softwar purchas in the current quarter   in addit  as you can see from the chart we hand out  order  the solid line  have move abov the level of shipment  the dash line   provid some support for the moder near term increas in capit good outlay that we have assum for this project   turn to your regular packag of chart  the data i just review plus the stronger defens spend that we report last friday lift our es  of real gdp growth this quarter to    percent at an annual rate from the     percent figur shown on line   of the tabl   we are project a mark step up from this pace dure the second half of the year  larg on the basi of the polici s ulus   both monetari and fiscal   now in train   this acceler continu into       when we expect real gdp to advanc more than   percent   as you can see by compar line   and    the first half of this year turn out to be weaker than we had expect in januari  and we now project a sharper acceler go forward   we anticip that much of this pickup initi will take the form of stronger household expenditur   as shown on line    the growth contribut from consum outlay is project to start move up next quarter  as lower withhold rate and rebat check begin show through to spend   with household demand firm  the caution that has pervad the busi sector should gradual reced  boost outlay on equip and

materi use by mr  olin  ms   son  and mr    are append to the transcript  appendix     sizabl declin in march and april  and we are look for a modest rise in june  this outlook is consist with the

vehicl bounc back in may  as indic in the lower left panel  and appear on track to post a moder gain for the quarter as a whole   as shown by the barbel in the lower right panel  the automak    forecast of light motor vehicl sale in june are center near the sale pace of recent month   although these data are still too mix to conclud that activ is firm  we believ that the foundat is in place for a substanti pickup  as discuss in your next chart   an import part of that foundat is a heavi dose of fiscal s ulus  includ the newli enact tax law   as note in the top panel  we had anticip mani provis of the new law  includ the pull forward of cut in margin tax rate  marriag penalti relief  and the boost in the child tax credit   but the law also contain provis we hadn   t anticip in the april  book   notabl  the dividend and capit gain tax cut  an increas in the partial expens allow for equip invest  and some grant to state govern   moreov  the person tax reduct are occur sooner than we had expect   take account of the new tax law plus the continu effect of earlier tax cut and the larg increas in defens spend  we es  that fiscal impetus at the feder level  shown by the black line in the middl left panel  will be veri larg this year and next   inde  the cumul amount of s ulus now in train well exceed that provid by the tax cut and the defens buildup dure the reagan administr   onli a small part of this s ulus is expect to be offset by restraint at the state and local level  shown by the red line   financi condit are also conduct to growth   and have becom more so sinc the last forecast round   given the ralli in stock and bond market  we have revis up our assum path for the wilshir       the middl right panel  about    percent   we have also taken on board the substanti declin in a wide array of long term interest rate  includ the mortgag rate display in the bottom left panel   as shown to the right  we have incorpor the further depreci of the dollar sinc the last  book   your next chart take a look at financi condit in the household sector   on the whole  we think household are in good financi shape  though there are pocket of stress   as shown in the top left panel  the household bankruptci rate has continu to rise  no doubt boost by the still soft condit in the labor market   howev  the bankruptci rate focus on the worst tail of the distribut and   not tell us much about typic household   broader measur of loan perform have been send a more posit signal   as shown by the red line in the panel to the right  the delinqu rate on all household

over the past decad   household have been restructur the liabil side of their balanc sheet through anoth wave of mortgag refinanc   as shown by the red line in the middl left panel  the    coupon gap     which measur the differ between current mortgag rate and the averag rate on the stock of exist loan  is current veri wide  provid a strong impetus to refinanc activ   we es  that    refi    volum  the black line  hit yet anoth record this month  with household extract a sizabl amount of cash through these transact   even though mortgag debt has been grow rapid  the household debt servic burden  shown to the right  has been edg down in recent quarter  owe to the declin in interest rate and the lengthen of loan matur   go forward  we expect debt burden to lighten further  as incom growth pick up and as household continu to refin higher cost debt   turn to the asset side of the household balanc sheet  some observ have continu to rais concern about the emerg of a hous price bubbl   the lower panel show that hous price  as measur by the repeat sale index for exist home  inde have been grow rapid in real term   while we would not entir dismiss concern about a bubbl  we believ the price increas in recent year larg reflect solid fundament   most notabl  the sharp reduct in mortgag interest rate   the rate of hous price appreci has taper off from it peak in       and look ahead  we expect the gain to slow quit a bit further  howev  outright declin appear unlik under our forecast of abov trend econom growth and onli small increas in mortgag rate   as shown in the top left panel of your next chart  busi also have been take advantag of the drop in long term interest rate to improv their balanc sheet   the corpor sector has been reli heavili on bond financ  the red bar  while pay down bank loan and commerci paper  the hollow bar    this substitut toward longer matur debt is now in it third year  and the cumul effect can be seen in the panel to the right   the red line plot the aggreg ratio of current debt to asset for nonfinanci corpor  where current debt consist of short term oblig plus the portion of long term debt due within one year   as you can see  this ratio has fallen to the lowest level in more than a decad  even though the ratio of total debt to asset  the black line  has not chang much on net in recent year   the combin of lower interest rate and the shift toward longer matur debt has reduc the debt servic oblig for corpor  as indic in the middl panel   we have defin this oblig as interest expens plus debt due within one year  express as a percent of after tax cash flow   the debt servic oblig for the median invest grade firm  the black line  has now revers it entir run up between      and        for the median specul grade firm  the red line   the declin has been less pronounc but this seri still has fallen to the lower part of it histor rang   these trend are obvious good news about corpor financi posit   at the same  e  mani compani are have to cover fund shortfal in their defin benefit pension plan   as note in the bottom left panel  pension contribut by s p     firm tripl in       reach     billion   although this is a sizabl figur  we doubt that the pension situat pose a major threat to the health of the corpor sector   for one thing  the fund gap is high concentr among invest grade firm  which account for rough    percent of all contribut last year   moreov  even for these firm  last year   s pension contribut amount to onli a small part of their total cash flow   about   percent by our calcul   overal  we believ that corpor financi posit have improv a fair bit  and financi market evid agre   as shown by the red line to the right  the spread between the yield on ten year bbb rate bond and compar matur treasuri has drop sharpli from it peak record last fall  in addit  as shown by the black line  a market base measur of expect default over the come year has move lower as well   against this backdrop of stronger financi condit  a key element of our project is the outlook for busi invest  address in your next chart   as i note earlier  the data on nondefens capit good through may paint a mild encourag pictur about the demand for busi equip   in contrast  as the top right panel show  nonresidenti construct activ remain quit sluggish through april  our latest read   to gather more  e inform about the invest outlook  we ask the reserv bank to queri their busi contact on this topic   as note in the middl panel  about    percent of the respond plan to increas their capit spend over the next six to twelv month  somewhat outweigh the    percent that intend to reduc spend  the rest plan to leav their outlay about unchang   these respons seem rough consist with our forecast of a moder uptrend in nomin invest spend in come quarter   among the firm plan to boost their spend  about two third said that they had alreadi start to place the order to achiev this increas   we also ask about the major factor drive the report plan   few respond mention the cost or avail of extern financ  and an equal small fraction cite the partial expens provis as a reason to increas spend over the relat short horizon on

your first intern chart present an overview of develop in select intern financi market   as can be seen in the top left panel  both the narrow index of the foreign exchang valu of the dollar in term of the currenc of the major foreign industri countri  in black  and the broad index that also includ the currenc of our other import trade partner  in red  have fallen further and at a fa  rate sinc the januari chart show than dure the six preced month   on balanc  the index for major currenc has fallen   percent sinc the end of januari this year and near    percent from it peak valu at the end of januari        as can be seen in the panel on the right  the dollar has depreci particular sharpli in term of the euro  move down about    percent from it recent peak in januari of last year   the dollar has fallen signific against both the canadian dollar and the yen as well  with the stepdown against the yen come dure the first half of       the yen   dollar rate has fluctuat narrowli and chang littl on balanc sinc then   the depreci of the dollar has been broad consist with chang in correspond long term interest differenti  shown in the middl left panel  although dollar rate are abov yen rate  they are below rate in germani and canada   sinc the januari chart show  ten year govern bond yield have decreas in these market  but u s  dollar rate have drop more than german and japanes rate   borrow cost have diminish for emerg market economi as well in recent week   embi  spread for argentina and brazil  shown on the right  have fallen to level not record sinc the spring of last year   appar increas market willing to invest in riskier asset and to seek return as yield have fallen in the industri countri part account for the declin in spread   the absenc of ani major unfavor develop within these emerg market economi like contribut as well   as can be seen in the bottom panel  stock price are general up in recent week in the foreign industri countri  on the left   and major emerg market economi  on the right    but sinc the januari chart show  stock price in continent europ and japan are up somewhat less than the s p       your next chart report the result of our effort to use the staff   s econometr model of the unit state and the rest of the world to address the question     what have been the effect of the dollar depreci to date      clear our answer depend on the properti of our particular model   but even for a given model  there is no singl answer to that question becaus  in order to design the exercis for the model  the analyst must give a reason whi  in the counterfactu scenario  the dollar would not depreci as it had in fact done in real  e   for our first counterfactu scenario  we posit that each bilater dollar exchang rate in the model remain at it valu in the first quarter of       when the dollar on averag peak   we also held short term monetari polici interest rate constant at their valu in      q  becaus the exchang rate is import affect by monetari polici and we want to begin with no exchang rate effect come from chang in polici rate   this scenario treat the constant path of exchang rate as result from shock to risk premium term in the equat that relat exchang rate to long term interest differenti and the counterfactu short term interest rate   as can be seen in the top left panel of the chart  the effect of the dollar depreci sinc earli last year as structur in our simul has been to increas import price inflat  the bar  abov what it otherwis would have been by an amount that rise to more than   percentag point for the first half of this year and then diminish somewhat   such an increas in import price is larg enough to make a differ for pce inflat  the black line    the staff   s frb global model calcul that the increas in pce inflat owe to the dollar as model in this case rise to    percentag point in the second half of this year   as can be seen in the right panel  the weaker dollar is also a net s ulus for real gdp growth   in this scenario  that s ulus is calcul to have been neglig in      but to have ad about    percentag point to real gdp growth in the first half of this year and is project to add   percentag point in the second half   other model might not es  effect quit this larg   the answer provid by the first scenario reflect the impos condit that short term interest rate remain unchang   in general  monetari offici could be expect to respond to the consequ of strong exchang rate pressur  accord  the middl row of panel provid a second set of es  in which we retain the shock to the exchang rate risk premium calcul in the first case but allow the model to adjust monetari polici both here and abroad in respons to these develop and their effect on output and price accord to taylor rule  as a consequ  both interest rate and exchang rate do not remain unchang at their      q  level   this counterfactu allow for some feedback on exchang rate from the monetari polici respons to the pressur on the dollar and it consequ  when monetari polici is allow to respond  the calcul implic for u s  import price  consum price  and real gdp growth of the dollar depreci sinc earli last year are damp   in this es   the effect on import price inflat rise onli to around    percentag point  so pce inflat is boost onli   percentag point   the es  s ulus to real gdp growth is reduc to less than   percentag point in the second half of this year   as is evid from the rang defin by these two es   there is no singl answer to this question   but we see this rang as a reason bound for the extent to which dollar depreci to date has rais u s  inflat   and so counter deflat   and help to support real output growth   the effect on other countri are report in the bottom panel as    fix    for unchang polici rate and    taylor    for polici rate govern by taylor rule   the euro area experi a substanti reduct in price inflat and gdp growth even in the case in which monetari polici react to the exchang rate pressur  suggest that the appreci of the euro is import in explain current euro area sluggish   by contrast  the effect are much smaller on the other industri countri   the currenc of develop asia were fair stabl against the dollar over the past six quarter  so they too have experienc depreci on a weight averag basi sinc      q    thus our model es  that they have experienc higher inflat and stronger output growth as a result of currenc depreci to date   your next chart present some evid on the stanc of monetari polici that is current in place in two of the major foreign industri economi   the euro area and canada   the top panel show our calcul for each of these region of the output gap current impli by our baselin forecast   for the euro area  on the left   the gap will widen over the forecast period  as growth remain below potenti until near the end of the forecast period   in contrast  we project that actual output will remain slight abov potenti in canada over the same period   this project assum anoth eas of    basi point by the ecb by year   s end and no chang in the canadian polici rate   the middl left panel compar the actual path of the ecb   s polici rate  the black line  with the expect for that rate that we incorpor into the  book at the  e of your chart show one year ago  the red line  and to the market   s expect at that  e  the dash blue line    sinc mid       the ecb has implement a somewhat easier polici than we and the market were expect a year ago  as econom perform has been disappoint   the bottom panel compar the ecb   s polici rate to two variant of a taylor rule prescript   the first  the red line label    taylor rule #      util impos coeffici that equal weight deviat of inflat and growth   by that standard  the ecb has been a bit more expansionari than the taylor rule indic  as the rule impli continu effort to move inflat below the   percent target   the standard taylor rule can be critic as incorpor insuffici forward look inform   the recent declin in oil price and the appreci of the euro can be expect to lower inflat in the euro area over come quarter   in the spirit of includ these factor into the assess of the current polici stanc  we calcul    taylor rule #      the dot blue line  retain the same coeffici but substitut for observ inflat the staff forecast for inflat six quarter ahead  by that standard  ecb polici has been and continu to be tighter than the rule would prescrib  even given the recent cut of    basi point   similar comparison are present for the bank of canada polici rate on the right  a year ago  we and the market were expect the bank of canada to tighten by more than in fact has been the case to date   although canadian econom growth has remain abov potenti  the slow of the u s  economi and the appreci of the canadian dollar stay the hand of the bank in rais rate   compar with taylor rule calcul  in the bottom right panel  the canadian appear to have been somewhat expansionari   the move up in rule #  reflect the rise in headlin inflat  which in turn owe import to oil price   on balanc  the success of the bank of canada in keep that economi close to potenti suggest that they have adjust polici suffici in respons to econom develop over the past year   for the ecb  the pictur is more cloud   sinc      q   the ecb has lower rate a total of     basi point   we cannot replic for certain with our model exact what the shock have been that have struck that economi sinc earli        but our attempt to quantifi the effect of the exchang rate chang over that interv suggest that the ecb would need to lower rate signific more  perhap as much as a total of     basi point  to offset the contractionari effect on euro area gdp of the exchang rate chang they have experienc   our outlook this  e for the u s  extern sector is summar on the next chart   total foreign real gdp growth  line   in the top left panel  is project to grow at an annual rate of about     percent dure the second half of the year   a substanti acceler of real gdp from the first half   next year  we look for growth abroad to rise further   among the industri countri  activ is like to remain lacklust in japan and improv onli gradual in the euro area  wherea canada should continu to outperform the other foreign industri countri   growth in develop asia  the right panel  is project to rebound over the second half of this year  but to a lesser extent than we previous thought  as incom data have surpris us on the low side   we are also expect a pickup in expans in latin america  with mexican real growth recov in line with u s  growth   our forecast for the real exchang valu of the dollar in term of all of our trade partner  the middl left panel  reflect the downward shift in the market valu of the dollar that has occur sinc your januari chart show   we still see like factor that will put upward pressur on the dollar   as the u s  recov

balanc over  e  we have put into the forecast a veri gradual downward trend in the dollar  reflect the inevit need for extern adjust to occur some day   the implic for real export and import of a lower path for the dollar  a slight stronger outlook for the u s  economi  and a somewhat weaker foreign outlook  especi in the near term  are shown to the right   export  in red  are project to rebound and to make a signific posit contribut to gdp growth through        import  in blue  should expand some dure the rest of this year and then acceler strong  result in a negat contribut of more

chart     your next chart  shift the focus back to domest consider and outlin the major factor condit our outlook for inflat  as shown in the top left panel  we expect that a signific  though narrow  margin of slack will persist over the forecast period   enough to take a coupl of tenth off core inflat both this year and next   although consum energi price  the top right panel  have begun to soften  for the year as a whole we still expect them to contribut about a tenth to core pce inflat   next year  we expect them to be a neutral influenc   likewis  we expect core non oil import price  the middl left panel  to add about a tenth to core inflat this year and to have no net influenc next year  all in all  as shown by the red line in the middl right panel and on line   in the tabl at the bottom of the page  we believ that core pce price inflat is in the process of step down fair notic this year  and we expect it to edg down further next year   as can be seen by compar line   and   in the tabl  we have revis down our forecast for core pce price inflat both this year and next by about     percentag point sinc the januari  book   the deceler in core consum price over the past year  togeth with the likelihood that an appreci amount of econom slack will persist for sever more quarter  has   as you know   generat intens interest in and specul about the possibl that the u s  economi will begin to experi deflat   the next two chart touch on some aspect of the report on this topic that i wrote with doug elmendorf and dave reifschneid and that was distribut to you earlier this month   the first of these chart summar and updat our effort to assess the probabl of deflat and relat event   as note in the top panel  we comput these probabl use stochast simul of frb us  the board staff   s larg scale econometr model of the u s  economi   for the purpos of these simul  and consist with the analysi in the rest of the paper  we defin    deflat    as occur whenev the q  q  chang in the core pce price index is less than the es  measur bias in that index     percent   import  our definit is meant to encompass a much broader rang of circumst than mani observ have in mind when they describ deflat as inevit generat a downward spiral in econom activ   also in the realm of definit  we treat the zero bound as have been hit whenev the annual averag of the fund rate is less than    basi point   we assum that monetari polici follow a version of the taylor rule  but with the zero bound enforc   we drew the shock for the simul from the model   s residu over the period             in the paper we circul to you earlier  we took the april  book forecast as defin the baselin  but the result we show here take the june  book as defin the baselin   howev  you will note if you refer back to the origin paper that the differ attribut to this chang are small   the middl panel use frb us to calcul confid interv around the staff   s baselin inflat forecast   in particular  the darkest region give the    percent confid region  the intermedi shade show the extent of the    percent confid region  and the lightest shade show the    percent confid region   thus  for exampl  in the fourth quarter of       rough half of the probabl mass is es  to fall between zero and   percent   put slight differ  about    percent of the outcom show the measur rate of chang in core pce price over the four quarter of      fall below zero  thus correspond to true deflat of    percent or more  and anoth    percent show the measur rate of chang come in abov   percent   the bottom left panel report the probabl of some specif event   as shown on the first row of the tabl  take the june  book project as the baselin  we put the probabl of deflat at about    percent for this year  just short of    percent for       and about    percent for        as shown on the second row  we es  that the risk of hit the zero bound is lower becaus  in mani of the stochast simul  deflat is induc by favor product shock   as shown on the third row  the probabl of both experienc deflat and hit the zero bound is smaller still  but nonetheless repres about a   in   event for      and a   in   outcom for        the bottom right panel provid a model base perspect on one element of the potenti cost of deflat   accord to frb us  a number of aspect of macroeconom perform deterior when a central bank pursu a veri low averag rate of inflat  the one we have highlight here is that the central bank   s abil to stabil real activ is somewhat impair   as shown on the first row  at an averag cpi inflat rate of   percent  the right hand column   the central bank is abl to limit the standard deviat of the unemploy rate to     percentag point   but at an averag cpi inflat rate of zero   correspond to bias adjust deflat of near   percent per year   the es  standard deviat of the unemploy rate is     percentag point   similar  as shown in the second row  deep recess are somewhat more frequent when the averag inflat rate is veri low  accord to the model   while these effect are modest  they nonetheless suggest that your choic of an averag inflat object is a matter of some consequ for the perform of the macroeconomi   your next chart pose a seri of question about the conduct of monetari polici rais by this analysi   first  there is the question as to whether you should aim to put an addit cushion between zero and the long run averag inflat rate beyond ani allow you might make to take account of measur bias   the asymmetr natur of the zero lower bound and the downward rigid of nomin wage might inclin you toward the view that you should but would leav open the question of how larg the addit cushion should be   as note in the left hand column  you might lean toward a larger cushion the more concern you are about the advers effect of the zero bound and nomin wage rigid  you might also build in a larger cushion the greater you see the under volatil of the economi as be  on the other hand  as shown in the right hand column  you might be inclin toward a smaller cushion the greater your confid in the efficaci of the altern approach to the conduct of monetari polici that were discuss ye day afternoon   you might be so inclin as well if you are concern about the effici loss even from low posit inflat   for exampl  from the impair of the effect of the price system  the greater scope for loss from nomin illus  and so forth   a second question has to do with how aggress you should be in move to head off ani incipi deflationari pressur   as shown on the left  a first motiv for aggress and preemptiv cut in the feder fund rate might aris from concern that nontradit polici action will not be effect   a second motiv could center on second moment consider  thus  while you might think that nontradit approach would be effect  you might be concern about the uncertainti surround ani es  of the effect of nontradit monetari polici   under a convent analysi of policymak under uncertainti  that lack of assur would justifi move aggress to reduc the odd of your be put in that unfamiliar circumst   on the other hand  as note on the right  a less aggress approach would be warrant the more you are concern that market would interpret an eas in that circumst as signal a downbeat assess of the state of the economi or if you believ that the public would becom unnerv if and when they see that you have no more scope for tradit action   final  a third question has to do with whether your best cours would be to counteract a deflat alreadi in process even if real activ is current at a satisfactori level   you could be justifi in combat deflat in these circumst if you were concern about the effici cost of deflat  just as you have been concern about the effici cost of inflat   the cost impos by nomin illus  partial index of the tax system  impair of the price system  and heighten uncertainti about the futur cours of the macroeconomi would be reason for move to counteract deflat   in addit  you might be concern that deflat   even in this relat gentl form   could limit your abil to move polici aggress to counteract a deterior in real activ should one emerg down the road   on the other hand  as indic to the right  you might take a veri cautious approach in address the deflat if you believ that the factor give rise to it would prove onli temporari   a cautious approach might also be warrant if you believ that the deflat would ul  prove self correct  as it might  for exampl  if it was induc by a favor shock to product growth that so s ul aggreg demand as to lay the groundwork for an eventu acceler of price   your final chart display your project for      and        as shown in the top panel  the central tendenc for the growth of real gdp is   percentag point lower than at the  e of the januari meet  and the central tendenc project for the unemploy rate is   percentag point higher   the project for pce price inflat is unrevis   as shown in the bottom panel  you anticip a pickup in the growth of real gdp next year  littl chang in the inflat rate  and a somewhat lower unemploy rate by the end of the year   we would now be pleas to take ani question you may have
could you just repeat the statement you made with respect to corpor fund of pension fund   did you say that  for invest grade firm    percent of cash flow was contribut to pension fund   is that what you said
in        that   s right
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a question about the  book baselin and also about the altern simul   first  after read the text in the  book  it seem somewhat surpris to me that you had the real growth number for the second half of this year as low as they are   i   d be interest in what the result might have been had you allow the model just to run   that   s one question   second  as alway  the altern are veri interest and certain cover a veri wide rang of potenti experi   but i   m rather amaz   i think that   s the right word   that the lowest rate of growth for      under ani of the altern is about    percent   if i went through this exercis  mayb i   d have a similar problem   but i would say that  if one use a var model that is affect veri much by what has happen to the economi in the last three quarter  it would be pretti easi to get number that are a lot lower than these   i just wonder whether you think real growth rate of    percent and abov realli are where one would expect the reason altern to lie
let me address first the question of what we did to our forecast for the second half of the year   we mark it up by less than one might have done simpli on the basi of take on board the chang in condit factor such as fiscal polici and financi condit   we did that  i think  on the basi of two main consider   first  in the current climat of busi caution that we see  it seem plausibl to us that there would be a smaller reaction   especi by busi but also perhap by consum   than one might expect in ordinari macroeconom  e to the addit fiscal s ulus that has been put in the pipelin  second  we think that part of the addit demand in the second half will be met out of inventori as busi will be reluct to step up product until they becom more assur of the solid of the econom expans  i   m not quit sure how to answer the question about what would have happen if we had just let the model run  given that our model is thirti or forti judgment analyst    laughter   if we had toss the question to frb us  i think we might have gotten someth on the order of anoth    percentag point or so of growth in the second half of the year   in part  i think that is spoken to in one of the altern simul where we show a weaker yet respons to the fiscal s ulus  which result in    percentag point or so less real growth than in the baselin   as to how reason it is to show a set of altern simul almost all of which have growth rate with a lead digit of
even the second half result of     percent growth with the    weaker respons to fiscal polici    altern is impress
i agre with you that it   s impress   anoth impress featur of the current situat is the amount of s ulus that is in the pipelin from various sourc   they were enumer by     an unpreced amount of feder fiscal s ulus  a signific depreci in the dollar  a    percent rebound in the stock market from it low  and a veri mark reduct in long term interest rate   with all that  it certain look to us as if the odd are veri heavili tilt toward a signific acceler in econom growth   i do think there are risk to the downsid  but there are even risk to the upsid of our quit robust baselin project
okay  thank you
obvious  we can alway weav togeth a seri of veri plausibl outcom   for exampl  let   s say we start with weaker product growth than we are current forecast   if that were to come as a substanti disappoint to financi market particip  one could imagin that  as we push out yet again the diminish of this unusu restraint on invest spend until the middl of next year  we   d have the resourc util gap remain   suppos the gap did not diminish at all over the forecast period   i think the combin of those develop and mayb a littl less impetus to spend from the fiscal polici that has been enact could quit easili get the gdp growth forecast into a rang of someth that start with a   and not a     we certain did not intend the altern scenario to suggest that it would be unreason to imagin a forecast that was run in the     to   percent rang next year  i think that would be quit reason     indic his confid interv on the inflat side  the confid interv on the real gdp side are quit wide  too  as you know  and a forecast as low as you were suggest would fit within them quit comfort
pick up on presid parri   s comment and look at the central tendenc of the fomc project shown in chart     we more sage and conserv peopl also are predict someth abov   percent for real gdp next year and about   percent inflat  which histor is a high unlik configur   in a speech a few month ago i suggest that a relat easi way to improv the transpar of the fomc would be to detach these project from the chairman   s tes oni and releas them in a more  e way  perhap with the minut of the previous meet   it occur to me that the number that we see here would be quit use to releas to the public in two sens   one  this combin of unusu high growth and low inflat would make veri clear on what we base our balanc risk for growth go forward combin with our downward risk to inflat   second  i think it would support the financi market configur that we   re look for  which is a strong stock market and a strong bond market   so i think these fomc member project  which are somewhat more mute but nevertheless quit strong  would be quit support of our object  i   m wonder  is it on the tabl that we might let those be releas a tad earlier
this is an issu on which i think we realli ought to come to a conclus   we   ve procrastin on it   the problem that occur is that if we wait until my tes oni to releas these forecast  they are usual obsolesc by then  and i find myself struggl to reconcil those old forecast with the latest data   i don   t know what to suggest at this stage   you   re rais an import question  but i don   t think we have the  e to discuss it at this point   dave  do you have a suggest on this
well  obvious you want to think through the full implic of this   with an earlier releas of the fomc central tendenc forecast  one difficulti you might face in your tes oni would be that  with the ad three week of data  peopl will be ask you to provid an updat on it   you may or may not be in a posit to do that   but other than that  i   m not sure that i see ani substanti downsid risk
well  i alway have the obvious answer to the problem you mention   i can say that i have not spoken to more than a fraction of my nineteen colleagu on the fomc sinc our meet  and i can arrang for that to be the case    laughter
it probabl would be a wise thing to do
we   re go to have to make a judgment on this issu   an obvious altern is to put this inform in the announc today  which i would frank recommend against larg becaus these number don   t seem to squar exact with what we   re say in the statement  though technic they do   these are fair larg number and veri benevol one if i may say so   the troubl is that they   re alway benevol   i don   t recal in recent histori a project come from the committe that was as negat as suggest by the discuss that we tend to have around the tabl   in fact  i would say that if somebodi actual sat down and tri to squar the individu presid    remark with what is submit in these forecast  there would be some disson   i haven   t done it  but i   ve been around long enough to be awar of that phenomenon   if you want to find out  after each one of you discuss what is go on in your region economi  announc the number you submit   nevertheless  i think we do have to address the issu   it shouldn   t be today   but when would be the appropri  e to releas our fomc forecast is an interest question   one possibl is to attach them to the minut for the may meet when we releas them   is it thursday
on thursday  yes  mr  chairman   i put a cover memo on the materi on communic polici that we circul ye day ask for the committe   s guidanc as to when it would be appropri to discuss general issu about transpar   whether it should be at a lunch  at a one day meet  or not until januari   this is one topic that i can put on the agenda whenev you   d like
yes  i would think so   i assum nobodi would object to that   we probabl can   t resolv this issu prior to my upcom tes oni  but we ought to discuss what we want our polici posit to be on it   it shouldn   t be decid ad hoc larg becaus i think it   s a more import issu than we may have realiz in the past
just on this point  mr  chairman   i agre that it should be done in the context of a larger discuss of transpar becaus there may be some other thing we want to announc at the same  e   also on this particular point  you do give the reserv bank presid and board member a chanc to chang their forecast after hear the discuss at the fomc meet
right you are
so we   d have to chang that polici  too
yes  and i don   t think we want to chang that polici  that   s a good point  and i had forgotten about that
just one other intervent   we   re ask to do our individu forecast in the context of what we consid to be the appropri monetari polici  and we might not all have the same conclus about what that is
no  that has alway been a problem  and we   ve scrupul avoid resolv that question
i found chart        implic for monetari polici     veri help in tri to think through some of the issu we will get to later in the meet   in the middl panel there  you make the point that one argument for be more aggress would be a concern that nontradit approach would not be effect   on the other hand  suppos one were confid that such approach would be effect and had a sens that the public share at least some of that confid   could it not also be said that have that confid would support be more aggress becaus we wouldn   t be afraid of get close to the zero bound and the possibl that we might have to use those approach   could you make that argument
i may not have understood your question  but in general on this chart one could take everyth in column a and say it opposit would appli in column b   so inde  the greater one   s certainti about the effect of nontradit approach  the more complac one could be in take preemptiv action against a forecast of deflat
i had a quick question about the survey on capit spend plan  obvious  capit spend is the key to the forecast for the near term futur   i was wonder if we had ever done this type of survey befor   if so  what level of confid do we have in it  and has it help us in the past to predict futur actual spend by busi firm
in januari we also had a set of special question on capit spend plan   i think what might have been a littl differ this  e around   and other can correct me if i   m wrong   is that we tri to structur the question to get quantit respons that we could tabul as oppos to a more qualit sens of what respond    view were   but yes  we   ve done someth like this befor
so we haven   t done it quantit befor   i   m just wonder about the percentag you cite   that    percent are go to increas spend and    percent plan to reduc spend   you also said that two third of those who plan to increas spend indic that they actual have start to place the order   our district went the other way on that  which is rather interest
i   d have to say that we have no track record to assess the accuraci of this survey as a predict tool
did you ask for specif percentag chang
no  it was direct
so there could be a signific dispers among those who say they   re increas capit expenditur in term of how much they   re increas them by
yes  that   s absolut right   across the bank there was a fair close correspond in the answer to the top line question about increas  decreas  or no chang  but as presid   note  there were some discrep across the bank with regard to the other question   the more support question about whether that was alreadi happen or when the order would be place
okay  thank you
i   ll pass   i was go to talk about the disclosur issu  but i   ll pass at this point
i have a veri brief question on chart      you mention the concept that deflat could be self correct   the exampl you gave obvious was product improv and so forth   are there broader exampl of self correct deflat   i could imagin perhap a chang in exchang rate and a pretti big pass through of that   but what els would one put in the categori of self correct deflat
i think the major instanc that we had in mind was a favor product growth shock  which in our analysi   as we outlin in the paper   shift aggreg demand up fa  than it   aggreg suppli
all right  thank you
you could also get self correct deflat if you had a monetari standard like a gold standard  which we don   t have  of cours   an increas in the product of gold
if there are no further question  would somebodi like to start the committe discuss   first vice presid stewart
thank you  mr  chairman   the new york region economi has shown some sign of improv in the second quarter   employ has recov moder in the past two month  hous market appear to have retain good

citi  which no doubt reflect the veri long lead  e for project approv  on the nation scene we have seen substanti improv in financi market  in survey of consum attitud  and in a number of busi index   given current level of interest rate  the tax cut  increas in feder spend  and the drop in the dollar  a forecast of improv growth is certain reason   howev  we have yet to see ani strong evid of an actual pickup in spend  employ  or product   there has been a rebound in a few sector   particular in travel and recreat  which were heavili affect by the war   but as yet the forecast of overal

that manag and board are spend much of their  e on govern and account issu  which is the caus of a more conserv risk attitud   it   seem quit like that household spend will remain on track and could

thank you  mr  chairman   we have observ onli margin chang and subdu econom condit in the sixth district sinc the  e of the last meet   in fact at our board meet one director suggest that the economi remind him of the movi    ground hog day      the same scene seem to be repeat over and over again   but here   s an abbrevi version of our region stori  retail sale have been grow at a modest pace and are still be driven primarili by promot activ   our tourism and hospit industri have improv in some area  and room rate are actual up somewhat in some locat   low mortgag rate have continu to sustain singl famili hous market  but multifamili construct and nonresidenti construct are still hobbl by excess capac and weak demand   structur adjust continu in our manufactur sector  which remain sluggish except for auto relat activ  similar  activ in petrochem is declin becaus of high natur gas price and burdensom environment rule   as request  we also made some special inquiri with regard to invest prospect  but we were unabl to find ani signific sen ent on the part of busi to invest except to replac depreci equip or to cut cost   such cost cut invest continu to have consider attract   a coupl of compani contact report that such invest were expect to cut labor cost as much as    or    percent   to me this suggest that the outlook for continu product gain is inde real  there   s littl sign of improv on the labor market front except in florida  where the bulk of our district   s econom growth is occur   district employ general remain reluct to hire full  e employe   state govern are adjust to lower revenu by seek new revenu sourc or by make deep cut in spend   certain that restraint will damp somewhat the s ul effect of the recent feder tax cut  final at the region level  price observ in our area have been essenti stabl as increas in price for servic have been offset by continu soft in good price   anoth posit develop sinc our last meet in this    ground hog day    scenario i just paint is that district measur of consum confid are rise and we   re see indic that busi expect have improv   the whisper convers suggest that thing just feel better  which i report at our last meet  have continu  on the nation front  i see a number of margin posit develop   hous remain stabl at a high level  industri product edg up last month  manufactur seem to have stabil  and durabl good order are posit   consum spend is hold it own  and retail sale  exclud auto  seem to be come back   financi market develop have also been posit  with stock market index up signific   interest rate have actual come down across the curv by more than    basi point   busi credit term have eas  busi profit is up  and credit qualiti is accept and not deterior   final  energi price are still down from the high we saw earlier  while my forecast is a bit less exuber than the  book   s   and my own number would be on the low side of those we submit   it seem to me that the economi has turn the corner and is pois to gain momentum   at the same  e  i recogn that the outlook for invest spend and signific job growth over the near term is not as encourag as we might like   and market have built in expect of further eas  look ahead just a bit to the polici discuss  i would suggest that what we say in our press statement today may be more import than our action   the materi present by     emphas the import of align expect to achiev the desir respons to our decis   our statement about disinfl after the may meet clear was respons for the signific declin in rate across the yield curv despit the fact that we did not chang the fund rate   becaus of expect  i believ it is import today to link direct ani polici move that we might decid to make to concern about the fundament in the real economi  i argu for patienc last  e  and i believ we are see a turnaround   not chang rate today  coupl with a posit statement about the recoveri prospect and not say anyth to fuel greater concern about further disinfl  would seem to be a reason polici altern   i would be uncomfort if we justifi a further rate cut by cite concern about further disinfl or deflat rather than it caus   i would not cut rate becaus of a desir to avoid oper problem of the zero bound in the futur or as an effort to get ahead of the curv in anticip of further advers shock to the real economi   i   m convinc that a prompt respons to actual shock is veri appropri  as was the case with the septemb    terrorist attack   sinc shock by definit cannot be anticip  to act in anticip of an unknown shock would in my view simpli wast whatev powder we have left   as for the disinfl argument  i believ it remain a low probabl event for the reason i discuss earlier   the kind of disinfl i think we should be concern about in term of specif polici action is the kind associ with a depress  not problem of the zero bound or wage rigid  i   d like to make one addit observ about expect  though   i think we need to leav a sens that ani downward move in rate is view by us as temporari   if we lower nomin rate to near zero and state public that we intend to keep them down until the economi recov  then there   s a nontrivi risk   especi if the economi weaken further   that the public   s expect for deflat will be heighten   that clear happen in japan   in other word  tri to avoid the japan type of liquid trap could onli increas the likelihood that it will occur becaus of the effect on expect   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  as other have said about their district  the tenth district economi has remain sluggish sinc our last meet but there are some sign of a turnaround and a littl more op    labor market continu to be soft  manufactur activ has not pick up notic  and commerci real estat remain in a slump   state and local govern are also cut back  and in some case they are tri to rais tax or have rais tax in order to balanc their budget  on a more posit note  indic of futur activ have shown some improv  while district firm are still cautious about new hire  they announc far fewer job cut in the last month than in other recent month   also  manufactur    plan for futur capit spend are higher than they were earlier this year   commerci realtor are now expect condit to improv somewhat in the come month instead of continu get wors   in other posit sign  retail sale are hold up  hous activ is still strong  and energi activ continu to expand   i   ll say a littl more on those sector in a moment  on the inflat front  good price have been basic flat sinc our last meet   but manufactur have mention to us that they are see a bit of increas in the cost of good  let me say just a littl more about the manufactur sector   in our survey on capit spend  of those firm that plan to increas capit spend over the next six month about half said that they had alreadi place the order   that reflect some improv from prior survey   i would also note that sever of our director indic that op  was consider higher among small and medium size manufactur than in some of our larger firm  as i note  consum spend has continu to rebound after the dip associ with the iraq war  and hous activ has remain strong   the energi sector is show improv but interest hasn   t improv as much as one might have expect   some individu in our region have told us that an import reason is that they   ve seen price go up befor  have invest to produc more  and then had price fall on them   they   re not anxious to go through that experi again   the farm economi is show improv  as you   ve read elsewher  so i don   t see ani need to comment further on that  let me turn to the nation outlook   i agre that econom forc are in place for a more robust recoveri  make a rebound to trend growth this year and to abov trend growth next year more like now than it seem at our last meet   busi remain cautious  howev  in their plan for capit spend and for new hire   that  of cours  is a concern for the outlook  and i would suggest that the  book   s forecast probabl is a bit op ist  especi compar with our own forecast   but the point is that our recent survey of capit spend and other factor are consider more posit in term of expect   so i expect to see growth pick up to about     percent in the second half of this year   while below the  book forecast  that is still  i think  a veri posit outcom  as for polici  i won   t talk about number  but i believ that the probabl of improv go forward are much better than they were just a short  e ago  at our previous meet   so i look at the possibl of take an eas action today as insur   i think it can be present in that way   in a veri posit light  consist with an improv economi and econom outlook   in my view that   s a good way to think about it and to present it   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   while gather our region inform this  e we were tri to find  as was everybodi els  some sign that econom activ was begin to pick up and turn around   in sum  for our district at least  solid evid of an actual acceler in econom activ is veri hard to find   our various survey  director    comment  and contact with busi peopl all suggest that the district economi is still quit sluggish   i think it   s veri like that some of the sluggish in our region is due to the extraordinari rainfal we   ve had this spring  which almost certain has restrain consum spend and tourism    i   ll refrain from say    damp        laughter   the rain may also be the reason privat hous permit in the first four month of this year were a bit weaker than in the same period last year   that   s not to say that the weather is the reason for all the appar soft in the district   factori output  for exampl  which presum is less affect by the weather  is still contract as index by both shipment and new order   unemploy rate have been rise in all but one of our district state   we don   t see ani signific sign of capit spend beyond ordinari replac spend and routin upgrad of comput equip  so again  there   s littl evid of an actual pickup in activ in our region yet  beyond these report on actual develop to date and in concert with a number of the other comment we   ve heard alreadi  i do think that on balanc busi attitud about the outlook have improv   sen ent is a bit mix  but in general peopl seem more op ist  at our board meet a coupl of week ago  for exampl  one of our director said that he thought we were now at an inflect point in the recoveri   i think that   s an increas preval attitud across the district  at least for now  that   s a good segu to the comment i would offer on the nation economi   like other  we agre with the staff that the prospect for gdp growth through      have improv to some extent in recent week   that   s part becaus of the greater fiscal s ulus now in place than expect earlier but also becaus of the stock market ralli and what seem to me to be a grow recognit that overal financi condit are realli quit conduc to increas busi invest at this stage of the game   i thought one of your chart in the chart show made that point veri nice      so the project we submit  like the  book  call for an acceler of growth go forward though our forecast is not as robust as the  book forecast   we expect a smaller boost from the addit fiscal s ulus than the staff project  also  with respect to price  even if the growth of gdp move moder abov potenti growth as project  it will still take  e to work off the overhang of excess labor that has been build up now for about two and a half year   that will continu to be what i would view as a disinfl impuls at work in the economi  moreov  while we think a moder acceler in growth is the most like outcom  we would not attach an especi high probabl to it   we also believ there   s a relat high probabl of a weaker outcom   after all  even with the iraq war about two and a half month behind us  we still have not seen realli solid evid of a pickup  as mani peopl have said  jami emphas that a coupl of  e  and i think that   s right  most import  while there are a few sign that labor market condit may be firm  they are far from conclus at this point  as the  book indic   strong product growth still appear to be restrain job growth  and if this pattern continu  at some point it   s go to undermin consum confid and consum spend   in that event  core inflat could easili fall below the approxim   percent rate that is now project in the  book baselin through the end of        allow for an upward bias in the index of  say     percentag point  that would impli an inflat rate that   s veri close to zero  and that  obvious  is pretti close to incipi deflat  ten year ago when i would make a comment in a speech or convers advoc price stabil and somebodi would ask me how low i want inflat to go  i would alway say without hesit    zero      i take it back    laughter   to borrow a phrase  i think a sustain rate of inflat below the current rate would be    unwelcom      in my view  there   s a moder high probabl of that outcom go forward

thank you  mr  chairman   my sens of the district economi is that an improv is under way and that it is broad but not deep   by that i mean that the improv is broad in that a number of differ sector or differ compon of aggreg demand are particip in it   but it   s not deep becaus for everi posit read or everi two posit anecdot we get on the district economi we can find a negat one   so to that extent the situat is still mix  homebuild  home sale  and home improv spend remain the foundat of growth   there   s no question about that   those number not onli have held up but have continu to surpris particip in that industri on the upsid   consum spend overal has been expand  but slowli   one get that same sens of the situat on averag whether one talk to major retail and hear their year over year comparison or to manag of larg mall in the district   of cours  it   s not univers true  our survey of capit spend suggest  as did mani other  that there is some improv in train and that some of the order have alreadi been place   that   s clear posit   anecdot from banker  which i think reflect the attitud of their custom and particular their busi custom  are clear more upbeat than they were six or twelv month ago   that   s also true for the most part of activ in the energi and agricultur sector of the economi   put all that togeth  i think thing are improv as for the nation economi  i   ll be veri brief   i think the trajectori of real growth as reflect in the  book is a reason represent of what may happen  although i person couldn   t bring myself to write down number as strong as those in the  book  nevertheless  to me the general  book profil is a reason pictur   our var model show much weaker growth  but becaus it put a good deal of weight on the last nine or ten quarter  it   s not surpris that we get someth weaker out of the var   to me  though  the realli distinguish characterist of the forecast is low inflat   not onli are domest condit right for a continu of low inflat  but if we look beyond our border and consid the global situat   what is happen in place like china and india and so forth   it seem to me that an environ of continu low inflat is a veri good bet   i have a veri difficult  e construct a credibl stori that has ani appreci acceler of inflat in the next year or two   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my contact in the transport industri   at up  fedex  and a veri larg truck compani  j p  hunt   all report that current volum are essenti flat   they don   t see ani improv as yet   the way my fedex contact put it  there   s no increas in the number of packag on the belt at this point  look ahead  my up contact said that  in talk to their custom  he didn   t see ani sign of an increas   noth more than the usual season increas   dure the busi fall season   my fedex contact was a bit more posit   in fact  i wrote down what he said  which was that he was    pretti bullish    on the fall and beyond   i press him on what that realli meant  he said    pretti bullish    mean that he   s a bit more op ist about modest improv activ  up from flat    laughter   i also talk to him about capit spend plan  and i want to make a point here that i view as quit import  and i think it bear on the interpret of the survey evid as well   the capit spend plan for up and fedex are both essenti flat  year over year   aircraft purchas are an import part of their spend plan  but they   re not buy ani new aircraft  all of their purchas are use aircraft from passeng airlin   they put those expenditur into their capit spend plan  and that   s what they report to us   it   not involv new product   now  it   s true that we need to absorb some of the excess capac in industri build and transport equip and so forth befor we see a pickup in product   but we want to be care that we don   t interpret these report as mean that the plan spend is go to feed direct into new product becaus some of it will simpli involv the absorpt of excess capac that alreadi exist in a number of area  i talk twice to my wal mart contact  first on june     when he was particular interest in what was go to happen over the weekend  and i talk to him again the follow monday   what he said on june    was that it  sn   t look pretti   that   s the way he start off his remark   wal mart is see sign of what they interpret as liquid pressur on the household sector   peopl are buy more from need than from want is the way my contact put it   as i   ve said a number of  e in the past  wal mart look care at the way in which spend is relat to the receipt of paycheck   there   s a midmonth paycheck cycl  and wal mart is see more spend around the  e when paycheck arriv   my contact also mention that their new smaller groceri store   i think they   re call new market store and they   re much easier to get into and out of than the big wal mart store   are get more traffic  while they don   t have mani of these new market store  there is an increas frequenc of shop at these smaller facil and a declin frequenc of shop at their larg super center   wal mart   s interpret is that custom want to get in and out of the store quick to get the item they have to have  like toilet paper and diaper  and are not so interest in shop for more discretionari item  my contact said that wal mart is not op ist that the tax bill will have a measur effect on their sale becaus most of the benefit are go to higher incom peopl and not to those who do the bulk of their spend at wal mart   that was wal mart   s expect anyway  he also indic concern about an inventori overhang becaus order were place some month ago and the good to be deliv will exceed what wal mart view as the like demand over come month   so he thought they were go to end up with more inventori than desir  let me make just a coupl of comment on deflat   i think sever differ aspect of this issu need to be sort out   on the demand side  to the buyer of good  what is import  of cours  is not the price now relat to the price last month or last quarter but the expect price in the futur   that is how price is tie in with whether one is speed up or delay outlay   i   m talk about the interact between the price and the quantiti purchas   if you think the good are on sale  you may purchas them earlier than you would otherwis   if you think the good are go to be price even lower next month or next quarter  you may delay your purchas  this appli onli to good that are storabl  not to perish good or servic  you can   t realli store tomato   mayb you can store tomato consumpt util  but you can   t store the tomato themselv   so in term of the behavior of buyer  what matter is the durabl and the rate of obsolesc   i went back and look at the behavior of the durabl good price index and the consumpt of durabl good   what is interest is that durabl good price have fallen in everi quarter sinc the second quarter of        they   ve been declin for a long  e   of cours  some of that involv high tech good  such as comput  but part of it is automobil   so it   s not that declin price per se reduc purchas   if price are declin in a way that  sn   t lead to expect of dramat futur declin  it may not caus peopl to delay purchas   price of high tech good have been declin for a long  e  and peopl continu to buy them  on the produc    side of the market  the issu appli not just to good but also to servic becaus no produc want to put in place expand oper to produc servic or anyth els if he  sn   t think he can recov the cost   so the expect of futur price relat to current price appli across the entir rang of good on the produc side   there the product part is critic   product and  of cours  futur product cost in general  includ wage cost and all other cost   if a produc believ that he can recov those cost  even though the product price are declin  then there   s no reason to pull back from the market  so the price stori clear interact with the product stori and the expect product stori   it is possibl to have a perfect reason equilibrium at high level of employ and product and with ongo price declin  provid that the expect of product growth are adequ to support the continu invest in product facil   i want to make that comment about deflat   i think the deflat stori is not the total stori with respect to the current demand and product outlook   thank you
in the eleventh district  particular texa  we share in the nation mood shift for the better   mayb it   s becaus we   re eat more ketchup  which is a way to store tomato    laughter   in term of employ growth  we seem to have regain our right place as lead the nation averag  we were not lead it for a while   the mood in our region may have been help by the san antonio spur win the nba championship  after knock out the dalla mave  of all team in the division final   and two day ago the rice owl of houston won the nation collegi basebal championship   so we have our three major metropolitan area cover there  san antonio  dalla  and houston  at the recent meet of the confer of chairmen we got an unscientif read on the relat mood in feder reserv district   our chairman and deputi chairman both thought they were gloomi  but they report back that they seem downright upbeat compar with mani of their counterpart from other district   mayb it   s a lesson captur by the song    i   ve been down so long  it seem like up to me      but on a more quantit measur  our employ growth has been posit so far this year   through april  employ grew about    percent  compar with be negat befor that  and in may it grew     percent  so employ seem to be pick up  we have a new    texomet    that classifi econom indic in texa in a rang from hot to cold   we don   t have ani that are actual hot  but almost hot are energi  educ  health  govern spend general  temporari job  and construct   to give a littl detail  in energi the rig count is at it highest level in one and a half year  and we   ve had employ growth in that sector now for three consecut month  which may be lead a bit the develop that jack talk about that were occur primarili in louisiana   in educ  spend is up  and employ is up     percent this year   health employ is up   percent this year  and govern job are up about   percent   moreov   and i believ it   s contrari to the nation experi   our temporari employ

from beig book contact  and the texa lead index   below that in the thaw out categori are high tech and initi claim   still cold are mexico  commerci real estat  multifamili real estat  and manufactur more general   to sum up  our district economi has move from down to neutral with an upward bias  for a longer term perspect i might mention our spaghetti chart  which show employ growth by feder reserv district from differ base period   the oldest base period is the begin of       and in that chart dalla still lead in employ  with kansa citi and atlanta come in second and third   sinc the begin of       san francisco lead  with dalla second and atlanta third   and sinc the begin of       the line up is the same   san francisco  dalla  and atlanta   in recent year the midwe n industri belt state have trail in that measur  rank toward the bottom of the twelv district   rememb that this is just a measur of employ   and go back to       the northea n district trail  turn to the current nation economi  a rebound in the economi is just around the corner  as it has been for some  e now    laughter   it   s a familiar stori   consum spend is follow a steadi upward track while most other hard indic of real activ are rather stagnant   our hope and hunch for an earli pickup in the economi come from a number of develop   a rebound in financi asset price  includ both stock and long term bond  a narrow of risk spread  reflect less perceiv risk in the economi  a prolong polici of easi money and low interest rate  with a recent implicit promis of more to come and for longer than previous thought  progress easier fiscal polici recent augment substanti with a signific tax cut  and a consider weaken of the dollar  especi against the euro   i understand that herb stein is known for say that if someth is unsustain  it won   t be sustain   i hope it   s equal true that if someth is inevit  it will happen    laughter   i suppos it will sooner or later  but the question is whether it will be sooner or later   it bother me that the more op ist outlook reflect in financi market and in survey includ an expect of further eas by the fed   we may be look in the mirror in that regard  for a long  e the  book project underes  real growth and overes  inflat   that has been correct  thank  but we may have overshot a bit   i haven   t look it up  but my impress is that we have overes  both growth and inflat late   in ani case  we   ve made better progress in reduc inflat than we had expect to make   i think we should have celebr for a year or so and taken a few victori lap befor replac our fear of inflat with a fear of deflat   the public and the congress have no idea what a good job the  span fed has done  i tend to be op ist when there is reason to be  which i believ is the case now   i also tend to be op ist when i don   t have a clue  which may be the case now   but i am hope about the outlook on the ground that in this economi over the long run the odd favor op  over pessim   even so  i was a bit taken aback by the strong rebound in real growth that the  book project will begin next week    laughter   i hope it   s right

thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district remain mix   there are some sign of improv  but weak linger in certain sector   while the outlook is margin posit  mani of our busi contact continu to express caution about prospect for the rest of the year   manufactur in our district appear to have stabil this month   our busi outlook survey index of general activ increas to plus   in june  it first posit read sinc februari   the index of new order and shipment also improv  but they have yet to move into posit territori  capit spend in our region has not shown evid of ani signific strengthen  about    percent more manufactur said they plan to increas capit spend over the next six month than plan to decreas it   but that is a low level of the index compar with what we saw in the     s  and it   s even lower than the averag for last year   the special survey on capit spend plan at manufactur and nonmanufactur firm in our district suggest that we will see a modest increas in invest over the next year   similar to the nation  about a third of our firm plan increas in capit expenditur  but it appear that in our region those increas might be more delay compar with elsewher in the nation   for the nation  about two third of the firm said they alreadi had start place order to achiev the invest increas  wherea in our region fewer than half have begun order  our labor market  howev  appear to be do margin better than the nation experi   employ in all three state rose in march  april  and may  after declin in januari and februari   and the unemploy rate in our state fell to     percent from     percent in the first quarter   most of the retail in our area are be cautious in inventori plan as they expect onli sluggish growth in sale this year   although auto dealer report an increas in sale in may compar with april  inventori are well abov desir level except in the import categori   retail of general merchandis report that sale rose in may but remain below year ago level   in their view  consum appear to be limit their purchas becaus of concern about job and incom secur   a point that echo some of the comment of presid pool  the strongest sector in our region continu to be residenti real estat   at our last meet i report that we had seen some eas in the residenti market in recent month   that has now been revers   builder contact in may said that demand for new home pick up in late april and has continu   in contrast  commerci real estat remain soft  with littl chang in recent month   philadelphia vacanc rate have been stabl at about    percent in the citi and    percent in the suburb   quot rent have been fair stabl  but effect rental rate continu to fall   larg amount of space avail for subleas remain on the market  last  e i report that i sens some renew op  and a definit chang in tone in our region sinc the end of the war   i still sens that peopl want to be op ist  but it may be get harder for them to be op ist as the weak continu   mani of our contact say that they   re start to feel a lack of certainti about the recoveri dure the rest of the year  turn to the nation economi  the improv in the financi market indic that began after the conclus of the war has continu sinc our last meet   but in my view the data on the real sector of the economi remain weak   while certain sector have stabil  we have not yet seen sign that the recoveri has pick up the necessari momentum to move to the next step   the financi market indic signal that this will occur   the question is when and then how fast an equilibrium will be reach  the philadelphia fed   s forecast agre with the  book forecast that gdp will pick up  but we expect a more gradual increas than the board staff suggest   we see gdp growth rate be in a rang slight below potenti in the second half of the year and then acceler to somewhat abov potenti in        i might note that our forecast is close to that of the median respond of the most recent survey of profession forecast   the combin of both stronger product growth and weaker gdp growth in our forecast compar with the  book mean that we have slower job growth   while the  book see nonfarm payrol employ growth at         job per month in       we project it at onli         job per month   we see inflat remain low over the forecast period but slight higher than in the  book  the main reason our growth forecast differ from the  book is that we expect a smaller effect of the tax packag   the board staff assum that the provis of the tax law that expir next year will be extend and that household will treat those provis as perman  this impli a sizabl posit effect of the tax law on consum spend   in contrast  given the size of the project budget deficit and the intens public surround this issu  we think the tax cut is like to be perceiv as more temporari  which will limit it effect   we also note that household spent a relat small percentag of the      tax cut  and we believ there   s littl reason to think it will be differ this  e around  especi sinc a smaller fraction of the new tax cut go to credit constrain household than in        also  in our view about half of the tax cut at the feder level will be offset by state and local tax increas   the board staff project a smaller effect there  when we last met i said that it was difficult to assess post   iraq war econom condit  the signal from the financi market were posit   the data on the real sector were weak  but they still larg reflect the influenc of the war   i argu that we need to wait until more data came in befor decid how to respond to the slow growth exhibit in the data and the concern over the prospect of general deflat   those data have arriv   postwar condit show continu sluggish and littl sens of upward momentum   concern about the risk of deflat has grown  in my view  condit suggest that it   s  e for us to consid further monetari polici action  but i think we must be particular care how we explain such a move   the word of the statement becom even more import this  e than usual   if market were not alreadi expect a move  i would be concern that a cut might be misinterpret and perhap even counterproduct   if we decid to move rate lower as insur against the risk of deflat  to use presid hoenig   s word  we should be more explicit in reiter our goal of price stabil on the upsid and downsid   i believ this will give us more flexibl to begin move rate back up in the futur onc we believ the risk have abat and econom condit warrant it  which is like to be befor unemploy rate move down veri much  long run inflat expect have remain stabl  suggest that market particip believ that the fed can fight the risk of deflat in the short run by lower short term interest rate without chang it commit to price stabil in the medium and long term   i think our statement should emphas our commit to this goal so as to prevent even the slightest depreci of the fed   s hard won credibl capit   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with a confess   i   m an outlier  i know this is true in mani respect   laughter  but i   m refer to my forecast for growth next year  which is abov the committe   s central tendenc and close to that of the staff   i base this bit of exuber  which i believ to be ration  on the follow factor   first  we   ve seen tentat and preliminari sign over the intermeet period that the economi is inde begin to strengthen   it appear to be respond to the gradual wane of the hangov in financi market and the real economi from the excess of the late     s and to the moder of geopolit risk that have been associ with the war in iraq   retail sale and industri product pick up in may   labor market have stabil   capit good order and shipment  while no great shake  are still at least consist with a rebound from the except weak first quarter   and purchas manag    survey have turn up   these sign  includ the may order data  for the most part reflect actual transact and decis taken befor the may meet and it consequ  second  there   s now a lot more s ulus come than we had thought at the  e of the may meet to add to the alreadi gather momentum   some of this is fiscal polici  as a number of peopl have discuss  and some of it is our own do   the percept that monetari polici will be easier for longer has help to lower interest rate  increas equiti price  and depreci the dollar  all without rais inflat expect   easier financi condit are not just occur in the unit state   equiti market are up  and long term rate are down all over the globe  though other countri obvious are get the other side of dollar depreci   this improv clear reflect develop in the unit state  but it also probabl build on a percept   reinforc by a signific eas by the ecb over the intermeet period   that monetari polici abroad will be easier for longer  third  although outcom like my forecast or the  book   s seem pretti ebulli  in fact they assum that the restraint on busi spend lift slowli and that the economi   not exhibit all that much resili   these forecast do not assum that the economi exhibit a revers to mean behavior onc the huge amount of s ulus be appli is taken into account   in effect  the equilibrium real interest rate  although rise a bit over the forecast period  remain unusu low and well below what one might think of as the long term natur rate  especi take account of the assum rise in product   in that regard the forecast is somewhat conserv  still  until we see an actual and appreci strengthen of growth  i consid the risk around such a forecast to be weight decid toward the downsid   in fact  the economi has not rebound sharpli from pre war weak   growth in the second quarter is a littl slower in this countri than anticip and much weaker abroad   such downsid risk is reinforc for me by the fact that i realli don   t understand entir what is hold the economi back   perhap  as we   ve specul  the slow busi spend result from a lack of confid after the real and financi turmoil of the boom and bust period   that caution no doubt has been accentu by concern about risk take by ceo and board  given the sever of potenti legal and market punish for get it wrong   these restraint should erod under pressur from rise sale and favor financ term as they do slowli in the staff forecast   but they haven   t erod yet   they could persist and be even stronger than in the  book if busi continu not to see much in the way of profit opportun for invest   busi alreadi are realiz huge gain in effici by util exist capit much better  rapid product growth is boost profit and incom and econom potenti  but it   s not increas the incent to invest  at least so far   the net is that  in mark contrast with the late     s  sizabl and continu monetari and fiscal s ulus has been requir to have even the hope of eat into underutil margin of resourc   we can   t be sure this configur will improv until we begin to see convinc evid of a mark firm in busi spend   until then i think we also can   t rule out the possibl that we may need to reduc interest rate substanti further and hold them there for a  e  intermeet develop have help to allevi some of my concern about the pace of disinfl   the rise in core consum price in may along with the drop in the dollar and elev energi price suggest to me a lower risk that inflat expect will decreas substanti in the near term   stronger demand should limit the longer term disinflationari trend   still  inflat is declin at a  e when it is alreadi near the low end of a rang that   s probabl consist with nomin interest rate that allow us suffici flexibl to respond to ad downward shock   if inflat expect are fall along with inflat  real fund rate may actual be edg higher   moreov  the improv in financi condit after the last meet was built on the expect that  if the economi remain soft and inflat threaten to go substanti lower  we would respond   not onli by keep rate low but by reduc them further   my forecast  like that of the staff  assum that the easier financi condit of the past few week will persist   with strengthen demand still a forecast rather than an actual and inflat still move down  it seem to me that the economi need the extra s ulus from high accommod polici and the more s ul financi condit  and we need to find way in the polici portion of our meet to preserv the financi gain of the intermeet period   thank you  mr  chairman
i   d like to re emphas a coupl of data point  especi some mention earlier in the chart show   the first involv the new tax law   you may rememb that   olin point out some provis of the law that the staff had anticip and some that were unanticip   i would remind you that all of the provis were cram into a tax bill that met the senat   s budget constraint   to do that requir an art amount of postur in order to bring a lot of s ulus into a veri short period of  e   one of the wag write about the tax packag suggest that it has so mani sunris and sunset that it could be call the    fiddler on the roof tax bill       laughter   my point is that veri heavi bet have been made that this tax packag will be s ul in the third quarter  which start next tuesday   i have to say that  whatev els may or may not happen  the tax chang will provid a signific amount of addit discretionari spend capabl start right away   addit incent for busi fix invest begin at that  e also  the second point i would mention is the coupon gap   we move over this issu fair quick  but becaus of the increas in the coupon gap that occur just recent this month  that rate gap is now at a decad high level   there is still a tremend amount of capac for refinanc and an enorm amount of home equiti avail to be tap   so unless mortgag holder have final reach the point at which they are no longer respond to those low rate  we will continu to see refinanc   as a result  one of two thing is go to happen   peopl will have more spend power either from the cash taken out or from reduc mortgag payment  which will increas their discretionari spend capabl   so i am op ist about the prospect for the third and fourth quarter and the possibl that the second half of the year will be as posit as in the staff forecast   that said  the data to this point certain do not indic that there has been a turnaround  so it   seem to me an appropri  e for eas  i would like to make one more point  just to follow up briefli on a comment that i made ye day regard the effect of lower interest rate on the bank industri   as i note  the bank industri in the first quarter had record profit in spite of the fact that bank had a signific reduct in their interest rate margin   but that was onli becaus the provis for chargeoff was reduc signific   and appropri so  given the improv credit qualiti of their loan portfolio   the coverag of loan loss reserv is appropri by ani measur of delinqu or chargeoff on accrual loan   howev  anoth contributor to the profit pictur was the realiz gain on secur  which were as high as they have been for the past ten year  so we   re start to see manag in the bank industri make some strateg decis base on a new interest rate environ   what this suggest to me is that increas we   re go to be hear from a number of sector about the impact of low interest rate on their busi   i think all of us are go to have an opportun in the next few week to remind peopl that we set monetari polici not aim at advantag one sector or anoth but on the basi of it like effect on the overal economi
thank you  mr  chairman   i think al broaddus stole my thunder  but i must say that realli aw weather continu to damp spirit in new england  liter and figur   most of the contact we talk to seem to be   excus the phrase   muddl through   laughter  but there are as yet few truli bright sign   state and local govern in the region all are engross in the process of pass budget that tri to deal with larg structur deficit  the long  slow workout from the demis of the high tech and telecom industri in the bubbl period continu   but a number of our contact say that mani job  even high end job  have move to india and china and won   t come back even when activ pick up   there are worsen problem in medicar and medicaid reimburs and other issu in health care  which is one of the region   s largest industri   even the almost done    big dig      and it   s a good thing that it   s almost done   has start to affect construct employ   so i guess it   s no wonder that mani contact think the region economi has more or less stall  busi confid move down in may  though we have had some report of life in the ventur capit invest bank industri   consum confid has risen  but most about the futur  and confid read about the present are current consider lower than their immedi post   septemb    low   there has been some job growth in the region  and the unemploy rate remain steadi   but the size of the region   s labor forc has begun to erod after grow through the recess and it slow aftermath   the length of the slowdown and the high cost of hous and other live expens in the region may be discourag potenti worker from come into the area or perhap caus some current worker to move out  commerci vacanc rate remain high  though some contact indic that the pace of the increas in vacanc is moder   declin rent and avail space may well be a godsend to some new emerg busi  as one sourc report  but we haven   t seen mani actual or potenti taker as yet  final  an index of lead econom indic for massachusett move into posit territori onc again in march and april   this was base on a rise in the equiti valu of massachusett compani  an increas in demand for high tech product  increas order for comput and electron product  and rise merchandis export   but this index gave posit signal in earlier month that subsequ were taken away   moreov  that index actual has more to say about what the economi may look like six month from now than in the third or the fourth quarter of        in sum  it hasn   t been a great spring or earli summer in new england  we   re hope that thing will get better   the question is when  on the nation scene  i see some hint that a fa  recoveri is in the of   peopl have talk about all of these hint befor   they includ confid read  retail sale  equiti market  credit market  low mortgag rate  a stabil in industri product read  some op  on the part of purchas manag  an uptick in order  a slowli fall dollar  and increas fiscal s ulus   take all these develop togeth  it seem clear that there   s some possibl that econom activ will pick up in the second half of       and it could pick up substanti  but when i think about that  my hope that the rebound in activ will occur is mix with some concern   labor market remain weak  and busi continu to be extrem cautious  focus hard on cost control   this work well for profit margin  and it has kept product growth strong  but it has been hard on employ   the pace of layoff may be eas  but they haven   t stop  and the translat of consum confid into spend in this environ seem  to me anyway  to be vulner   it may be that the new tax legisl will come to the rescu here   but the analys i   ve seen suggest that it is focus on wealthi consum  which lead one to wonder whether it effect on spend  at least in the near term  will be signific  state and local govern spend squeez and the potenti for local tax and fee to go up immedi could drain some portion of the feder s ulus  and consum may well react to their concern about the present by save more rather than spend  with this kind of perspect   on the one hand  hope and  on the other  concern   i was a littl surpris by the  book forecast   with onli a    basi point cut in the fund rate  gdp growth in the next two quarter doubl from that of the first two quarter  and gdp growth in      start with a     as far as we can tell  this forecast would put the  book in second place among the fifti one blue chip forecast  with      growth onli slight behind the project of the forecast that   s in first place  which is an organ call genetski com   the  book forecast for growth is also     percentag point fa  than the next most op ist forecast   or mayb don   s    laughter   true  the unemploy rate drop onli to the mid  s  and inflat is low  but with a pickup of that magnitud  the risk of the kind of deflat that we   re wring our hand about seem rather small to me  it may be that the tax cut  the low interest rate  and a rise in equiti wealth and confid will caus consumpt to take off in      and the save rate to stabil at a level below it histor averag   but i wonder about the likelihood of that  at least in       if employ  sn   t grow by much   and will the jump in consumpt in      along with the expand invest incent in the tax packag realli spur busi invest to grow at a    percent pace in        busi invest level drop dure the recess  to be sure  but they remain at the level of      or        given the caution express by mani busi  i wonder whether the current process of make do and continu to restructur in the context of grow demand will continu   use the same number in the fiscal packag and similar es  of potenti and monetari polici eas  the boston fed   s forecast is much less op ist than the  book on overal growth and busi invest specif   we see      gdp in the mid  s with unemploy remain around   percent  inflat trend down  though veri slowli  and invest grow at about    percent   this is more of a mainstream forecast   it   s like not right  of cours  but i take it and the similar forecast of the blue chip panel to be an indic of some consider downsid risk to the  book project  when we final begin to see solid sign of a pickup   if those sign suggest a pace of growth  especi for       along the line of the  book forecast   i would start to think about when and how we might get polici to a more neutral stanc  recogn that it will take some  e to close the output gap   but for now  in my view the  book is a forecast with more than the normal rang of downsid uncertainti about it  given the unusu natur of the recoveri we   re see   even a more restrain perspect  like our in boston or the blue chip forecast  has asymmetr downsid risk  at least in my es    thus i lean  as i have for some  e  toward take out a bit more insur in the form of an eas move  with the hope that it  in combin with the ad fiscal s ulus  will realli get this recoveri go  in that regard  and recogn that the specif of the polici decis will be discuss a littl later  i do want to indic a bit of concern about use all of our remain ammunit too fast   if activ  sn   t pick up or if some new shock like a terrorist attack or a sudden fall in the dollar were to occur  i   d like to have some room for convent polici to work   deflat is a concern to be sure  but i continu to believ that the type of corros downward spiral that we wit in the     s or that japan may be experienc today has a veri low probabl  lower than the probabl we were talk about this morn   the grow output gap is an import and relat concern   but some straw of a stronger recoveri are in the wind  and  e may be on our side here  i   d move cautious   and i would agre with presid guynn and other who have suggest that what we say now is veri import   we   ve rais the issu of deflat  and we   ve qualifi that definit   at least in chairman  span   s talk about corros deflat  if we could tilt our comment about whatev we do toward indic that it   s a relat normal respons to a slower than desir pace of econom growth rather than the immin of deflat  i think that would be help in the current circumst   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet there was a feel that both the real output term and the inflat term in our polici object function were point downward   the forecast envis persist output gap  and inflat appear to be drop below our desir target rang   not necessarili to deflat  just to an inflat rate below our target rang  over the intermeet period there has been improv on both side   consumpt has pick up and is now forecast to be stronger than befor   hous is maintain it strength   equip and softwar invest is pick up   nonresidenti invest has final stop slide  as has employ   industri product and all the measur of new order have turn around   mani of these turnaround and pickup would be consid still earli return  but turnaround and pickup are better than the altern   on the inflat side  too  the evid is less worrisom than befor   the core cpi and the eci both turn up a bit in the latest data  and all measur of inflat expect are in posit territori  perhap off a bit but not careen toward deflat   it now look as if inflat will settl in at a rate within our target rang  not pierc through the lower bound   there is still a persist output gap in the forecast  so inflat could continu to declin  but again  the situat  sn   t look quit as bad as it did last  e   as   olin point out earlier  mani polici relat variabl have also becom more expansionari late     mention rate spread  the dollar  the tax bill  and the stock market   the usual list  as for the polici action we might take today  i actual think there   s a bit of a problem  there   s a differ between what i will call the level approach and the chang approach   these rough map to the more and the less aggress polici stanc that dave   mention earlier   as argu ye day by the washington  e  one can still make a good case for an aggress monetari polici   output gap are larg  and it would take a healthi expans of aggreg demand for a reason length of  e befor they return to anyth like prefer level   as long as output gap persist  there should be minim posit inflationari pressur  and inde  inflat rate should continu to be stabl or declin   i would remind everybodi that the staff also point out that to ward off these disinflationari pressur  to deal with uncertainti in the rate of inflat itself  and to deal with uncertainti about the nontradit measur that we spoke about ye day  an aggress polici  not a gradual polici  is suggest  from this level perspect  a fair aggress polici still make veri good sens  but from a chang perspect  as argu ye day by the new york  e  the situat look differ   in this view  it is hard to justifi an aggress polici now when we are see more sign of strength and when other polici relat influenc have becom so much more posit   an aggress polici action today would either be or be seen as ad more fuel to a fire that has final start burn   from this chang perspect one might argu for a less aggress polici or even for no chang in the polici stanc   i suppos if press i person might be inclin to split the differ between these two view   i don   t know if dover has a  e  laughter    and argu for a middl of the road approach here  let me just mention one other factor  which is that we do have an opportun now that we don   t alway have becaus the chairman   s tes oni on the semiannu monetari polici report come up in a few week   so we have the luxuri of be abl to do someth today that is more or less a hold action   then  if we see inform on one side or the other that chang our mind in the next coupl of week  we have a chanc to put some word about our view in the chairman   s tes oni   and we know now that our word have enorm effect  thank you
when i came into this meet  i had feel similar to those that presid guynn express   in get readi for today   s meet  i look back at my note on the last coupl of meet and found that we were alway on the verg of a rebound in econom activ   obvious the war erupt and creat anoth discontinu in this expans   i   ll use presid guynn   s    ground hog day    movi analog to say that what is miss is obvious busi capit expenditur   i hope  like the hero in    ground hog day     that ceo will begin to get the messag and start focus extern instead of intern   if we can make that happen  mayb we will have a happi end as the movi did  i   ve been spend a lot of  e look at the data on the busi sector   while i   m not go to go through the point that   made earlier  i thought his analysi was excel in term of describ the status of the busi expans   the new number on nondefens durabl good order this morn may be a sign that we are at the point where there   s a glimmer of hope that we are past the discontinu associ with the war   on the other hand  we   re not realli see evid of a robust movement ahead  and that   concern me   the european central bank has just lower it forecast of growth in the euro area   and as   point out  our staff has reduc it expect for growth intern over the rest of this year   this suggest that we   re not go to get a lot of support from the foreign sector   i am start to see some glimmer of hope in the employ statist   employ is still veri weak  but privat payrol look as if they are begin to stabil   at least they   re not fall off as they were earlier in the year  i   m not as op ist as the staff regard the outlook for        my forecast is at the bottom of the rang of those that we on the fomc submit   it concern me  when i look further out on the forecast horizon  that the output gap is sustain to        given where we are on inflat measur  i   m not so worri about deflat   i am concern about persist disinfl becaus it   s still not clear to me how our bank sector and other sector that have move more toward risk base price of credit are go to work through this   so i   m worri about be in a consist low inflat environ and what that might do to our financi sector   rememb  the last  e we were in this type of situat we had regul q  which prohibit the payment of interest on a lot of the deposit in the bank sector   becaus of the persist output gap and these other consider  i don   t see much downsid risk to tri to encourag this expans that may be get under way and kick it up anoth notch   so  i   m lean toward the view that we ought to go ahead and take out a littl insur at this meet
thank you  mr  chairman   you close our last meet by use a legal term  the concept of the burden of proof   you suggest that the burden of proof at this meet should fall on those who thought they saw suffici growth either in the data or in the outlook that we should stand pat   if i were the judg on the case  i   d say that at this stage the case is unproven  as the british would say
as the scottish would say  not the british
well no  sir   the british includ england  scotland  and wale   laughter
well  you have a law degre and i don   t
we   ll split the differ and call it what an island magistr would say   let me proceed with the evid  if i might   first  on the evid support a sens that thing are look better  i   d have to say that there are a number of straw in the wind in support of that assess   they   ve been talk about here today   retail sale grew respect in may  the labor market appear to be stabil  and the data we   ve just receiv on new and exist home sale are certain a sign of continu robust in that sector   it   s not surpris that the household sector seem reason strong becaus the under fundament for that sector look strong   real dispos incom has improv for a number of reason  the stock market obvious has contribut posit to household balanc sheet  and as was mention earlier  there are ongo opportun for refinanc   and consum confid seem  on balanc  to be firm somewhat   if one move from the household sector to look at the industri side of the economi  again there are straw in the wind   ip has stabil  as a number of peopl have said  and the survey data from both the reserv bank region survey and the ism give a sens of perhap some firm in the manufactur sector   final and most import  as we   ve alreadi note  the financi condit are quit consist with a turn   equiti price are up  risk spread are down  and as   and dino indic ye day  some of the forward look indic of risk also suggest some improv   so there are a number of reason for a bit of cautious op    but i would put the emphasi on    cautious      what  sn   t seem to be there yet is the type of self reinforc improv that we   d need to see befor we decid not to take out some insur today  let me also go through the bit of evid that perhap disprov the case   first  i would say that it   s not realli clear what the financi market are tell us   normal we could look to them to be forward look and to tell us someth about the real economi   as i listen to the discuss ye day and thought about it myself  there seem to be some question about the market    assess of the real economi   as someon said ye day  in part what seem to be drive the fix incom market are a search for yield and an expect that interest rate will remain low   neither necessarili indic that the market see the real economi as improv   if one look at the equiti market  what we heard ye day   which is consist with what i   ve heard and what i   m think in general   is that we are see data from the corpor sector that are not get wors and may be stabil   but the recent data certain are not consist with a rapid turnaround   so i have a bit of a question as to whether or not  as someon said earlier  we may be look in the mirror   at least there is a question as to whether the financi condit are realli support or indic of growth   i would say that they are clear support  i   m not sure they   re yet indic of growth  the second reason i   d be somewhat cautious relat to the fact that i spent a lot of  e in the compani of ceo over the past intermeet period   in my view  they still harbor a fair amount of pessim  a judgment that is share by other who have alreadi comment   i say that becaus of both what the ceo themselv talk about and what they said about the issu on which their board of director are focus   i believ the board continu to be more heavili focus on corpor govern issu and leeri about account issu as oppos to tri to find place to make invest for expans   also  i think order book are not yet suffici full for ceo to have a great deal of confid in move forward   i would argu that the data we   ve seen  which   describ as mild encourag  are no more than mild encourag   that   s not bad  but obvious they do not suggest that activ is realli robust   so i   d put a question mark on the outlook for the corpor sector and particular for the invest side of that  the third area of concern i   d have is the consum sector   while mani of the fundament look good  the fact that the unemploy rate is stay relat high and job creation is relat mute has at least the risk of weigh more on the household sector than it has in the past   i   m not sure that it will  but it might  if one put the two side togeth and add to it the s ulus in the pipelin from monetari and fiscal polici  i can see how the staff came up with the baselin forecast  and i   m not go to quibbl strong with that   but i do believ that the risk to that forecast are primarili to the downsid  nevertheless  even if we take the forecast as given and look out past the next few quarter  we see a number of thing happen   one is that the output gap still close relat slowli   second  the unemploy rate hang up abov the nairu through next year   third  core pce even befor the adjust stay at what i would consid to be the veri low end of an accept rang   add to that the fact that  even in the context of what some view as a relat strong forecast  the staff has lower it expect for core pce over the next eighteen month or so from the es  they had in januari  the other point i would add is that  in it forecast  the staff normal   not in ani sens lead us in term of impli a chang in rate   this  e they chose to put in a    basi point cut and still got to this longer term outlook that i would call onli moder accept if one think about the disinfl pictur in particular   on top of that i   d note the inform provid in chart    of the chart show about the probabl of deflat  given the current low rate of inflat   i would describ that chart as realli quit sober   i would then pick up from where ned   was   which is that  when we get to the polici session  the choic is between a more aggress or a less aggress approach   i think there are legi  argument on both side   i certain think we need to take out at least some insur  and i   ll wait until the polici round to talk about what i think that should be   thank you veri much  mr  justic
is that a demot    laughter
if you went to law school  it   s not so bad
thank you  mr  chairman   the economi seem pois for recoveri in that polici is accommod and the financi market are support   but on the ground where it count we have not yet seen clear evid of a turnaround in invest or hire  moreov  we have more than the usual degre of uncertainti about the amount of slack in the economi  which impli that we face high uncertain downward risk to the alreadi low rate of inflat   for these reason  it   s extrem import that we do what we can to maintain the support configur in financi market   that mean continu our easi monetari polici and  even more import  use our statement to signal our willing to keep polici easi so long as there is a risk of further disinfl and continu econom weak  if you will indulg me  i   d like to take my  e to add a few word on communic polici in general   our discuss ye day and our experi of the past year have shown that effect communic is a big part of success monetari policymak   it   s becom increas more import as the inflat risk move from one side to symmetr and as the rang in which we can move the fund rate narrow   we can communic to financi market how we expect to manag short term interest rate in the futur   if we then follow through on our commit  the power of our interest rate instrument is multipli mani  e over  contrast the effect on financi market of our    basi point eas of last novemb with our no chang polici of may     the differ lay entir in the accompani statement and not in the decis themselv   the may   statement prove that pure qualit statement can be effect when polici intent are convey to the market   nevertheless  communic that is entir qualit in natur also risk misunderstand   for exampl  i think the may   statement left the mistaken impress with some that the fed was concern about the threat of immin deflat as oppos to what realli concern us   name  the possibl of a declin in inflat to a level that  while below the desir rang  would still be greater than zero   this mispercept may have led to unnecessari anxieti among the less sophist and to skeptic about the fed   s serious among the more sophist   this misconcept can be clear up  but as we go forward  the subtleti will multipli  particular as the recoveri pick up and as we make the inevit but veri t i transit from deflat fight to inflat fight  i expect that the need to make our public statement more precis and less ad hoc will ul  lead to the introduct of some element of quantif   there are differ way to do that   one approach would be to provid guidanc to the market by issu a work definit of price stabil express as a rang of measur core inflat that take into account measur bias and the need for a buffer zone against deflat   in issu such guidanc  the fomc would not need to make ani explicit commit  onli indic that this work definit of price stabil would be use as a guidepost in it pursuit of it dual mandat relat to price stabil and sustain growth  this is not the place to get into detail about ani specif propos   i do think  howev  that this measur or similar one would help us enlist the financi market  particular the bond market  in stabil the economi   the reason is that ani tendenc of inflat to move out of rang   either up or down   would tend to move longer term bond yield in a stabil direct in anticip of the forthcom polici respons   ambigu has it use but most in noncoop game like poker   monetari polici is a cooper game   the whole point is to get financi market on our side and for them to do some of our work for us   in an environ of low inflat and low interest rate  we need to seek ever greater clariti of communic to the market and to the public   thank you

down to   percent today  all envis the real fund rate be move up to it long run equilibrium level of about    percent over the cours of one year   they differ as to whether that adjust take place in             or        the punch line is given in the two bottom panel   the committe could move the fund rate   percentag point lower from it current level and not have to revers that action for     year while still keep inflat on a gentl downward trajectori toward   percent  as close to price stabil as one might imagin   perhap too close for some  in light of the renew import of a cushion of inflat to protect against the zero bound to nomin interest rate   one way to fatten that cushion is to eas    basi point today on the expect that ani revers would be delay for some  e   anoth way to fatten the cushion  as list at the top of exhibit    is to eas    basi point today   in one sens  such a polici move would mere reestablish the degre of monetari polici accommod of late last year   as seen by the thick solid line in the middl panel  the ex post real fund rate has move up from the level prevail in the second half of       mirror the declin in inflat  while it equilibrium valu   at least as gaug by staff model   has been a move target that fell over the same period   while the staff anticip that a quicken of aggreg demand is immin  it assess of aggreg suppli is such that an eas of    basi point would seem to posit polici better to support a more rapid rundown of slack   moreov  the committe might harbor some reserv about the staff project that spend will show such vigor   given the lag in the effect of monetari polici  action today will most shape econom condit next year   as shown in the bottom left panel  in the list of the project for gdp growth and the unemploy

even more stock in is your own   as     report earlier this morn  the central tendenc of your econom project for       not shown  are that real gdp grow at    to    percent  the unemploy remain around

by a taylor style rule use those forward look forecast and a lag depend variabl to captur gradual   by that standard  as plot in the red dot line at the bottom right compar with the actual fund rate in black  your current econom forecast would call for put the polici rate at near   percentag point if you were to oper as you had over the prior ten year   altern  it is possibl that the committe view the risk to it forecast of econom growth as especi suscept to upsid surpris  perhap to the point of argu for keep the fund rate unchang  the subject of exhibit     eas might be view as unnecessari becaus consider fiscal s ulus is in train   as shown in the middl left panel  the staff es  that fiscal impetus will to rise to an eye pop    percent of nomin gdp this year  move it into a rang rare seen in the past forti year   given the complex of the recent legisl  there   s a larg amount of judgment in forecast how much kick there will be to household and  especi  busi spend   if the staff has shade it es  of the effect too much  there would be an even more mark pickup in growth than in the  book   a mute respons to invest incent and a slow dissip of the gloom that has damp

rang of postwar experi  the shade area    if you think we are about to see a rebound in invest more in keep with it typic cyclic amplitud   that is  the  book is too pessimist   the correspond need for monetari polici s ulus would be lessen   you may also have the sens that econom expans had alreadi gain suffici traction from the ongo rapid growth of liquid   the four quarter growth of real m   the red line in the bottom panel  and real bank credit  the black line  remain robust and in a rang typic associ with contemporan growth in activ   like  though  the question is not if but by how much to eas polici   after all  the committe left it may meet with a strong presumpt that it would eas polici today  leav the burden of proof to those who believ the economi had pick up enough to make such an action unnecessari   although the tone of recent read has brighten  at best the scottish   and perhap english   verdict of    not proven    is in order   your last exhibit examin the committe   s assess of the risk to the outlook by first bring up a procedur question   on may    the committe separ the risk assess into statement about the risk regard it object of sustain econom growth  risk regard it object of price stabil  and an overal balanc of those two risk   howev  as was the case in march  but not the previous three year  the committe vote onli on the polici rate and not on the risk assess   i assum in the bluebook that you want to return to the practic of vote on the assess of risk so that it had the full forc of the committe   s imprimatur   but given the numer  e in the past that member have indic that it would be unwork for the statement to have nineteen editor  i also assum that you would not want to review it routin befor the vote  except  as in may  when substant chang to the format seem to be call for   to solv this govern puzzl  i suggest in the bluebook that the committe choos among generic formul of the part of the risk assess to allow some discret to the drafter   that is  when the  e come  the deputi secretari would read a singl propos put on the tabl by the chairman that wrap togeth a decis of the intend fund rate and direct for each of the three part of the assess of risk   as for today   s choic  as consid in the bottom left panel  almost regardless of your decis on rate  growth rate risk would seem to be balanc   similar  with inflat edg down from an alreadi low level in most forecast  risk to the committe   s goal of price stabil would seem to be to the downsid   as a result  the overal balanc would presum be to the downsid   conceiv  the committe might view a    basi point eas as suffici to balanc the risk  similar to the action it took last novemb   there   s some sen ent in the market for this  in that in the latest money market servic survey  the bottom right panel   almost half the respond who thought the fund rate would be    basi point this afternoon also thought the committe would opt for balanc risk   but it   seem a stretch  in that fo  a sens in the market that the committe want to draw this eas cycl to a close would undercut some of the s ulus of a    basi point move   that conclud my prepar remark  mr  chairman
thank you   question for
ye day a number of peopl rais the question     if zero isn   t realli the lower bound  what is      i think there was a general feel that we don   t know what the lower bound is but that it   s below    basi point   if we went to a fund rate of    basi point with a balanc risk statement  would we build in a market impress that that   s as low as we   re go to go
i think there is a risk that move to balanc in the current circumst would be interpret as have the fund rate as low as the committe realli want it to go   given that there is a mispercept that    basi point might be the bottom end of your comfort zone  i think it may veri well turn out that way
i have two question      first  if we look at the middl chart in exhibit    which show the actual real feder fund rate  the current real rate has move up sinc the last meet   how is an eas of    basi point an insur polici
it is the case that    basi point would not get you to as easi a polici as  say  in the first half of last year
or about six week ago
but it   s also the case that your sens of the forecast go forward is probabl more posit than it was a year ago or even in may
okay   second  i just want to rais an issu  and if this is the wrong  e  i can come back to it   in exhibit   in the bottom left hand corner  the panel entitl    for today   s choic    say that the growth rate risk are balanc   the issu i want to rais at some point relat to the word    sustain    that show up as an adject in our statement   i realli think the way we use it the last  e was wrong   i check how we   ve use it in the past  and i think it was differ   it seem to me that the problem could be fix veri easili by use the word    accept      i may be focus on a point that seem narrow to some  but i just don   t think    sustain    was the right word the last  e  and i can   t see how it would be right this  e   i don   t know if you   ve given ani thought to that or come to ani conclus about it  so i want to mention it   or should we talk about that later
one thing i have learn is that peopl read differ thing into the word    sustain      i think some member would view the word    sustain growth    as say the growth rate of potenti
befor may that is exact what it meant
wherea i think other have felt that the word    sustain    also includ a level concept to it   that is  if the economi is well below it level of potenti  the growth rate that it could sustain for the next sever quarter is actual higher than that of potenti
well  it seem to me it   s a littl problemat to view it one way one month and a differ way anoth month
i think the word is ambigu   and that   s one reason i would like at some point to put on the committe   s agenda a discuss of it communic polici
mayb this is go to have to wait until your discuss of communic  one of the other thing i struggl with as i read the bluebook word    and i see it again in exhibit   in the bottom left box   is the part about inflat risk be on the downsid   as worri as i am about disinfl  which i see as a signific risk  i am not worri about inflat down the road   if inflat were around   percent  we   d be worri about the risk of a rise in inflat   risk to me alway impli someth about what could be the worst outcom rather than direct   given where we are now with regard to inflat  i   m wonder if we should impli concern about inflat   s move in one direct onli rather than the risk of it go up or down   get back to governor bernank   s comment  how we communic our view on inflat is import   becaus we   re in such an unusu situat  i think direct word might be better than the word    risk
in my propos and in the propos in the bluebook i was tri to come up with word that were as generic as possibl with regard to inflat   i think the may   statement serv the committe well by indic a direct   the unwelcom risk of a substanti further fall in inflat from an alreadi low level   i   m not propos this word as part of the press statement for today   s meet but rather as a way for you to convey your view about the direct in the statement
could i just interject one point becaus it follow direct
yes  go ahead
this may be just my own defici  but when we talk at the end of the last meet about separ the two part of the statement  we were basic do so on a wait and see basi   we vote on the polici action  and then we wait to see the word of the draft statement   i did not say to myself at that point     aha  we are not vote on the risk     make an issu out of that in the minut struck me as a littl odd   i don   t know if anyon els share that same impress   mayb my memori or my understand of what we were do is defici   i thought we were focus on a new way of talk about where we were  but i certain thought that we had a share understand of the risk
it was impli that you were vote on the risk  but when it came to the actual vote and what normand read to you befor the roll call  you vote onli on the interest rate decis
okay   i thought that was more or less becaus we hadn   t seen the formul of what the statement was go to say about the risk   i didn   t view it as a substanc issu   mayb i   m make too much out of it   at the  e we had the vote  had we seen the statement   did we see it befor the vote
yes  we hand out the draft statement befor the vote
then i must be out to lunch
all i realli want to do was to get the formal process back to the point where the committe actual   formal vote on the two aspect of it decis
i want to follow up on governor bie   s question  just so i understand this   in the bluebook  the risk assess languag indic that we   re go to say one of three thing about inflat   the risk to the outlook for inflat over the next sever quarter are weight to the downsid  are balanc  or are weight to the upsid   so will that be in the statement that come out
not necessarili in those exact word  but that sens would be in the statement   there will be a declar sentenc about inflat  and it will follow the direct that the committe indic
so the risk assess paragraph will not be in the statement
not word for word
but it will be in the transcript
it will be in the transcript  yes  and it will be in the minut
further question   let me then start   within a matter of day we should begin to experi a rare test of an econom theori and approach to econom polici   we current are observ a sluggish economi that seem to be stabil but is scarc exhibit ani robust dynam   over the cours of juli and august  some     billion of treasuri receipt will be transfer to household   our general view of the way the econom world work  essenti go back to keyn   s general theori  is that this shift of fund will have a prompt and signific impact on consumpt expenditur and econom growth   secondarili  work through the acceler effect on capit invest  the pickup in spend should fo   in the classic case  an econom rebound consist with the forecast in the  book  the recent legisl clear requir that     billion or so be shift to household over the next sever week   that   s not an expect   it will happen   the reason we all expect person consumpt expenditur to rise  of cours  is that the presum margin propens to consum is greater than zero   if one postul that the margin propens to consum is liter zero and that all we   re see is a transfer from the govern   s save account to household save account  then the onli result will be a shift in save from one sector of the economi to anoth  with nation save unchang and econom activ not direct affect by that transfer   no econometr model of which i am awar has a zero margin propens to spend   but even if our model were to have that properti  there would be an increas in household wealth and an increas in the ratio of wealth to incom   although in this model expenditur would not occur out of incom  they would occur in much smaller dimens from the increas wealth effect   so there would still be some effect  the reason that this is such an interest and critic test is that we are not in the middl of either a vigor expand economi  in which it would be veri difficult after the fact to isol the effect of the tax cut  nor are we in a signific weaken economi  in which it would be difficult to extract the momentum stem from the infus of treasuri cash   as a consequ  we are in a veri rare period in which we will have the opportun to observ a fundament test of the signific of fiscal polici in the economi   we will probabl know a lot  i would suspect  by mid august   we may even learn someth prior to my monetari polici report to the congress  which is current schedul for juli     although i would not count on that   the test on the effect of fiscal polici will involv a process that will be report on in a veri detail manner by the press  and i suspect we   re also go to learn a great deal anecdot about what is go on  if it turn out that there is veri littl impetus to consumpt or capit invest  that is go to alter our view of the effect of fiscal polici quit materi   it   s hard to accept the view that there will be littl or no effect on pce on the ground that a larg portion of the tax cut benefit upper incom group  which is certain the case  to be sure  the convent wisdom is that the margin propens to consum is veri signific lower for upper incom group   but i must tell you that in some of the studi we have carri out use data system that combin our flow of fund data and our survey of consum financ  we have pick up margin propens to consum for the upper incom group that  while lower than for the middl and lower incom group  are not that much lower   so one can   t argu that we are go to get littl or no effect  at least on the basi of the data i   ve been look at  mere becaus of the incom distribut of the tax cut  of cours  there   s a more interest and in a sens more import issu as to whether capit expenditur will reviv in this context   to an import extent  the evid will be anecdot  and i hope we will get greater insight from that sourc over the next month or two   i sens from convers with various busi peopl that the restraint on capit invest is realli a restraint on ani form of aggress risk take  that seem to be in part a reflect of the corpor govern scandal  which have induc a consider amount of fear on the part of corpor execut   a few year ago  a ceo would present a capit invest project to a board of director  go through the detail  and typic get agreement and approv fair quick   the board of director were essenti passiv in that process becaus there is no way that their state of knowledg could possibl match that of the ceo back up by the cfo and a whole panopli of chart and detail data on the intern work of the firm   in fact  it realli isn   t the job of board of director to look too deepli into the detail  it   s more a process issu  inde  that   s the way it has work  today it is quit differ   the legal risk  which both the board of director and the ceo perceiv  have led both to exercis a high degre of caution   director  and i say this onli half faceti  who realli know noth  now aggress question propos capit invest without a clue as to what is go on   it is true  if one look veri close at the detail of the sarban oxley legisl  that the crimin statut in that law are quit appropri in the sens that they stipul will  aggress action for perpetr of decept or fraud   by ani character i know of  peopl in the busi communiti who are guilti of such theft ought to be in jail   there is no way around that conclus   regrett  the interpret on the part of a signific portion of the corpor communiti is that the divid line between crimin and permiss activ is not clear  so they are lean over backward and exercis except caution   that has creat  as best i can judg  a degre of risk avers well beyond anyth that one could observ previous in the busi communiti  inde  the financi data clear suggest that risk avers as perceiv by investor is veri signific less than that perceiv by corpor director and execut  so it strike me that we are in an interest test period for our forecast capabl and henc policymak   fortun  i suspect that we   re go to learn a great deal over the next two month  but it   s veri difficult to judg the outcom in advanc   so far as today   s polici decis is concern  as has alreadi been mention  we conclud at the end of the may   meet that the burden of proof would essenti ride on whether suffici inform had emerg dure the intermeet period to persuad us not to reduc the feder fund rate target at this meet   as judg   veri sensibl rule  by ani measur the threshold of the evid need to forestal a cut in the feder fund rate at this meet has not been reach   i agre that an eas action is the right thing to do  we have been consid reduct of    or    basi point   i   m uncomfort with    basi point for sever reason   as has been mention  if we were to approv    basi point and then adopt some kind of balanc risk assess  i believ we would generat the expect that we are no longer contempl a lower rate structur for an extend period of  e   as a result  i think we would begin to get veri signific upward movement in long term rate  that outcom would be quit counterproduct at this stage unless the  book baselin forecast turn out to be right   but that forecast has a veri low probabl as far as i   m concern   it point to an outcom that would be delight if it were to materi  but it is not a prospect on which we should focus our polici at this point   so the issu is whether  if we were to reduc the fund rate by    basi point  we   d have to do it with a presumpt that we would reduc it still further   i   m fear  as mani have suggest  that that would creat a view that we are far more concern about the economi than is in fact the case and that we know someth that the market don   t know   that could result in a quit counterproduct reaction  the reaction to the may   statement should tell us that the credibl of this institut has increas veri materi in the past six month to a year   even though survey of economist show them to be far from prepar to address the deflat concern that we have public express recent   and henc a veri substanti proport of them do not perceiv that a lower rate is the right choic at this stage   half or more are forecast that we will lower it   but that   s not their recommend   basic they are forecast what they think we will do rather than what they think is right   that leav us with a sens that  becaus we have a credibl posit that peopl respect  if we were to decid on a    basi point rate cut and suggest that we remain concern about have to lower the rate still more  it would lead to result that i don   t think we would particular like  that lead me to the conclus that the reduct should be    basi point and that we should use word in our press statement similar to the word we adopt at the may meet   we need to convey the notion that we may not have complet our eas and that we are still watch ongo develop in that regard   i believ  howev  that we have to acknowledg that econom condit have improv  as inde they have  and that the probabl of signific more posit develop start soon are clear better than          so what i want to put on the tabl at this stage  and i hope it   s accept  is to move the fund rate down    basi point  maintain the assess that the risk to sustain econom growth are balanc  but continu to impli that the risk of ignit inflat are veri low   the latter clear impli that polici eas insur is except low price and that we forese low inflat as the like environ in which we are go to function for the period ahead   i don   t know how the market will respond to all of that  but if our purpos is to maintain the extraordinari communic success of our may   announc  in my judgment this statement is as close as we can get   that  therefor  is what i would put on the tabl   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i support the recommend  and let me explain my reason in the follow way   i am schedul to give a speech next week  and as i think about it  the polici stanc you   ve just describ make me comfort that i will be abl to give that speech   in other word  i do think that the outlook is posit   i don   t know if it   s as posit as the  book or as posit as we hope  but i think it   s posit   howev  i believ that the cost of insur is fair low and a   point cut in the fund rate target is to me a reason insur polici   if we went more than   point  sell the idea that the economi is pick up and that the outlook is favor would be much harder  that would be veri difficult to communic   so i support your recommend strong
first vice presid stewart
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i agre that there is no clear sign of a recoveri  and it seem to me that we need to back up our antidefl reput  i would not go to a    point cut in the fund rate object becaus it seem appropri   to recal some of my nautic train of year ago   to go slowli in unchart water   at these level of rate we don   t know what the impact on the financi industri will be  and i like the idea of give the bank  money market fund  and consum  e to adjust to these low rate
mr  chairman  i agre with your recommend and i also veri much like the way you got there   i think we do want to reestablish an accommod polici  which mean the choic is between    and    basi point   given the fiscal s ulus in the pipelin and given some of the incom data that suggest a pickup in econom activ     basi point may be a bit too much   as i   ve listen to the discuss today and thought about it  i must say that i would like to have a bit more of a cushion   but if thing unfold in a negat way  i think we will have  e to provid more of a cushion   i strong endors what we   re tri to do overal  which is to send a veri clear signal that we   re prepar to be accommod now and prepar to be accommod for some  e if we have to be  work with the risk assess the way you   ve outlin seem quit consist with that last statement  i think it might send that signal   there is some risk that we   ll disappoint the market to some degre  but i don   t think this action will backfir on us   so i   m veri comfort with your recommend and the way you got there
mr  chairman  i realli have a prefer for a cut of    basi point  in part becaus of the argument that were made by governor     in addit to that  it seem to me that    basi point would actual more than offset the declin in expect inflat and  therefor  the increas in the real fund rate that has occur sinc the last meet   to me a    basi point cut mere undo an inadvert tighten brought about by declin inflat expect   and if that   s the case  it   s hard for me to conceiv of a cut of    basi point as take out an insur polici   it just get us back to where we were
mr  chairman  i support the    basi point reduct  and i think your discuss about the statement is right on the mark   it   leav open  of cours  a possibl of anoth    basi point cut in the futur   that   s part of the purpos of do it this way   that be the case  we will get question about where this eas process might end   whether there   s a possibl of anoth    beyond that   in address those question we could punt and say that we   ll cross that bridg when we get to it   i don   t believ that would be the wise thing to say   i think we need to be talk in much more definit term about what it would mean to move to a so call nontradit polici   it   s not that we expect to get there  and we should emphas that   i certain don   t anticip that we will get there   but i think we need to have a coher view of what it would mean if we did   that   s becaus such a polici regim is not over the horizon as a remot possibl from the perspect of the marketplac but it   s actual out there on the horizon as a genuin possibl   in my view the market understand of what it would mean is veri  veri weak   i don   t think peopl know what it would mean   if we do get to that point  it will be import for us to make sure that money growth remain substanti  and i would want to emphas that we will pump fund into the system to be certain that happen  that   s essenti what it mean if the fund rate actual goe to zero from  e to  e   i think we need to talk about that becaus peopl will be ask us about it
well  i think we have a problem in the sens that the market don   t know veri much about it and i   m not sure we do either   that is  we know what the nontradit activ are  but we don   t know how the market will respond to a whole new set of monetari polici procedur   we do know that uncertainti of this natur will increas risk premium   it has to   anyth new  good or bad  increas risk   one reason that i   m reluct to move the fund rate target down    basi point is that it get us closer to the point where we will have to address the issu veri immedi   i say that becaus i agre with you   i don   t think that the market have a clue  realli  about what nontradit type of polici would mean   we could handl it in the upcom monetari polici report if we knew much about it   i frank would prefer to avoid that in the hope that this economi will start to pick up  which would make that convers moot   i   m not sure that we could convey to the market a sens of confid that the transit from the tradit to the nontradit would not rais risk premium   unless we can do that  we are in a veri difficult posit   i would hope that keyn prevail  which is someth i rare say   laughter  and that this economi pick up and take that issu off the tabl   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend   i do think we need to follow our talk with action   as for the size     versus    basi point  i recogn as presid parri said that one could make a case for    on the ground of be aggress and get ahead of the problem   but i think    is appropri size for the situat  given that we do see sign of some improv and there   s a lot of s ulus in the pipelin   i believ that the    basi point cut taken togeth with a sens of downsid risk to inflat should limit ani upward ratchet of interest rate from what littl disappoint there will be in the market   like presid pool  i presum that if we don   t get the rebound that we   re look for in the third quarter  we   re go to have anoth serious convers in august about whether we need to move further  let me make a coupl more comment on some of the thing that have been said   i do have a littl concern about the sens that we might shi away from a rate cut that we think is need becaus of the signal that such a move would send to the market   if i thought    basi point were the appropri action  i would argu in favor of that  and i would have confid in our abil to explain it  though it would be veri difficult to shape our messag so that we weren   t send the wrong signal   i would worri if i thought that concern about the messag be sent kept us from do the right thing   in my view it   s the combin of our word and action that will shape market expect and confid   i think we can put the two togeth in a way that we get out the messag we want to send  let me touch on a few more thing that were mention   the word    sustain    in my mind is growth at potenti   the way i see the three sentenc in the balanc of risk statement is that the first sentenc is about the output gap  the second sentenc is about the inflat gap  and the third sentenc add it up   so if i think the first sentenc is about the output gap  sustain to me mean growth at potenti   interest  relat to what governor bernank said earlier today  the forecast that we   ll be put out are for growth abov potenti and are not entir consist with the statement that we   re like to put out   how we   re go to handl the balanc of risk languag may be more of a problem go forward if growth actual   pick up   i don   t think it   s a problem for today  final      s chart in the top left hand panel of chart   brought home to me that actual it wasn   t so much the releas of the word in our press statement that result in the chang in financi condit  it was all the thing that follow  includ our own statement  it involv the interact of what we said later and the data that came out relat to what we had said earlier   mani of us  myself includ  were a littl surpris by the reaction to some of the thing we said   to the extent that some of us have express concern that there   s too much talk of deflat   that peopl don   t understand that it   s disinfl we   re talk about   i think we all  present speaker includ  need to be veri cautious about what we say   we need to be care that we   re not confus the situat and fan concern that are not appropri  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i find today   s decis a veri hard call becaus  in addit to the spend uncertainti issu that you mention  we have all the uncertainti   i   ll call them the unchart water uncertainti   that we talk about ye day and how to deal with those   so this  e it has been difficult for me to figur out what i think we ought to do   therefor  i support what i   ll term your middl of the road hold action   it  sn   t go too far wrong in ani dimens and it might even be just right   in addit  i would like to support don in what he just said   i   ve alway been uneasi about this argument that if we move    basi point we send a messag of fear   i would question that  part for the reason that don mention   if the economi is realli that shaki  mayb we should go
well  that   s what we did in januari        the market did not expect us to go     but we chose to do that  and we were fulli cogniz of what was involv   so i don   t think there   s realli a disagr on how to proceed if a larger move is necessari and that   s what we want to do   i   m refer onli to the type of action when the market misread what we do becaus their interpret involv a combin of what we said previous and what we are in fact tri to do   if we have to move  market reaction to the move cannot be a consider   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  like ned  i think it   s a veri tough call this morn  clear the choic for me is between the   point and the    point reduct   as i see it  we have a signific risk of further disinfl   we   ve said that public   also  as i said in my comment about the economi  i do believ that an acceler in econom growth is the most like outcom  but i don   t think that has a particular high probabl in relat to other possibl outcom   in my view there   s a strong probabl of a weaker outcom than that  and i think we need to move forc and decis against those downsid risk at this meet  moreov  i realli don   t see much risk in do that   to put the issu in a longer term context  i   ve been attend these meet for a long  e  and it seem to me that often we   ve gotten into troubl when we have not move quick in situat where we   ve seen a signific risk in one direct or the other   we haven   t been will to move as forc as we should have  so  like bob parri  i have a strong prefer for a    point reduct  i have just a coupl of addit comment   i   m worri  look forward  about how this situat might play out if these downsid risk remain in the pictur   if we move   point now and then by the august meet or the meet after that we don   t see much progress  we may be face with have to take stronger action at that  e   i don   t know exact how that would go  but we could end up with an even lower fund rate than otherwis and that prospect bother me a littl   on the issu of the signal and whether peopl would view a    basi point cut as suggest that we see someth the public  sn   t see  that to me would be an advantag of what i understood governor bernank to be recommend   if we communic clear to the public all of this inform   what our real concern are and their relat import   i think that would deal with the issu   anoth thing that bother me about a   point reduct is that some peopl may conclud that the reason we decid on   point rather than    point is becaus we   re worri about the zero bound   we had a wide rang discuss of that ye day  with a lot of view express   one thing i took away from it was at least a reason degre of confid that somehow or other we   ll deal with that problem if we have to   i   m a littl worri that a cut of onli   point today might suggest to some peopl that we   re not confid of our abil to do that   i   m go to support the recommend  but i must say it   s a tough call for me
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i have to admit to be still a bit uneasi  until we see the draft press statement in a few minut  becaus how we talk about the disinfl risk concern me   when i look at the tabul of our individu forecast for inflat next year  i don   t see ani statist signific further declin in our inflat expect   so i find it hard to read into the convers i   ve listen to and these forecast a great concern among us about inflat fall rapid over the period ahead  therefor  i hope that we won   t creat the mis impress in the statement that we see a bigger risk than our forecast seem to suggest  that   s not what i see when i look at our forecast  nevertheless  i   m support of your recommend  and i will vote for it
i support your recommend for lower the fed fund rate at this meet  mr  chairman   i would have prefer a bit more decis action   my concern is that for the next two month we   ll be talk about this among ourselv and the press will be ask what we   re go to do next and whether we plan to stop at   percent   wonder if perhap there   s a littl fear associ with break   percent   but it   s clear the case that a reduct in the fund rate is in order to get the economi back to an accept growth rate  so i support your recommend
presid  n
i  too  support your recommend  mr  chairman   it seem to me that this addit s ulus is veri low cost at this point  so i think it   s the right thing to do   i also support the idea of reinforc the signal that we sent to the market the last  e about our view on interest rate level and so forth   i   m not sure about the best way to do it   mayb when the draft statement is avail  that will clarifi it  at least for me   i have one other  perhap somewhat gratuit  comment   it seem to me that when inflat is run at   percent plus or minus   and it may be more minus than plus   there   s not much of a distinct between be concern about further disinfl or about deflat   we   re just not veri far from deflat  so i   m not sure that tri to make that distinct in our public comment is go to turn out to be veri product
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the way that roger   phrase the issu   that the threshold of evid provid by the data sinc our last meet was not suffici for us not to chang rate today   so i do agre with the    basi point cut and the way you phrase the balanc of risk   but of cours the data we talk about are alway look backward  and the key is the forecast go forward   as we   ve often said in these meet  some  the last cut or the last increas in the fund rate target is the one that   s not need becaus we didn   t have perfect inform at the  e we made that cut or increas   i certain hope that   s true this  e  and i hope we won   t have to move forward with ani nontradit form of monetari polici  i do want to say a word about the risk statement  though   in my view   has done an admir job in tri to take the word of our statement from the last meet and to put it into this old framework that we had for the balanc of risk   on an interim basi  i think that   s fine   but i believ   and i   m go to sound like a broken record here becaus i recommend this at the last meet   that a subcommitte of this committe should be appoint to look at this in more detail  as was done in past   the most recent such subcommitte was the one that roger chair  and there were sever presid and sever member of the board on it   this is a veri t i area   a coupl of point have been mention here today   governor bie has concern about the phrase    downsid risk    with regard to inflat  and bob parri is worri about the word    sustain      don kohn made a veri good point that down the road  when we   re look for sustain econom growth  we may not want to say that the risk is weight toward the upsid   so i think a group of us should look at this in more detail and come back with a recommend to this committe regard how to deal with this on a longer term basi
whi don   t you survey the member and rather than get into a discuss right now  becaus obvious we don   t need to do that today
no  i   m talk about the longer term
i understand   it   s a veri critic question of how we ought to proceed to get our communic issu straighten out   we   ve move forward sinc the last meet  and appar effect  but that   s not the end of the game   governor bie
mr  chairman  i can support your recommend   like sever other  i was torn between    and    basi point   but as you put it veri well  we have a huge s ulus come with the tax packag that   s about to take effect  and in accord with tradit econom theori  that should provid the impetus to get the econom growth that is project in the  book   for that reason i   m more comfort with a cut of    rather than    basi point right now  i do support presid     s direct of think regard how we talk about thing   at this moment  in a world where ceo and everybodi els are worri about risk  even to impli that the opportun for growth of   or   percent is seen as a risk seem not to be the best choic of word   we might want to find better word to convey our messag in a way that will encourag what we see as the growth necessari to get econom perform up to potenti and to use all of our excess capac and human resourc   i think it   s  e that we look at this and tri to address some of the comment that governor bernank made
mr  chairman  i also support your recommend for a    basi point cut   the reason i support it is the need to address the disinfl risk   in the statement we issu at the last meet we did tell the public for the first  e that we had concern about that risk  and over the intermeet period we valid those concern in such a way as to strengthen the public   s convict that we would act today   have call attent to the risk  i think we are oblig to follow our rhetor with action   as other have said  unchart territori contain risk that we would be wise to avoid  and i think this action will help us avoid those risk
i also support both part of the recommend   it seem to me that  in accord with what we signal in may  an eas is appropri   and consist with what is in the pipelin  particular the fiscal s ulus  a   point move seem appropri   i think we   ve also set a veri high threshold for ourselv in term of our respons to communic  and in my view we ought to look at that question veri care   befor i join the fed and the fomc  i thought as an outsid look in that there was a lot of room for improv in communic   sinc join this group i have come around almost     degre on that  becaus of the intens focus on everi word from the fed  i have becom an incrementalist in term of how we chang the manner in which we communic   so i believ we ought to think veri care about how we do that
mr  chairman  i support your recommend as well as your reason   i   d like to follow up briefli on your answer to presid pool   i wonder if you might give some thought to whether or not it would make sens tactic to say public that we are will to lower the feder fund rate to zero if necessari   i realiz there is some cost to do that  but i see two advantag   first  it might allow us to defer grace for a longer period the issu of what we might do if we run out of room   that is  if the question come up  we could say  well  we   re still     basi point away from that   second  i think it would have a benefici effect on expect in that there would no longer be a feel in the market that we had reach the end of our rope   obvious  we   re go to have to put some thought into that
i agre that the longer we can forestal the threshold of have to move to nontradit mean  the better off we are   as i indic ye day  while i think there are serious problem as we move rate down  money market mutual fund are not a big issu   these are ephemer short term financi intermediari that can come and go veri rapid   there are t ier question  and those question were rais in some of the paper under the propos and discuss of ye day   but i think they  too  are minor relat to the risk we would take in alter our basic procedur   yes  the notion that we have no more room to move rate down may be one of the issu we can address in the humphrey hawkin tes oni without necessarili go too far   at least we can knock down the presumpt of a    basi point limit that a lot of peopl have brought up   i think we could do that without break too much crockeri  if i may put it that way   presid
i agre with your recommend and with governor bernank   s suggest just now
i support your recommend  too   along with bob parri and al broaddus  i certain can see the theori behind get ahead of lower rate of inflat and a high output gap and tri to stem the tide befor the economi actual fall into deflat   but i person think a reduct of    basi point has some advantag   i think it   s a more normal way to oper in an environ where there are some sign of growth   grant  to a larg degre that   s onli a forecast  but thing are look up more than they were the last  e we met  so in view of that environ  i   m veri much in favor of the    basi point   a    basi point move would also tend to moder a bit the degre to which peopl might believ that we are go to be constrain in futur action if we need to take them   i believ it is also more consist with look at disinfl rather than deflat as a concern right now  i would agre with governor bernank that a communic that we   re oper as normal and that we still have     basi point to go is appropri   we need to indic that there   s a lot of s ulus in this environ and that there are sign of a pickup in econom activ   that is the way to handl the situat at this stage  both in term of our action and how we communic our action  final  the task forc approach to communic may be a good way of proceed  but i also thought  given the paper we receiv ye day  that we were go to have an opportun as a group to discuss communic issu   and mayb even befor januari   i find them extraordinarili complex   a discuss somewhat like the one we had ye day would be help to me in set a basi for how to think about these issu   then if we want  we could follow that with a task forc to look at this in more detail and to come up with some recommend   i don   t think we have an immedi  cri need for decis here   at least i hope we don   t   i believ there   s some  e to look at this thought and to move forward in a measur way
that certain should be on the agenda for a futur meet   the major is clear in favor of a    basi point reduct and retain  not exact but in similar word  the balanc of risk assess that we put into the may   statement   would you read the appropri word
the word is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent      with regard to the three sentenc for the press statement      the risk to the committe   s outlook for sustain econom growth over the next sever quarter are balanc   the risk to it outlook for inflat over the next sever quarter are weight toward the downsid   and  taken togeth  the balanc of risk to it object are weight toward the downsid in the forese futur
would you call the roll
chairman  span  governor bernank  governor bie presid broaddus   governor    governor    presid guynn governor kohn   presid    governor olson presid parri  first vice presid stewart             yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes no yes
the member of the feder reserv board will have to discuss the issu of the discount rate   pleas distribut the draft statement to the reserv bank presid  and they can look at it while we adjourn temporarili   we will reconven short   recess
the board of governor has accept the recommend of a number of feder reserv bank to reduc the discount rate to   percent   we accept the request of the boston  new york  st  loui  kansa citi  and san francisco bank   at this point i think we need to give the board member some  e to read the draft press releas
isn   t it call the primari credit rate as oppos to the discount rate
yes  it   s the primari credit rate
we had a request from the folk in our public affair offic to continu refer to it as the discount rate becaus some report have express confus about the new terminolog   so we   ve indic that we would call it the discount rate
well  okay   what about the letter that is be sent to our bank  will that call it someth differ
we send the bank a legal sheet of paper and in that we need to get it right
if the committe has a differ view  the terminolog in the press statement can be chang   in the previous system we had multipl discount rate  we had the adjust program  the season program  and the extend program  but the action taken were adjust to what we term colloqui    the discount rate
it   s the same situat now except that it   s the primari credit rate that we refer to as the discount rate
i assum everyon has had a chanc at this stage to read the statement   is it accept
would you accept one littl suggest
i don   t know    laughter
i would suggest chang the word    sustain    to    suffici
or    accept
you want to take out    sustain    and put in    accept
i would argu against that on the ground that it will rais a lot of question about what that mean in these circumst   i   d leav it alon
yes  i think it   s a word of art in this type of statement  we   ve use it befor  and in the context of what we   ve done  it becom clear
i alway thought we use    sustain    to mean low enough  and we   re talk here about growth not be high enough
no     sustain    mean ani rate of growth for which the intern dynam of that growth has the capabl of continu   now  there are disagr as to where that rate is   but for the purpos of this statement  we   re say that all of the sign plus the addit s ulus would suggest a signific acceler in econom activ   at the moment  howev  we   d be hard press to argu that the data we have seen thus far could be character as self perpetu
mr  chairman  chariman  span   yes
i know you   re tri to strike a balanc between a number of differ view  but when i read the word    unwelcom substanti fall in inflat    they sound more menac  more troubl  and indic of greater concern than i think most of us have   i wonder if there   s a way to take the edg off of that word a bit
i agre with that
are those the same word we use last  e
you want to take the word    substanti    out   is that what you   re argu
yes  we have a differ project now  a much stronger project
well  it is a project
i realiz that
let me put it this way   these are the word we   ve use in the past  and in this environ  the fewer word we chang  the better   in august we can chang the word   it is perfect conceiv to me that  by the  e we get to our august meet  we will be look at an economi that is compar to that in the  book forecast  it   s conceiv that a lot of thing will chang   but i would hope that we could stay with this languag for today   yes  presid parri
in the first sentenc of the second paragraph you list the reason that there is strength   when we talk about it earlier in the meet  we were cite three reason  monetari polici  product  and the s ulus from fiscal polici   the last one is miss from the statement
that   s becaus the fiscal polici hasn   t kick in yet  we   re say that recent sign point to a firm in spend   in other word  it hasn   t happen yet   we   re tri to indic that  as we look at what is go on  we see an economi that is soft and whose growth hasn   t taken on the condit of cumul sustain   but i would certain think that by august we   re go to have to address that question   whi don   t we go with this as is  fill in the appropri name of the reserv bank  and show the dissent  the next meet is august      let me remind you befor we close that dave   would appreci receiv ani chang in your forecast by close of busi on juli     let   s go to lunch  end of meet
