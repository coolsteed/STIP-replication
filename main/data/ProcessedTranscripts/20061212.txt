thank you   dino  some work here at the board suggest that a good portion of the declin in the long term rate in the intermeet period was due to a fall term premium as oppos to expect of inflat   is that consist with what you   ve seen
yes  i think that   s correct
and the reason for a lower term premium
if i could answer that question  i   d be rich by now    laughter   it   s hard to know   i don   t pretend that i can give you a precis answer   certain  the market have been in this benign situat for some  e  and we   ve been struggl with this question for sever   year   whi the term premium has been so low  whi spread have been so low  and whi volatil have been so low for this extend period   i just think that the longer the situat persist  the longer the risk rise   or at least that   s what the worri is   but you all know that
are there other question   presid
dino  you mention last year   s rise in the euro   the soft dollar against the euro and other currenc   is there a decemb effect  and if there is  what caus it
that   s a great question   it has been assert  without proof  that some of the major central bank move into euro veri aggress in decemb        i don   t know whether that   s true  but there is some evid to suggest that it might have been the case and that in somewhat thinner market it had a pronounc effect in decemb  which then got revers in the follow januari or februari   it is hard to know exact whi that would have happen   if dealer see those flow  you will tend to get specul who will follow it or tri to front run it   i can   t say whether that   s happen now  though
thank you  mr  chairman   dino  regard the last graph you show  leverag loan growth  especi in the share held outsid bank  has been happen even though  as you show  high yield bond issuanc realli has been run in a fair normal rang  what is make these loan deal so much more attract to investor
the cynic in me would say that a lot of money has been alloc into the credit space   a lot of money has gone into thing like credit default and credit deriv product   investor want exposur to credit to enhanc yield   they are get that exposur more and more through deriv   you need suppli to feed those structur  and so  as it were    demand to some degre is creat the suppli   that   s one version of event   a second version is that the coven are easier to negoti and somewhat easier in general or less stringent than what you might get in the bond market   third  it might just be cheaper to go out and structur these type of borrow with a small group of lender as oppos to go out and actual market a bond issu
would a natur interpret be that the growth in the credit deriv market in the past few year has made credit exposur via bank    loan sale to other entiti more liquid relat to the liquid that has alway been there in the high yield area
i think that   s probabl anoth factor  which would not be mutual exclus with the other explan   it would just be yet anoth one
i move approv of the manag   s report and oper    laughter
is there ani discuss   are there ani other question for dino   can i get a second
all in favor    chorus of aye    thank you   again  dino  thank you for your mani contribut   we turn now to the staff report on the econom situat   dave
thank you  mr  chairman   as i work my way through a final read of the  book this weekend  i was remind of the old joke about the man who is told by his doctor that he has onli six month to live   the doctor recommend that the man marri an economist and move to north dakota   the man ask whether this will realli help him live ani longer than six month   the doctor say     no  but it sure will feel a lot longer       laughter   part   of the  book was it usual twenti page  but with lengthi discuss of motor vehicl mismeasur  ppi inventori deflat anomali  incom revis  and footnot   on error in     s law  it sure read as though it were a lot longer than twenti page  so  in the kinder spirit of the season  i thought that i would jump straight to the bottom line of this forecast   the bottom line is that our outlook for econom activ has not realli chang much from the one present in the octob  book   or for that matter  the septemb  book   the economi still appear to us to have enter a period of below trend growth that will eventu reliev some of the pressur on resourc util that we believ have develop over the past few year   as in our previous forecast  the current and expect weak in aggreg activ is be led by a steep contract in homebuild   inde  the recent read on hous start and build permit were a littl softer than we had been forecast  and we have mark down our forecast of residenti invest a bit further   we current es  that the drop in residenti invest is take about    percentag point off the annual growth of real gdp in the second half of this year  and we are expect a similar size subtract from growth in the first quarter of next year   we were also surpris to the downsid by the octob read on construct put in place in the nonresidenti sector   as you may recal  we had been expect some slow to becom appar by earli next year as a deceler of busi sale  smaller employ increas  and less rapid growth of equip spend reduc busi    need for space   moreov  while fundament have improv in commerci real estat market in recent year  they are best character as onli moder favor  vacanc rate for offic and industri build are still elev by histor standard  and rental incom has been rise at onli a tepid rate  all told  we have interpret the softer read of the past coupl of month as suggest that the slowdown in nonresidenti construct has arriv a bit sooner than expect  but we don   t see an outright slump as the most like outcom in this sector   busi spend on equip has unfold pretti much as we had expect  the report on durabl good order was wide read by other as surpris weak  in part  that weak result from a    percent drop in order and shipment of comput that we are extrem skeptic about and that the bea will signific downweight in es  invest spend   among the piec that actual matter for gaug capit outlay  the report was close to our forecast   we have been expect some slow in real spend for equip and softwar in the current quarter  and it look as though that is what we are get   but with order backlog still ampl  corpor balanc sheet flush with cash  and the cost of capit low  we continu to anticip modest gain in equip spend in the near term   meanwhil  the consum appear to be chug along   our forecast for   percent growth in real consum spend in the current quarter is unchang from the octob  book and close to the averag pace of the past few year   steadi gain in employ and incom  the drop in energi price that has occur sinc   the summer  and higher stock price appear  at least to date  to have offset ani restraint come from higher borrow cost and deceler hous price   we have had a few upsid surpris as well   in particular  govern spend  at both the feder and the state and local level  has been somewhat stronger in the second half than anticip in our octob forecast   also  as   will be discuss short  net export are expect to make a slight larger contribut to current quarter growth of real gdp   on net  we read these data as suggest that growth in aggreg output in the second half of this year has been slight weaker than in our previous project  larg on account of the softer construct figur   that   s not easi to see in our top line forecast of real gdp becaus of some serious problem with the bea   s measur of motor vehicl output   as you know  we simpli don   t believ the bea   s es  that motor vehicl output ad   percentag point to the growth of real gdp in the third quarter  in light of the fact that vehicl assembl fell         unit at an annual rate   by our es   the bea   s faulti methodolog caus the growth of real gdp to be overst about   percentag point in the third quarter   we expect that the unwind of some of that glitch in the fourth quarter will trim real gdp growth about    percentag point   so  we believ that  on net  the publish growth of real gdp will be overst about   percentag point in the second half of this year   adjust for the measur problem  we es  that real gdp probabl rose at an annual rate of     percent in the second half  about   percentag point less than in our previous forecast and notic below our es  of the growth of potenti   our view that there has been a percept slow in the pace of activ has receiv some independ support from our measur of industri product  factori output increas at an annual rate of about   percent over the first half of the year but seem like to increas at rough half that pace in the second half   the cutback in auto product and construct  in addit to their direct effect on aggreg output  are leav an imprint on the product in upstream industri  even beyond these two area  industri activ appear to have weaken some of late   the recent slow in ip has occur amid sign of some backup of inventori  wherea a few month ago ani problem seem to be confin larg to the motor vehicl sector  there are now more widespread sign of unwant inventori accumul   most notabl for steel  fabric metal  miner product  wood  paper  and plastic   the impress left by the hard data is reinforc by purchas manag  more of whom report that their custom    inventori are too high than was the case a few month ago   our forecast envis that a relat brief period of soft manufactur output will be suffici to clean up these problem   but we will need to monitor this area close in come month becaus what appear relat benign today could turn worrisom in a hurri   for now  we are reason comfort that the data on both spend and product are more consist with   aggreg activ run modest below the pace of it potenti than with a more serious slowdown   moreov  it would be a mistak to focus onli on the downsid risk becaus there are some promin upsid risk to our forecast as well   to my mind  the perform of the labor market continu to provid the clearest challeng to our view that the growth of activ has slip below it potenti   to be sure  last friday   s labor market report came in veri close to the project in the decemb  book   but the last two labor market report taken togeth were stronger than we were expect back in octob   payrol employ gain have slow from the more rapid rate seen over the past few year  but onli to a pace consist with someth close to trend growth in output   not the below trend pace that we es  has prevail over the second half of this year   moreov  the unemploy rate has declin about   percentag point in recent month  an outcom more consist with abov trend growth than with below trend growth   our forecast assum that sign of greater weak in labor demand will becom more appar in the month immedi ahead  with increas in privat payrol slow to about        per month in the first quarter and the unemploy rate return to    percent   the recent modest backup in initi claim give some support to this expect   but slow in labor demand is  for now  just a forecast   we consid anoth possibl interpret of recent labor market develop  which is that  despit the downward adjust that we have made to our es  of the growth of structur product and potenti output  we remain too op ist in our outlook   the unemploy rate has been move lower despit growth in real gdp that we es  to have been below   percent   we have been surpris again by the weak in labor product   we have not bought into this interpret larg becaus the tension between the labor market signal and gdp are relat recent and are not especi larg   so we are inclin to gather a bit more evid befor make ani further adjust to the suppli side of our forecast   but the recent read do point to a bit more downsid risk than upsid risk to our es  of structur labor product and potenti output   move beyond near term develop  we continu to expect that the period of below trend growth will extend through the middl of next year   as in our previous forecast  the weak in activ is led by larg ongo declin in residenti invest   moreov  we are expect the deceler in home price to weigh on the growth of consumpt next year through the typic wealth channel   with final sale and output slow  the usual acceler effect put some brake on outlay for consum durabl and busi invest spend   those influenc are reinforc in this forecast by a modest back up of long term interest rate  as financi market particip come to realiz that monetari polici will not be eas on the  et that they current envis     we see forc at work that  by the middl of next year  should result in a gradual reacceler of activ back to a pace in line with the growth of the economi   s potenti   import  we are expect some lessen of the contract in residenti invest   hous start have now fallen by enough that  if home sale stabil at someth around their recent pace   and i recogn that this is a big if   homebuild will be abl to make substanti headway in clear the backlog of unsold home   as they do  we expect construct activ to level off in the second half of      and then to stage a mild upturn in        anoth factor work in the direct of some acceler in activ is a diminish drag on spend and activ from the earlier run up in oil price   by our es   the rise in oil price has held down growth in real gdp by about   percentag point this year but should be a rough neutral factor for growth in      and        on balanc  our forecast is ident to that in the octob  book  with the growth of real gdp project to be    percent in      and     percent in       there were  howev  a few modest offset influenc   a stronger stock market and a lower foreign exchang valu of the dollar would  all els be equal  have result in a somewhat stronger project for real activ   but those effect were counterbalanc by the substanti downward revis that the bea made to it es  of labor compens in the second and third quarter   as you know  we had been expect about half of the first quarter surg in labor compens to be revers in subsequ quarter   but in the event  it was complet revers  leav the level of real incom about     billion below our previous forecast   in respons  we lower our consumpt project  just as we had rais it earlier when incom had been revis up   on balanc  the effect of the lower incom offset the influenc of a stronger stock market and lower dollar  and our gdp project was left unchang   like our forecast for real activ  our forecast for inflat also has chang littl over the past seven week   as we had anticip  this autumn   s drop in consum energi price has result in outright declin in headlin consum price   core consum price came in close to expect as well   though the core cpi was bit below our forecast and the core pce a bit abov   i wouldn   t make much of either surpris   our miss on the cpi was concentr in apparel  use car  and lodg away from home   all compon character by low signal to nois ratio   core pce came in onli a coupl of basi point abov our forecast  with the surpris here most in the nonmarket compon of medic care cost  specif the bea   s es  of medicar hospit reimburs rate   all in all  pretti small potato   our longer term outlook for inflat also remain unchang   the slight tighter labor market incorpor in this project  along with the lower dollar and higher attend import price  would have led us to mark up a bit our inflat project   but the downward revis to labor compens impli smaller gain in labor cost and a notic higher level of the price markup  suggest a littl less prospect upward pressur on price   as in our past forecast  we expect a gradual slow in core consum price over the next two year as the pass through   of higher price for energi and other commod run it cours and as the current tight in labor and product market diminish and a small gap in resourc util eventu open up   both the cpi and pce measur of core price are current run a bit below the pace of this past spring   by enough to encourag us in our view that core inflat is more like to fall than to rise over the next two year but not by near enough to cinch the case for our posit   i have so much more to say  but i   d better stop here  or you will think that we   ve begun our honeymoon togeth in north dakota     kamin will continu our present
a few month ago  when    son ask me to fill in for her at the decemb fomc meet  i immedi wrote to santa claus and ask  as my present  for some major intern event to take place  be it an emerg market crisi  skyrocket commod price  or a spectacular collaps of the dollar  such develop are not alway welcom by financi market particip or by ordinari work peopl  but they certain make for interest convers   laughter   well  if you believ what you read in the financi press  santa grant me my third wish   as dino has discuss  sinc you last met  the dollar is down about   percent against the euro and     percent against  l   two week ago  the economist saw fit to put on it cover a pictur of a dollar bill with georg washington   s jaw drop   to put these recent develop in perspect  howev  the dollar declin consider less against the currenc of most of our other major trade partner  and the broad dollar has fallen onli about   percent over the intermeet period  this is still a signific declin for so short a period  but is onli half the size of the drop post between the march and may fomc meet earlier this year   also  we have seen noth to indic that a major rebalanc of investor portfolio away from the  back is immin   accord  as is our practic  in our forecast we have adjust down the start point for the project path of the dollar but continu to project onli a modest declin in it real valu go forward   even befor the dollar   s recent declin  we were see some limit evid of improv in the u s  extern balanc   a few week after your octob meet  we receiv data indic that the month nomin trade deficit had shrunk from a record     billion in august to     billion in septemb   although this downshift princip reflect declin in the price of import oil  the trade deficit had been boost by rise oil price earlier this year  and their subsequ fall and stabil at least should diminish one factor widen the deficit go forward   this morn  octob trade data were releas  they indic that the trade deficit shrank a bit further  to about     billion   this deficit was even smaller than we   d anticip  with export a bit stronger and import a bit weaker   the recent perform of real net export also appear a littl more posit  the septemb trade data and other recent inform point to somewhat weaker   than expect real import growth in the third quarter and near flat real import in the current quarter  this flatten is due in part to a sharp declin in the volum of oil import as domest user work off an unusu high level of inventori   with real export es  to have continu expand solid  the decemb  book show real net export in the third and fourth quarter combin ad slight to u s  gdp growth in comparison with the slight drag we wrote down in octob   this morn   s octob trade releas suggest that we   ll probabl revis that contribut up a littl further   over the next two year  real import growth should pick up as u s  activ acceler and oil import stabil   with export growth hold steadi  support by the ongo expans abroad and the declin dollar  real net export start deterior again and subtract about     percentag point from gdp growth in      and      percentag point in        this drag is quit small  howev  compar with the near     percentag point drag exert by net export on averag from      through        it is also about     percentag point smaller than in the octob  book  and we would attribut this princip to the weaker dollar    consist with the improv perform of net export  the weaker dollar has also led us to project slight stronger trade and current account balanc   the current account deficit now expand just a touch  from about    percent of gdp at present to   percent by the end of       wherea the trade deficit remain about flat as a share of gdp   at around     percent   over the forecast period     this flatten out suggest that sustain of the u s  extern balanc is just around the corner   absolut not    laughter   the trade deficit is still project to widen a bit in nomin  dollar valu term   as long as the trade balanc remain substanti in deficit  borrow to financ that deficit ul  will lead to grow extern debt  rise payment on that debt  and ever larger current account deficit   our project has the net intern invest posit  which was negat    percent of gdp in       slide to negat    percent of gdp by        the slower deterior of u s  extern balanc that we anticip depend on continu solid econom growth among our trade partner   our trade weight aggreg of foreign real gdp growth clock in at about     percent in the first half of this year  which like was a littl fa  than it trend rate   the data we   ve receiv sinc the octob  book reinforc our view that a stepdown is in train  with growth in china  mexico  japan  and the euro area all slow in the third quarter from previous unusu elev rate   we es  that  all told  the foreign economi deceler to a pace of    percent in the second half of this year  and we see it stay at this more sustain rate go forward   can foreign growth remain this strong  even as u s  gdp growth is project to averag less than     percent over the forecast period   u s  growth and foreign growth are high correl  reflect both direct trade link and indirect link through financi market and confid effect   howev  growth rate here and abroad do not move in lockstep   over the past thirti year  gap in excess of   to     percentag point have period open up between u s  and foreign growth  at about   percentag point  the growth differenti we are project is not unusu   of cours  were the unit state to fall into recess  this would like be bad news for our trade partner   sinc       five recess have been date for the u s  economi  and on all those occas foreign growth slump as well   as we put togeth our outlook  we also had to consid whether it would take a sharper slowdown than we are project to prevent widespread inflationari pressur   we are hearten to see that  as in the unit state  the declin in oil price sinc august has led to sharp declin in headlin cpi inflat in mani of our trade partner   for exampl  euro area twelv month inflat has fallen through the ecb   s   percent target ceil to onli     percent  while canadian inflat has fallen to   percent   howev  inflat abroad should pick up again with project increas in oil price   moreov  resourc util abroad has been rise  and it is difficult to identifi much slack in the major foreign economi   to date  measur of core inflat and wage growth are not signal signific upward pressur  but unemploy rate are general near low last reach at the end of the     s   the emerg of more pronounc inflationari pressur  should that occur  would like trigger a more substanti further tighten of monetari polici and financi condit than we are current anticip  lead to a falloff from the steadi foreign growth call for in the  book forecast   this  in turn  could put the u s  trade and current account balanc on a more negat trajectori than we now expect  that conclud my remark
thank you   are there question for our colleagu  presid
i have a question for dave on the first paragraph of the  book  where you said that labor market have been stronger than we were expect   of cours  just now you also talk about that and about the employ report on friday   then you said     in construct our forecast of aggreg activ  we   ve given greater weight to the data on spend and industri product      i was just wonder whi you decid to do that   you point to the labor market as an upsid risk  but i was wonder whi you decid to give greater weight to the spend and industri product data
i guess our basic feel was that  if just the spend data had been weak  we would have probabl had greater paus about downweight the strength of the labor market segment   but we   ve also seen a weak in industri product  which is in physic product data as well   then there   s consider nois in labor product  and the unemploy rate is typic a lag indic   so we thought that for now we would give more weight to the spend data as provid a signal that we probabl have enter a period of below trend growth than to the signal given by the labor market  which as i indic in my brief could be read as at trend or mayb abov trend   we   re look for labor market to be a bit of a lag indic this  e around   we   re anticip some slow in labor demand go forward and some bounceback in the unemploy rate   but i want to make clear in my brief that  although we didn   t dismiss the labor market  we did downweight it  and if our forecast is go to turn out to be right  we will have to see some slow in labor market relat soon to confirm the basic stori
otherwis  you chang the forecast
it   s a legi  possibl that we   ve just made the wrong call on gdp growth   mayb we   ll look back through a seri of data revis and mayb a strong fourth quarter or first quarter and will averag through this and say     in this period  growth realli didn   t slow to the     percent pace that we thought was there      you may look back and say     gee  you should have given more weight to the labor market    it was give you the better signal      in recent year  the labor market has not been as reliabl a predictor of gdp growth as it was from the mid     s to the mid     s  when we could  in fact  use the labor market indic and forecast gdp better than the advanc es  of the gdp that the bea put out  that relationship has been broken down from the mid     s to now  when there has just been so   much more movement on the suppli side of the economi and in product that it has been more difficult to use the labor market to project   that   s one reason that we have lean in the direct of the product and spend data
thank you   presid pool
dave  if interest rate had held at the june level more or less  what might have been the effect on hous start and the economi more general   i realiz in one sens that   s an inadmiss question becaus you have to ask what make an endogen variabl differ from what it otherwis would have been  but suppos it had to do with the term premium or market expect or someth
rough speak  if we had been held back at the june level  we would es  that hous start probabl would have been about         unit weaker than they current are   run that through the model suggest rough     percent on the level of gdp  whether all that would have play out by now is not entir clear   in term of broader econom consequ  one thing that we show in an altern simul in the  book was  if this unusu low term premium turn quick and we get a rise of anoth    basi point there accompani by some weak in the stock market and some endogen respons on credit spread  the effect would be pretti power   it result in a forecast of an unemploy rate rise to     percent  even with your eas of monetari polici  accord to the es  taylor rule  down to   percent for the fed fund rate   i think that those kind of movement in long term interest rate work power effect on our overal econom outlook
dave  the two measur of labor compens that we typic look at   compens per hour and the employ cost index   over a long period track each other   fair close  but in the shorter run there   s more varianc   even though we   ve seen the recent downward revis to compens per hour  it   s still run higher than the eci   i was wonder how you have approach weigh these two seri in your assess of the labor market and also how your outlook for inflat would chang if you put more weight on the eci  which is lower than compens per hour
to answer the latter question   if we realli threw away the inform in the nonfarm busi compens that is taken from the nation incom account and focus sole on the eci  we   d have a lower inflat forecast   in our overal price inflat project  we use a varieti of model   i talk about this a littl earlier in the year when we got that big upward surpris   we have some model that just say     don   t pay ani attent to the labor market data  they   re all so bad and they have so littl predict content for price that you   re better off just circumv them altogeth      now  we have never felt comfort that the right thing to do was to give zero weight to the labor market side of thing  so in the project we have look at some of the model that incorpor those effect and use the eci in some model and compens per hour in other   again  if you went total with the nonfarm busi compens per hour in those model  you   d probabl be at or mayb slight abov our current forecast   so i think there   s a lot of uncertainti here  one of the thing that we want to signal was that there are huge amount of uncertainti about what the nairu and potenti output are   we show a simul with a lower nairu   in construct our forecast  we have to take a stand becaus we have to show you a forecast that is move an economi back toward equilibrium   sit in your chair  howev  you would obvious want to view this from a risk manag perspect and understand that our abil to be veri precis there is quit weak   the recent compens data put back on the tabl the possibl that   we   re get a signal from the labor market that not as much pressur is come from the labor cost side as we had earlier thought
thank you  mr  chairman   i have two question that are sort of relat  the first question has to do with the acceler in core pce price that we saw earlier this year and were all obvious veri concern about   one rational we   ve offer in tri to understand that acceler was the pass through effect from the previous year   s rise in energi price from about     a barrel to someth like     a barrel   given that energi price have now fallen and it look as though they   re stabil around     a barrel at least for now  how do you measur the effect on the pass through into core pce price from that rough    percent drop in oil price   i can see the measur go on in the headlin  but as i look at your forecast of core  they haven   t respond to that same effect   is there much pass through in the model to core pce price from energi price  or is there not   i   m tri to understand how you guy think about that  the second question is relat to inflat as well   in tri to understand this automobil thing   which i clear do not entir understand at this point   i saw your suggest that an appar anomal larg drop occur in the ppi for truck or someth like that   was that real or accur   are there ani ramif from that anomal drop in the ppi     that measur problem carri over to other price index   for exampl  the cpi   if it   carri over    that mean that our es  of the cpi are perhap underst in the near term becaus of the same measur problem   i don   t know whether or not there   s ani relat between those two   those are my two question
if i can answer that last question first   there isn   t ani consequ for the cpi   they actual measur motor vehicl differ in the ppi and the cpi   in the ppi  when they get to octob  they start measur the price of just the      model year  wherea in the cpi they are tri to phase in new model as peopl are actual buy them   the problem with the ppi that we discov was that general motor has two veri popular truck line and appar did not actual introduc a      model for these truck but label them         classic       laughter  they discount those heavili becaus they were anticip that they would  in fact  introduc the      model short   the statistician at the bls saw those      classic model  saw them as      model  and said     gee  they   ve introduc a new model  and the price is drop      so  on a season adjust basi  the price realli fell a lot   that just isn   t right  and fortun it  sn   t contamin anyth beyond the ppi and it consequ
that was realli my question   whether it contamin anyth els
on the first question   we think the slowdown in energi price  the flatten out of energi price  the actual declin of energi price is probabl go to be worth about   percentag point of deceler in core price go forward
that  sn   t show up in your forecast
well  it is in the forecast   it   s just not so easi to see on a revis by revis basi becaus we   re also be surpris by the tight of the overal labor market  by the declin of the dollar  and by somewhat higher import price   so there have been other offset factor that are mask the under effect of the lower energi price   we have built in those energi price on the upsid  we   re take them out on the downsid  and they are  i think  an import factor behind the contour that we   re project   it   s just that there are other factor oper
i was look at the chang from the august forecast of core inflat  which was befor we had the big declin  and it realli hasn   t chang much   that   s whi i couldn   t see whi it hadn   t had that much of an effect
with all the problem that labor indic provid us  one strike thing in the recent report is that the servic sector is what pull the fat out of the fire   if my memori is correct     percent of our employ is now in the servic sector  over    percent of our output  and perhap a greater percentag of valu ad   if you look at the number  there are  for exampl  more health care worker than manufactur worker   there are perhap as mani in the entertain restaur sector as in the manufactur sector   so here   s the question   have we been abl to identifi ani servic sector subsector that can be use as indic of turn point in the busi cycl  as we often point to auto and durabl good   as we move up the valu ad ladder through the servic sector driven economi  the number are so big   it   concern me that we constant refer to the old cyclic indic  which are no doubt veri import  but i   m wonder if we have been abl to identifi some subsector in the servic area that indic turn point in the busi cycl
i don   t know of ani particular research that bear exact on that question about whether or not we can identifi cyclic servic industri   for the most part  your basic point is well taken  which is that the servic sector is larger  more stabl  less interest sensit  less prone to the kind of inventori backup and consequ signific product cut and cyclic behavior than the manufactur and construct sector   obvious the size of those two sector has evolv  and it   s conceiv that the economi itself will becom less cyclic  but we   d still be think that if you   re worri about cyclic turn point  the first place that you are like to see   them is in the durabl good and manufactur and construct area   i think a reason research topic would ask whether or not the economi is chang in way that one could find cyclic behavior in the servic employ side of thing  and i just don   t know what the answer to that is
could i ask just a quick second question  which is total differ   i think i read a statement that we were get diminish return on the previous tighten initi we took  but i may have read that incorrect   is that correct   now that we have a sens of the lag that we talk about befor   are we run the cours of our previous tighten measur  which are have less effect on the economi
i don   t think you read that in anyth that we wrote    laughter  that   s not the way that we would be think about thing   that somehow that there are diminish return to the potenc of monetari polici
so they are still have effect   thank you
we   re tri to decompos chang in forward nomin interest rate and figur out what are risk premium  term premium  real rate  and so forth   have you look at what   s happen global with the same basic object and tri to decompos chang in forward rate or real rate outsid the unit state into their various compon
there has been some work on that   it look as though in a coupl of foreign industri countri that there is some evid of declin in term premium   it   s veri difficult to determin whi those term premium have been fall or  more general  whi long term bond yield in the foreign countri have been go down recent with those in the unit state   part of that is like due to the fact that global financi market are extrem well integr  so when   u s  yield move  foreign yield have a tendenc to move as well  along with the kind of chang in exchang rate you might expect
are there other question   if not  we   re readi for our econom go round   as alway  two hand intervent are avail   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i have to admit that this  e around i found it pretti challeng to read the tea leav on econom activ   the data are provid distinct contradictori signal   for exampl  sever key indic of aggreg spend have come in below expect  and the  book now see real gdp growth this quarter and the next averag a mere     percent   at the same  e  the labor market continu to be strong and show no clear sign of weaken  as evidenc by the novemb employ report   the latest inform on inflat has been fair favor  but even with some sign of eas  the under trend in core consum price inflat remain abov my comfort zone  the last  e we met i describ the situat as a bimod economi with strength in most sector and weak limit to just two sector  hous and domest auto product   this descript by and larg remain apt   the correct in the hous sector has continu  even sharpen somewhat compar with our expect   still  there are some encourag sign that the demand for hous may be stabil  probabl assist by recent declin in mortgag rate  after a precipit fall  home sale appear to have level off   in addit  equiti valuat for homebuild have continu to rise in the past coupl of month  suggest that the outlook for these busi may be improv   final  the gap between hous price and fundament may not be as larg as some calcul suggest becaus real long term interest rate have fallen quit a bit recent  rais the fundament valu of hous   that said  the hous sector on balanc is a   sourc of downsid risk  and the risk could be magnifi if mortgag rate were to rise again as foreseen by the  book  outsid residenti invest  gdp growth has remain solid   consumpt has continu to be strong  inde  i think there are upsid risk to consum spend  given the  book   s forecast of a signific rise in the save rate   but recent indic of nonresidenti invest and activ in the manufactur sector have come in below expect   the key question is whether these data hint at a crack in the economi   s armor that could widen   it   s obvious too earli to tell  but these weak bear care monitor  overal  the data on spend paint a clear pictur of an economi grow well below trend  but it seem as though the bea hasn   t deliv this messag to the bls    laughter   the veri latest data show payrol employ grow steadili   the household data are even more alarm  the unemploy rate has declin    percentag point over the past year and now stand at     percent     percentag point below our es  of the nairu   my busi contact tell me the same thing   labor market are tight  and job are hard to fill  especi for skill posit   but some other indic suggest that labor market may have soften a bit   in particular  the confer board index of job market percept  base on a survey of household  declin in both octob and novemb   this index is histor veri high correl with the unemploy rate  but now it   s send a differ signal  suggest that labor market are rough in balanc   similar  in novemb fewer firm report open that are hard to fill  the fall in the unemploy rate this year is hard to squar with     s law   over the past four quarter  gdp growth has averag   percent  just     abov the board   s es  of potenti gdp growth   a standard     s law calcul suggest that this should have led to a declin in the unemploy rate of onli about     percentag point   in fact  howev  it declin       percentag point   of cours  labor market do adjust with a lag  so we may just need to be patient and wait for     s law to reassert itself as assum in the  book forecast   an altern possibl is that the output gap is more posit than assum in the  book becaus of lower growth in potenti output or more rapid growth in actual output   in his present    note the possibl that the growth rate of potenti output may be lower than even the downward revis es  in the  book   it is also possibl   and  in fact  there are indic   that actual output growth may have been fa  than the pace reflect in measur gdp   growth in domest incom has outpac gdp growth by   percentag point over the past year   now i know that when someon mention the statist discrep  eye start to glaze over  but i rais this issu becaus it could have import implic for the outlook   if the gross domest incom measur end up be more accur  then the declin in the unemploy rate this year would not be surpris   go forward  more rapid output growth would impli a lower path for unemploy  potenti ad to inflat pressur  turn to inflat itself  the news has been pretti good on balanc sinc our last meet  we expect core pce price inflat to edg down from just under     percent this year to about   percent in        we came to this forecast balanc two main piec of news   on the one hand  recent labor market data point to a lower path for the unemploy rate than befor  and all els be equal  this boost our inflat forecast a bit   offset this effect  on the other hand  is the huge downward revis in compens per hour   when these data came out  i let out a big sigh of relief   the revis data are more consist with the indic we were get from the employ cost index and suggest that wage growth has remain contain   in contrast  my contact report intensifi wage pressur  result in part from more frequent employe quit and outsid offer   even so  my contact do not report that these develop are exert   signific pressur on their profit margin or price  suggest continu strong product growth   but that  in turn  conflict with the data on product growth in the nonfarm busi sector  which have been weak  not strong   output per hour in the nonfarm busi sector increas onli about     percent over the past year  well below it trend   but there is reason to believ that this declin may overst the slow in product growth  given continu strong growth in product in the nonfinanci corpor sector   at least part of this discrep between nonfinanci corpor and nonfarm product growth reflect the gap i mention befor between gross domest incom and gross domest product   if the gdi number are  in fact  more accur  that alon could add near   percentag point to nonfarm busi product growth  perhap reconcil the report by my contact of intensifi wage pressur along with an absenc of pressur on price and margin  in summari  i continu to view a soft land with moder inflat as my best guess forecast  condit on maintain the current stanc of polici   but there are sizabl risk on both side to the outlook for growth  and the downsid risk are now more palpabl   there is  likewis  a great deal of uncertainti about inflat go forward  in this case  the risk remain bias to the high side
presid    did i understand you to say that the gdi be higher than the gdp increas both actual output and potenti output and so should be read as most a neutral distinct
i read that as suggest that the growth of actual output might be underst   i suppos one could also contempl the possibl that potenti might be underst but i was hypothes that actual output is underst  and henc the gap between actual and potenti may be larger than the  book assum
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   busi activ in the seventh district appear to be expand at a slight slower pace than the last  e we met   but most of my contact were still posit about the outlook  and when we put togeth our forecast for the nation economi  we did not make ani larg chang to the project of either growth or inflat   we see output recov as we move into       and core pce stay near it current rate through the forecast period  as   discuss  we   ve talk about the bimod natur of the nation economi  hous is weak  and the auto sector is struggl  but the rest of the economi is perform well  we see these sector differ  particular with regard to auto  in our district economi  michigan   s unemploy rate is about   percent  and it was the onli state to show a year over year declin in the ofheo hous price measur   in contrast  illinoi and wisconsin have a more diversifi manufactur base  and they   re do well   furthermor  we continu to hear report of growth in demand for manufactur good outsid of auto and residenti construct   one exampl of this is caterpillar   they expect revenu from highway construct and mine equip to remain strong with some eas in the u s  market be offset by increas demand from abroad   manufactur of machin tool continu to report solid order   of cours  such report contrast sharpli with our convers with the big three automobil maker   general motor indic that they expect       to be anoth challeng year   incent are one issu   gm think that their own incent are now about the right level  includ the classic   laughter  wherea other are still high   anoth issu is that the uaw contract will be come up for renew next year in septemb  and the negoti are expect to be difficult    turn to labor market more general  kelli and manpow said that the overal nationwid placement of temporari worker were unchang year over year  but placement of light industri product worker continu to increas  and convers from temporari to perman remain strong   moreov  their client  while cautious  general do not expect ani prolong period of weak   these temp firm said that wage pressur were steadi to down a bit  but a major nation specialti retail indic that he was have difficulti hire holiday worker and perman worker and that he was plan for an increas of    to    percent in wage for entri level full  e hire   retail also told us that they believ strong labor market were support spend  and they were look forward to good result for the holiday season  with regard to inflat  even though energi price have move off their peak  there were few sign of rollback in fuel surcharg   inde  we even heard of further cost pass through from petroleum base input   howev  we did not get the sens that general cost pressur were intensifi  final  we held our annual econom outlook symposium ten day ago in the midst of the first major snowstorm of the year   the three dozen hardi forecast predict real gdp growth of     percent in       and the employ rate to drift up to     percent by the second half of the year  they also forecast that total cpi would increas     percent and that sale of light vehicl would be      million unit  turn to the nation outlook  the data have come in somewhat softer than i expect at our last meet   our uncertainti about the outlook has increas somewhat  but i still think that there are signific forc support activ and that the economi will return to a better growth path as we move into next year   to be sure  residenti construct is quit weak  auto sale are softer  and the busi suppli these industri are experienc some sizabl reduct in   demand   howev  i do not get the sens of a secondari spillov to other sector of the economi  import  the labor market has remain robust  support household spend   as we   ve talk about   busi confid appear to be hold up fair well   inde  i   m impress by the lack of pessim among my contact  even those who are experienc flatten sale or sluggish sale   final  real interest rate are low across the matur spectrum  and risk spread remain narrow   given the liquid in the system  it   s still hard to see current financi condit as be that restrict  in the end  we did not make ani larg chang to the overal contour of our gdp forecast  we still see the economi grow moder below potenti in       and increas at a pace moder abov potenti in        now  we condit our baselin forecast on market expect for interest rate   accord  this outlook is boost by the expect declin in the fund rate that   s in the market   if  like the  book  we had assum a flat feder fund rate path  we would project a recoveri onli to potenti in        turn to inflat  the recent data have not clarifi the trend   the six month chang in the core pce price index is down  but the three month number have move up   in chicago  we like to use indic model  like the one that stock and watson develop  as a way to assess the implic of incom data for futur inflat   these are  e seri model  and they forecast inflat base on more than    econom indic link to inflationari pressur   the project of these model have chang littl sinc our last meet   our forecast continu to show inflat run too high for my tast   even our most op ist model  which are es  use data onli sinc       have core pce inflat flat at     percent through        in sum  i am still concern that inflat will be too high for too long  and even though the downsid risk to growth have increas  i continu to see inflat as the predomin risk
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  at the last meet i provid anecdot evid  as i alway do after my survey of ceo and cfos  of a slowdown for some sector   i spoke of hous  which i   ve been a bit more concern about to date than even our model have indic   i refer to slow truck activ for the christma season  and i report that the book to bill ratio for semiconductor  although that is high volatil  slip below   for the first  e in quit some  e   i also cite the aggress consum product advertis as we approach year end  which is occur rather earli   i conclud that  in net those report against the activ of the rail  the ship compani  and other servic sector activ  growth in the third quarter seem to have proceed at a pace slight north of   percent  or at least at a run rate about in that region   then inflat measur by the trim mean  which as you know is how we like to look at thing at the dalla feder reserv bank  though dip in septemb was still hover in the high  s as measur over the three month and twelv month interv   i express that  go forward  the balanc seem to be skew more toward the inflat side than toward substandard growth  i would agre with presid   and presid    if i heard them correct  that basic the tail have gotten a littl fatter   that is  we   re concern that there might be slight less growth  but at the same  e we still have concern about inflat   so i   d like to address the two veri briefli   on the inflat front  in octob the trim mean bounc back to     percent from the     percent that we had in septemb  driven upward  as   mention  by acceler medic care price and a pickup in owner    equival rent  although that was somewhat slight  the median pce inflat rate was   percent   of concern to me is that  although the percentag of good with rise price fell  the percentag with more rapid increas rose and compon with a   rise of over   percent have gone from    percent to    percent of the compon measur overal in octob  with regard to econom activ  i think there are some continu negat and some posit   i   d like to pick up on the negat that i mention at the last meet   the airlin that i discuss are report even more aggress discount   one of my contact  who i think is the longest serv and most success ceo in the airlin industri  said this is the most aggress discount that he rememb   of cours  we   ve all seen wal mart   s number   there is difficulti in sort through what is of their own make in term of their brand and what is the overal slowdown in activ   but the trucker to whom i have been talk are still not notic the pickup in the christma activ that they expect  mr  chairman   other retail  too  are report some soft   there is some discuss of whether or not it make a differ that we have one extra day in the retail season for christma this year   the thanksgiv surg that they expect in sale clear did not occur in almost everi categori of incom except for the veri highest   the semiconductor produc are report a    grim    outlook in term of their book to bill ratio and what they   re sell forward   i have just one other comment on energi   perhap the largest oper for the opec countri point out that they have realiz    percent of their announc cut   that   s a typic ratio   al naimi  who is the minist of petroleum and miner resourc of saudi arabia  is press for anoth million barrel cut  presum to bring the total cut up to the     million barrel that were be target   so the negat seem to still be in place  as far as the posit are concern  at least at the margin  i   d like to report on a few of them   one is that conveni store oper are report a littl turn up in volum and final see the effect of lower gas price at the pump  and retail in the past week have notic a slight pickup from what they were report at the end of the novemb holiday season   with regard to   hous  as you know  i speak to two of the five largest builder  and i   ve ad a third to that sampl      they are report what they call a sens of a turn  but this may be their perpetu op    but cancel rate have improv from    percent to    percent accord to the report  and actual in novemb there was a gross pickup in unit sale of about   percent accord to these report   so they are feel that some pent up demand is build   the interest thing about that industri in particular is that they are all walk away from their option  one of the largest said that they expect to end up with onli    percent of their land option  and yet land price have not yet fallen   so i think that   s the next shoe that will like drop  other than hous  in survey the twenti six ceo and three cfos to whom i speak  i hear no report of consum or client payment problem or lag payment  which is often an indic  on a serial basi  that there is weak ensu   again  go back to one of my favorit indic  which is a larg express shipper  my contact said     i don   t feel ani real chang from what we saw in the last four to five month      that larg express shipper is look at gdp growth of about   percent or slight north of   percent   also  i like to look at restaur becaus they employ perhap up to    million peopl  so it   s not an unimport sector   for the twenti five compani in the casual dine sector  sale have declin   at the same  e  their guest count has gone down even further  which indic what we expect befor   if you   ll forgiv the pun   a move down the food chain from restaur like chili   s to mcdonald   s and so on   this is what you would expect in term of continu tight  and yet they are begin to sens a slight turn becaus gas price at the pump may be kick in  final  i want to touch on some negat disguis as posit   the first is the readi avail of capit   i think dino was veri good in his present this morn  as he alway is  one ceo of a compani in the servic sector  larg in the entertain busi    not see   much slow take place   he said that the avail of capit is like    dog drop in central park      no matter where you step  capit is readili avail   to an old pension fund manag like me that indic a potenti trip wire  which is what dino said   so i think risk is certain there  anoth negat disguis as a posit would be the robust activ we   re still see in the energi sector  although i would summar it by say that the foot has been taken off the acceler   we haven   t stop   there   s a bit less rig count in the mix  and yet there   s still a great deal of construct activ  as we find that the petrochem are improv their refin capac and meet modern standard  and there are huge number of coal gasif project  not just in texa util but also elsewher in the countri  mr  chairman  the labor shortag in the gulf   the golden coast  as we call it   is signific   one oil compani alon es  that  for petrochem purpos  they are at least        worker short   the mayor of texa citi  which has the highest concentr of petrochem plant in the countri in his district  call a meet of all the labor union last month   the mayor  who sit on our board  said that the union report that they cannot find worker  if txu proceed with the coal gasif plant  they   re look at   million manhour per project  and they have ten project on the board  assum that they   re approv   the point is that we do still see a signific shortag of skill and semi skill labor   so as you depart for china  mr  chairman  have spoken about the two fat tail  i would urg you to be care of ani fu dog with two tail    laughter
on that note  presid      laughter

 e to let down our guard on this front with labor market fair tight  the unemploy rate at     percent  and most of the downward effect of declin energi price behind us   we could see inflat move sideway rather than down  and that could well be an issu   market see us   begin to eas as soon as the late first quarter  earli second   perhap they   re right  but i remain to be convinc by the

thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ continu to expand moder in our district in novemb   manufactur shipment and new order buck the nation trend and rebound last month follow an octob dip   revenu and hire slow a bit in the servic sector but continu to expand moder   retail was a bright spot   store report an uptick in sale and custom traffic for novemb  includ the thanksgiv weekend   our store contact were general op ist about sale prospect for the come holiday season   fifth district hous activ continu to soften on the whole  although there are area that have seen much less  if ani  of a slowdown   we   re not hear ani report of cutback in capit expenditur  and commerci real estat market appear to remain fair strong in our district  report on price pressur were mix in novemb but remain at elev level  at the nation level  an essenti question seem to be how long the current weak will persist   to a larg extent this question center on the hous market  and it   s still hard to pin down the outlook with much certainti   the special survey on homebuild paint a pictur that vari wide across the countri   construct activ is fall at a rapid clip in mani region  but mani hous market are still fair stabl   nation  there are some indic suggest that hous demand has stabil at a low level   sale of new home have been fluctuat around an annual rate of   million sinc juli  and purchas mortgag applic have been fair flat sinc then as well   but the nation data also show a sizabl overhang of hous inventori that will continu to depress new build activ go forward   if   and  like    i recogn this is a big    if      the demand for hous hold up at current level   and favor fundament such as moder   mortgag rate and continu real incom gain should help   then the adjust process is simpli a matter of work inventori down   this is consist with the  book   s es  that residenti invest will no longer subtract from real gdp growth after the first half of next year  the strength in nonresidenti construct has until recent offset the declin in residenti  most recent report show nonresidenti construct spend and employ fall in recent month  although i   m struck by the fact that there are hard ani refer in the beig book to deterior in commerci construct and we aren   t hear such report from our contact either   so i   m not sure how much to mark down the nonresidenti outlook just now  as   said  consum spend keep chug along at about   percent despit weaken auto sale   this is notabl becaus one way the hous downturn could spread to the remaind of the economi is through a wealth effect   so far i   m not persuad by this gloomi view  and i think there are good reason to doubt it   household net worth look pretti strong  and equiti continu to advanc   the other lead candid for a spillov channel is the labor market  but so far the weak in construct and real estat relat employ has not been larg enough to offset the broader strength in employ   i remain skeptic of a hous induc step down in consumpt growth   busi invest continu to be a sourc of strength   the  book note the possibl of negat acceler effect  but the other fundament still look good   profit is high  and cost of capit is low   moreov  financi market are not show sign of impend busi weak or invest slowdown   in sum  it look as though the current weak is like to be relat transitori  and after the hous market correct play out  we should return to near trend growth   there are risk to this outlook  to be sure  but this is what look most like to me right now    the recent news on inflat has been disappoint yet again   it is now quit difficult to discern ani moder trend in core pce inflat over the past sever month   you have to be realli care in select how mani period you averag over  and i have serious doubt about the forc that are describ as slow inflat over the forecast period   first  the recent fall in energi price is now behind us by a coupl of month  and price are begin to rise again   if the  book forecast is correct and in      crude oil price rise somewhat abov their current level of     per barrel  then we have seen all we are go to see of the abat of the effect of higher energi price on core inflat  speak to presid     s point   second  sinc the odd seem to favor a further depreci of the dollar  i think import price are unlik to help eas inflat much   third  as we   ve discuss at previous meet  the project increas in unemploy is not like to have much of an effect on inflat  over the forecast period at least   on top of all this  inflat expect appear to be anchor between   and    percent right now  and they   re like to exert a gravit pull counteract ani moder of inflat   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   my outlook for the economi hasn   t chang much sinc our last meet  but i have becom more concern about the risk to the outlook for real growth   so in my comment this morn  i   ll explain whi my risk assess has chang  the homebuild with whom i spoke over the past sever week told me that the low interest rate and the new financi product creat an environ in which they did five year    worth of busi in the space of three year   they said that most homebuild recogn that this pace of activ was unsustain and so they plan accord   a few small builder have declar bankruptci  and other still may do so  but for the most part  builder feel that they are   financi prepar to make it through the next one or two year of poor busi   so the financi condit of homebuild is not my chief concern  howev  i have becom more worri about the potenti spillov of hous condit into consum spend from wealth effect  incom constraint  and creditworthi   i think i   m go to give the counterpoint to presid   on these issu   the  book point out that the ofheo price index is still increas a bit  but the builder i met with convinc me that the publish price for new home don   t accur reflect market condit   seller are offer nonpric concess  such as upgrad for applianc  carpet  fixtur  and so forth   some builder are go to great length to keep publish price up   i   ve been told stori of builder in arizona who have been give buyer new lexus as part of the overal deal so that they don   t have to bring down the price in their subdivis   also  it seem as though owner of exist home are not yet will to reduc their ask price by veri much   with potenti buyer still wait for price to fall further  traffic level and transact are low   it seem as though market are not yet close to function smooth  and homebuild are tell me that it could take anoth year befor buyer and seller exhibit more confid   i am concern that we don   t yet have a good handl on where hous price are head and how the uncertainti surround hous price might affect consum spend   second  the support to consumpt provid by cash out refinanc is not like to be avail go forward to the same degre that we   ve had dure the past sever year   final  the financi condit of some household has becom pretti fragil  and we all know that rate on adjust mortgag  includ some subprim mortgag loan  continu to reset at higher rate   the adjust rate mortgag are alreadi caus some well public problem for some household    builder in my region report that the abil of potenti homebuy to qualifi for home mortgag is becom an issu   one homebuild from columbus told me that he is give away new car as well  but his motiv provid a twist on the lexus stori   some of his custom are struggl to qualifi for mortgag loan   so he   s give them new car so that they can get rid of their current car and the payment oblig that go along with them    laughter   he   s not give them a lexus  he   s give them a kia    laughter   now  if we could get these homebuild to adopt a buy american strategi  we might also be abl to solv our domest auto problem  as i said at the outset  i don   t have a major disagr with the  book baselin   i think that the outlook for near term growth has deterior a littl sinc octob  and the  book reflect that   i just think that there   s greater likelihood that the real economi could prove to be weaker than the baselin in the  book in       and the key risk in my view is the degre of spillov from the hous market into the rest of the economi   the  book   s extend hous declin altern scenario repres this risk  although i have not yet heard stori that are quit as dramat as the    percent declin in home price in that scenario  not much has chang  as mani other have alreadi comment  in the inflat outlook  the inflat trend continu to be hard to interpret  but i still expect core inflat to drift down gradual over the forecast period   although there is still a risk that inflat will remain higher than i desir  i think that favor compens develop and declin in shelter cost could speed that rate of declin   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool

thank you    laughter
i think i may be abl to clarifi the wal mart outlook a bit   there   s been a lot of public that wal mart report novemb year over year same store sale to be  i think      percentag point down   the wal mart take on the situat is that the problem is about    percent in the forecast that they had and about    percent that sale are actual come in a littl weaker than forecast   the big miss is that  in the year over year comparison  there   s an endur effect that was larger than they had earlier realiz of the sale in the hurrican affect region   peopl whose home were destroy went out and bought toa   apparel  and all sort of other thing to replac the stuff that they lost  and that pump up year ago sale   they   re expect that effect to continu to affect year over year comparison through march  obvious taper off   the other thing that they note   and this i think is perhap a littl more problemat   is that they continu to open lot of store   they know that the store locat in some case cannib sale from exist store   so when they tri to make allow for those thing  they say that octob and probabl also in novemb  although they haven   t complet that analysi  would have been about     percent abov  year over year   they would have expect on this basi     percent to   percent   so they are run below the expect   the overal impress of the holiday season is that it   s go to be good but not great   on the averag shop basket  the price for good sold are up about     percent year over year   wal mart   not see much inflat pressur   they expect to be seek price cut from supplier   appar consum product compani general adjust price in the first quarter of the year  and they end up negoti with wal mart  and wal mart is expect to ask for some price reduct   a contact with a major money center bank indic that their analysi of their credit card activ suggest that year over year retail sale have deceler a littl   they expect the holiday retail season to be okay but not great    my contact at up said in a convers last week that the christma season has been somewhat slow to materi in term of volum sinc thanksgiv   when i talk with him ye day afternoon  he said that probabl most of that was a consequ of weather  which delay their volum   perhap more interest  up is expect intern volum to be up    percent in      compar with        their       over       output was      percent     to    is a signific declin in growth   for domest express  they   re expect         i guess the annual averag   to be up     percent over        the       over       comparison was     percent   so the deceler in       is signific   on the labor front  they don   t have ani particular issu  and they   re not have labor avail issu   my fedex contact had a similar outlook   fedex has somewhat downgrad it expect for next year   again  he said that the compani is start to see momentum soften    as mani other are     the most downbeat contact was a larg truck firm   he start off by say that    thing are pretti slow      he said that the truck busi never had a third quarter or fourth quarter peak  they just didn   t have a ship peak   he said their custom are not too concern   ship rate are down   to   percent year over year  and they   ve actual cut pay for new driver   they had increas it back in juli   they put the new driver pay back where it had been befor  and they have also been lay off some driver   i guess that   s the main thing   the compani is not buy ani new truck next year  i have a coupl of comment on the outlook   to me the onli way to reconcil what we see go on in the equiti and the bond market is that the market togeth are anticip declin inflat pressur and continu good econom growth   one market or the other may be make a mistak  but if you want to assum that they   re well inform peopl make good es   then it seem to me that   s the way to reconcil those observ   my view of the  book forecast is   that it   s veri sensibl   my own assess is that outcom abov or below the forecast on both output and inflat have rough equal probabl  they   ve cut it right down the middl   it make good sens   both the  book and the blue chip and other forecast have been reduc their forecast for         if you look at the  book  part    page     there   s a nice chart of how the forecast has come down over this year   that   s all for me right now   thank you
mr  chairman
bill  you talk about reconcil bond and equiti market base on a view that inflat pressur will eas and growth will be good   when you say    inflat pressur will eas     do you mean that inflat will come down or that we will not be motiv to rais real rate
one possibl would be to say that the market might believ that we will be perfect okay with inflat continu to run          or someth like that   that is a possibl   but the way i would look at it is that the market would probabl believ that we would be just hold the fed fund rate target constant in that situat   to have a market forecast of a declin fed fund rate  which is what   s in the bond market  it seem to me that you have to be anticip that rate will come down   now  i think that can   t be a recess outlook becaus otherwis the equiti market wouldn   t be as strong as it is   so that   s whi i came to that conclus  one market or the other may be make a mistak  but i was say that   s what i think is the best explan of what the market see
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom pictur in our region has chang littl sinc our last meet   the coincid indic in our busi outlook survey suggest that econom activ continu to expand at a moder pace in each of our three state  and the busi contact expect that pace to continu   i   m begin to feel as though i   m read the same chapter of the book again   it   s like yogi berra   it   s dj vu all over again  the weakest sector in our region  as in the nation  is of cours hous  which continu to declin   sale and permit continu on a downward trend  and cancel rose signific in novemb  but builder have been abl to resel  albeit at lower price  home whose initi purchas have reneg   howev  our survey of smaller homebuild suggest that condit on averag in the hous market in our district seem somewhat better than in the nation as a whole  none of the builder we poll report low inventori of unsold home   interest enough     percent of them said their inventori were about right  onli    percent said inventori were high  and no one report that they were extrem high   in comparison  across the nation     percent of builder report that inventori were either low or about right  and    percent report either high or extrem high inventori   certain some area in our district have had a sharp drop in hous activ   the most notabl is the jersey shore   but general  base on what i   m hear from firm in our district  i would continu to character the declin in hous in our region as an order one  commerci real estat continu to perform veri well   we   ve had some downturn in the valu of nonresidenti build contract in the last month  but these data are veri volatil  and the revis tend to be upward as new contract are report over  e   our contact in that sector continu to be among the most op ist in our region   offic vacanc rate continu to declin in the past few month both in center citi philadelphia and in the suburb  and the net absorpt of   offic space continu to be posit   rent have risen  and the increas in occup has led to a scarciti of larg block of avail space  which bode well for construct  manufactur activ in our region has been soften this fall  and we haven   t seen much of an increas sinc then   after two negat read in septemb and octob  the general index of econom activ in our busi outlook survey turn posit in novemb  but it level of slight abov   suggest that that   s realli not much chang in the outlook   new order and shipment were modest weak   shipment were actual strong   order were a littl weaker  but the recent weak is consist with soft in nation manufactur and  as we   ve seen  in the purchas manag    index   op  for futur capit spend actual rebound last month   so the pictur there is veri mix   consum spend continu to hold up well   auto dealer and retail report strong sale in novemb and are op ist about the holiday season  labor market condit in the district have chang littl   payrol employ growth in our three state is up at an annual rate of about     percent  which is slower than the nation rate  but that   s just a fact of the popul growth in our district   unemploy rate remain low  near or below the nation rate   busi contact continu to cite difficulti in find qualifi worker  especi for skill and profession posit   area employ indic that  over the past few month  wage have been steadili rise at a pace higher than earlier this year  i also want to mention some anecdot inform that i find interest   last week i met with a number of most manufactur ceo from my district   an observ that one of them made  which mani agre with  was that from their perspect money was almost free   this observ is consist with what some other have been say around the tabl   they thought that there was plenti of liquid and that interest rate were not limit them particular in ani way   this observ is also consist with the view that mortgag rate are still relat low   and that credit spread show less stress on busi at this point   i take these observ to indic that monetari polici is not particular restrict at this point  also on the anecdot side  the sever manufactur who particip as supplier to both homebuild and commerci real estat lament their hous relat busi  whether plumb  cabinetri  or floor  which were the three industri repres   on the residenti side  the market were terribl   busi was veri bad   howev  they all said that the commerci side was boom so much that it more than made up for their weak on the residenti side so that busi tend to still be pretti good  in contrast to presid pool   s comment about truck  i had one truck ceo who said actual that busi was good   it was weak in the northeast   shipment were down there   but in the south and west their busi was pick up and do pretti well   he also made an interest comment that i had not realli thought about   he said that part of the chang in truck is that  while volum may be down and they are have troubl find driver  there has also been a revolut in packag   in fact  even though truck volum are down  the valu of product and good be ship is actual up   as an exampl  they use to ship the big boom box that peopl listen to music on  now they   re ship ipod   so as packag has becom more effici and more protect  the truck volum is less  but the valu is actual higher   he said that this was an ongo trend in the truck industri and that one had to be care about interpret volum  on the inflat front  manufactur continu to report higher product cost  but these cost increas have been less widespread than recent survey indic   index of price paid and price receiv have continu to climb  and they   re still abov where we   d like to see them    on the nation side  my outlook has chang veri littl sinc our last meet   compar with earlier this year  growth has weaken  as we all know and have discuss   hous slow a littl fa  than perhap we anticip but   i agre with presid     the prospect of spillov remain relat low   again  as bill applaud     s wonder one hand two hand present  the labor market are send a complet differ signal   as i said earlier  manufactur and employ in our region continu to find scarciti in the labor market  both skill and unskil   if we thought that the economi were weaken and we expect growth to remain appreci below potenti and weak for a number of addit quarter  it might be import to allow short term interest rate to move down   but not becaus i think the fed can do much to prop up growth in those circumst  that is  to ride some kind of phillip curv   after all  busi say there   s ampl liquid  and mortgag rate remain relat low   but becaus equilibrium market rate may be lower over a sustain period  we might want to see a fed fund rate that   s consist with that   this would be particular relev if we were sanguin about inflat  howev  in my view  we   re not in that situat yet  as has been allud to  mani market comment have point to the invers of the yield curv as an indic that recess is probabl  but as suggest by the chairman and the research that has been done  some of it by the board staff  the predict power of chang in the slope of the yield curv depend on whi the slope of the yield curv chang   the chang in the slope of the yield curv suggest by the research that was allud to earlier has been about     basi point  but about half of that has been in the risk premium associ with long term rate   at the same  e  the predict content of that risk premium chang for recess or gdp growth is much less than absolut chang in real rate   so i take that research to say that the invers of the yield curv may be forecast slower growth but not a recess to date    thus  inflat remain a signific concern to me   recent read on headlin inflat have shown some encourag downward movement  and inflat expect have remain stabl   but the level of core inflat continu to be higher than what i consid to be consist with price stabil   moreov  the forecast   not show us reestablish price stabil in the near futur   that   s a reason  although unwelcom  forecast to the extent that veri accommod monetari polici over the past five year help fuel the acceler of inflat and that monetari polici and financi market have not tighten much and aren   t expect to tighten much over the come period   the bluebook indic that the current real fed fund rate is within the rang of model base es  of the equilibrium rate   that is  polici is not terribl tight   and  as i suggest earlier  long rate includ mortgag rate are at relat low level  suggest ampl liquid in the market  i   m not convinc that price stabil will be achiev without further action on the part of the fed  and i   d feel more comfort after see a few more month or even anoth quarter or two of deceler   the slight deceler in core inflat that we have seen  coupl with the slower econom growth  has meant that implicit firm of polici even without a chang in the nomin fund rate might be in the card  and that would be a welcom chang   i   m not convinc that the recent declin in energi price will provid the relief we would like to see in core inflat  as suggest by   and my question earlier  i   m concern that  if oil price stabil around     a barrel  we will see core inflat begin to creep back up onc the temporari benefit of the declin have disappear   inde  gasolin price have alreadi risen somewhat in the past few week from the low that we saw in late septemb and earli octob   as has been mention  the sharpest increas in the compon of inflat that we   ve look at over the past few month seem to be in those element that are least like to be influenc by energi price   in addit  as   said  i   m   veri dubious that the gap measur that we allud to period are go to act as much of a constraint on price increas go forward   the bottom line is that i   m not hope that energi price or the output gap will provid us with much of the inflationari relief that we   re look for  thank you  mr

thank you  mr  chairman   overal  the tenth district economi continu to expand at a moder pace   activ has slow somewhat  but our region is still probabl do a littl better than the nation as a whole   one area in which we may be do a bit better is hous  even though we have slow just as everyon els has   our survey show that the inventori of unsold home  although elev  are less than they are in other region of the countri and that they have not acceler much sinc last summer   our real estat contact have indic to us that they think inventori will be come down over the next few month becaus the slow in construct is bring them back into line   it will take some  e  howev  on the manufactur side also  we have a bit more posit inform in the region than perhap nationwid   while we have had a slowdown in area relat to hous and auto  the area relat to oil and gas  railroad  commerci offic  and high tech equip in the district are general note strong and even increas demand  and we   re expect those busi to expand their oper accord   some of our machinist and machin manufactur organ have actual seen some fair strong growth  and their six month outlook is also strong  especi in the export sector   energi activ has remain strong in the district  despit some declin in our mountain region  where cost of drill are higher  and   that has caus some reduct in rig count   other area in the oklahoma panhandl and so forth are realli go quit strong  consum spend remain solid  and earli holiday return have general been quit posit   mall manag in the district   s citi report solid traffic after thanksgiv  and we   re off to a veri good start for the decemb holiday   labor market also remain fair good in the region  and as other have report  our demand for skill labor is realli quit good  and find individu to fill posit is difficult right now   howev  a coupl of piec of anecdot inform offset that a bit   in the past coupl of month  the temporari hire area has had a slowdown in their sale growth  which surpris the chairman of our board of director to some degre   i don   t know whether he mention this last week when he was here   also  a coupl of major truck firm  while not say that busi is bad or anyth like that  are say that busi is notic slower than it has been in other such holiday period   whether or not it   s packag they   re not will to say  but they are say that it sure is slower  on the nation outlook  i don   t have ani real disagr with the  book in that we see growth to be below potenti   what potenti is may be a question   howev  we do see growth below potenti but return gradual over      into        obvious risk to that forecast are  on the downsid  hous and  on the upsid  perhap some strength in foreign demand   we have seen the latter  as i mention  in our manufactur sector  and i think it may bring some strength to the economi as we look ahead  on the inflat front  our outlook is for inflat to come down gradual   we continu to think that monetari polici is slight restrict   and  with that  inflat number   for exampl  core cpi inflat would come down from     percent to     percent in       and perhap to     percent in        the core pce would averag around   percent over      and       fall   from     to       those are obvious rough es   but they are show the trend   the risk  of cours  are in what happen to energi   on the other side  frank  is what happen to the dollar becaus  if that continu to go down  it would creat some upsid inflationari pressur that we   d have to think about and deal with as we go forward   so with that  i will stop and wait for the polici discuss for the rest of my comment   thank you

product in the unit state  and these firm have report that they are scale back product as well as employ   we expect the negat effect on construct relat sector   to intensifi over the next few month as builder complet current project and signific curtail futur project   lend relat to real estat has been a signific sourc of revenu and growth for district bank in recent year   our bank contact report that the pipelin of real estat lend has all but dri up   some also note concern about the prospect financi strength of smaller builder  although most expect the larger builder to be abl to weather the downturn   on the consum side  asset qualiti remain good  but some bank note concern about the potenti negat effect from adjust rate mortgag reset that will occur in       the good news for the hous outlook is that the continu declin in start and the level off of sale may have arrest the run up in the inventori of unsold new hous   it   s hard to tell if we   re get close to the bottom of the hous slump   sever of our builder contact in florida say that they expect sale to improv in the second quarter of        also  most contact expect a pickup in the multifamili rental

as   the slow in manufactur that now appear to be in progress   howev  sever factor suggest that the slowdown is transitori and that the risk is relat small that it will turn into a full fledg recess

thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   two or three develop in the district economi are worth note  and they seem consist  by the way  with what   s happen at the nation level   first  overal  the labor market  exclud construct  appear to be continu to improv   hire is expand  and the avail of job appear to be grow   some of that growth is no doubt season  but my impress is that it goe beyond the typic season increas of this  e of year   second  hous sale of both new and exist home appear to be stabil in year over year comparison   that is clear a favor develop   howev  i think the adjust in residenti construct activ like still has some consider distanc to go   numer project are under way  mani of them are in midstream   so the inventori of unsold home  particular of condominium  is like to remain high for the forese futur  and i think the implic is that no sizabl new project will be get under way ani  e soon   as far as the nation economi is concern  i agre with the pattern in the  book of gradual improv growth in econom activ after the current and perhap the next quarter  but i continu to expect such growth to be a bit higher than express in the  book for the reason i   ve cite recent   sustain gain in employ  rise equiti valu  lower energi price  moder interest rate  and overal general sound financi condit   similar  i wouldn   t quarrel veri much with the  book trajectori as far as it pertain to core inflat   i think that  if this outlook is achiev  the outcom would not be at all bad  particular if inflat diminish a bit more quick than it   in the forecast   unfortun it   s hard at the   moment to see the precursor of such a develop  and the lower dollar is not like to help  howev  i   m not alarm by the unemploy rate at     percent  and i wonder if we   re get anoth test of the ex ant valu of the nairu in forecast inflat    laughter   as to the risk to econom growth  some of the recent data  although not those pertain to the labor market  have been on the soft side relat to my expect   the persist invers of the treasuri yield curv has my attent as well  perhap belat   but it   s hard to know with ani confid what to make of the latter factor  given hypothes about save glut  asset shortag  and so forth   moreov  other approach beyond analysi of the yield curv to es  the probabl of recess general provid figur that are quit low   the under resili of the economi add to my confid that busi activ is like to improv rather than deterior from here   i would add that i am not hear ani of the negat anecdot that i heard in late      befor the onset of the      recess   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   our forecast hasn   t chang much sinc the last meet   we still expect growth to move back to potenti in the first half of next year and to stay in the vicin of potenti  which we think is around   percent  over the forecast period   we expect inflat  as measur by the core pce index  to fall to just under   percent by the end of         our view of the outlook differ from the  book in two respect  as it has over the past few cycl   we have a higher es  of potenti growth  with the differ due to higher es  of labor forc growth  and we expect more moder in inflat than the  book    princip becaus we believ there is less inertia  less persist in inflat in the unit state than   the staff   both these issu  of cours  deserv continu analysi and   attent by the committe   these differ in our forecast relat to the  book don   t extend to the polici assumpt   both outlook are predic on a like path of the fed fund rate that   s near flat over the next sever quarter   this path  of cours  is abov the one current reflect in financi market   of cours  although some disagr between our view and the market   s view is not unusu  the size of this gap is signific enough to warrant some attent   it   s hard to know  howev  what the sourc of the differ is and  therefor  what the implic are for what we do in term of polici   the risk to the forecast may have shift somewhat in the direct of less upsid risk to inflat and more downsid risk to growth   but to us  the current weak in the economi still seem princip to stem from the direct effect of the slowdown in hous on construct activ and relat part of the manufactur sector as well as from the reduct in automobil and auto relat product   as thing now stand  the softer than expect recent number don   t argu  in our view  for a substanti reassess of the risk in the outlook   survey of busi sen ent outsid the manufactur sector still seem consist with reason growth go forward   a slowdown of invest in equip and softwar  sn   t seem to be particular troubl to us at this point   consum spend seem to be grow at a fair good pace  employ growth  of cours  is still quit solid  and growth outsid the unit state still look pretti good   we think the fundament of the expans go forward still look good  with strong household incom growth even after the lag effect of the recent downward revis  product growth in the rang of     percent for the nonfinanci corpor sector  and strong corpor balanc sheet in the unit state  and prospect for continu expans outsid the unit state   our recent financi market data don   t  in my view  provid a convinc case for   a substanti increas in the probabl of a much weaker path for growth go forward  although the yield curv is invert and long rate continu to drift down  staff research and other indic suggest that part of that is due to a declin in term premium  and forward rate seem to be come down around the world still   this gradual reduct in term premium and forward real rate global suggest that what we   re see in the long term interest rate in the unit state may not be princip a sign that confid in the u s  growth outlook has deterior   it   s not clear even    month after the conundrum first emerg whether equilibrium rate global have realli move substanti lower   the bluebook es  suggest we   re still within most es  of equilibrium real rate in the unit state   equiti price and credit spread are consist with the view of sustain expans go forward   all this seem to reinforc the case for the judgment that we have not yet induc over restrict financi condit   we still face consider uncertainti about the outlook for growth and the familiar sourc of downsid risk  but to us these still seem to rest main with the possibl that a more acut and protract fall in hous activ and price will caus a signific deceler in hous and household spend and ul  busi spend   the natur of these risk  howev  hasn   t chang in our view  and the probabl that the risk will materi may have risen a bit but not much   on balanc  this situat should reduc the probabl that we   ll have to tighten further  but it  sn   t seem to suggest that today we need to induc a further eas in overal financi condit   on the inflat front  we confront the familiar mix of under inflat still at uncomfort high level and consider uncertainti about whether we   ll see enough   moder soon enough to keep expect stabl at reason level   the remain inflat risk  in other word  are about whether we get enough moder   in the absenc of a dramat differ outcom for the dollar and energi price than what   s in the forecast  we don   t see much risk of inflat acceler from current level or remain stuck at current level   we haven   t had much evid to justifi a signific chang in the expect path of inflat or in the risk of that forecast   the news on unit labor cost may be a bit reassur  survey seem to suggest some evid of diminish price power  which might impli that margin will adjust downward to absorb futur rise in labor compens   the odd of an earli return to abov trend growth seem to have reced a bit   most of the altern measur of under inflat that mani of us look at seem to have moder a bit after the sustain earlier period of acceler   inflat expect deriv from tip have eas a bit   these piec of inform are somewhat comfort  but they don   t chang the fact that our expect that we   ll achiev the desir moder in inflat without further tighten of monetari polici remain just that   it is an expect or a hope  it is not yet realiti   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you have remark  the incom data on spend at least have been consist with our basic outlook for econom activ  weak in hous and auto will hold activ to below the growth rate of potenti for a few quarter but with limit spillov to other form of household spend   as inventori overhang in these two sector are dealt with  growth will return to someth like the growth rate of potenti   from some perspect  the recent data have actual suggest diminish downsid risk to the stori   stabil hous sale  recov mortgag applic  and improv consum attitud toward home purchas may be the sign of a hous market   begin to find a bottom   the expect downward path of price in the case shiller index futur market has actual been revis higher over the intermeet period  it is still slope down but not as much   auto produc have held product steadi in the fourth quarter and announc a small increas in product for the first quarter   moreov  consumpt outsid auto has remain on a healthi track   now  the downsid risk in these area may be smaller  but they certain haven   t been elimin   the  book project has start stabil at the current level  but we have yet to see hard evid of that stabil   the last data point was a substanti declin that was larger than we expect   inventori overhang in the hous sector are larg and will be work down fair slowli in the staff forecast   head of household may be just come to the realiz that their kid    tuition and their retir will not be taken care of by further outsiz increas in the valu of their home   a bit more troubl than the hous and consumpt data   and perhap indic of other sourc of downsid risk   have been the rise in inventori and the soft in manufactur product outsid the auto and construct relat sector   much of the downward revis to privat final demand from the last  book to this one  take into account both the third and the fourth quarter  was in busi fix invest  and it occur when profit remain robust and sale   exclud auto and residenti hous   strong  evid of broader weak in the manufactur sector seem to account for at least a portion of the reaction of the financi market over the intermeet period   there are a number of reason to think that this weak is limit   the under economi remain in good shape   commod price have continu to climb  probabl part reflect the weaker dollar but also indic of under strength in global demand   firm   are ad to payrol in a way they wouldn   t if they were sens the possibl of soft spread outsid manufactur   equiti price and risk spread suggest expect of continu good growth  even if in the eye of investor it might take some eas of polici to produc that outcom   as presid  n note  anecdot   as reflect in the beig book and what we   ve heard from visitor  includ the reserv bank chair and vice chair who were here veri recent   suggest that busi are experienc and expect continu good busi condit   these anecdot veri mark contrast to the fall of       when by novemb the tone of the feedback from busi had turn decid gloomier   the committe has been focus on hous and consumpt  but the recent data and the financi market   s respons may suggest the possibl that someth els could be go on   perhap the remov of polici accommod has affect other form of spend more than we had anticip   i think that the basic stori of growth strengthen to potenti over the next year remain valid and that it will be strong enough to withstand a rise in longer term interest rate that would accompani a flat fed fund rate as in the  book   moreov  the overal downsid risk to that forecast probabl haven   t increas veri much  but they may have chang sourc or charact   we will need to be alert to possibl sourc of weak that we hadn   t anticip   with regard to the inflat outlook  i  like the staff  have character the incom data as leav expect for a veri gradual declin in inflat intact  if the economi follow someth like the  book path   to be sure  core pce inflat did not eas back  but the cpi did quit a bit   labor cost pressur appear to be less than we had previous es   and various measur of long term inflat expect remain within their rang of the past sever year     my presumpt  like that of the staff  is that at some point lag spend growth will be reflect in labor market and will help to remov inflat pressur   but for now  the risk around the expect downward trend in inflat remain skew to the upsid   unit labor cost are still acceler  although not as much as we thought they were  and busi won   t readili absorb higher cost and reduc profit margin   the unemploy rate remain low  the index of capac util in manufactur continu to be abov it long term averag  suggest continu pressur in resourc market and  by extens  in market for good and servic  which will contribut both to higher cost and to the abil of busi to pass them on   the forecast path to inflat is suffici gradual that upward deviat from it could entail outsiz cost in term of embed anoth notch up in under inflat and inflat expect   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i   d start today talk a bit about hous market and the condit of bank right now   as mani of you have notic  some of us are op ist that we may be approach a bottom in the hous market   i think we   ll see that bottom in hous sale long befor we see it on the construct side becaus there   s a larg amount of inventori still to work through   but as we   ve note  the applic for purchas mortgag have been level sinc midyear   the growth in mortgag credit has slow signific from where it was in the past two year  drop to onli    percent growth this past quarter  a growth rate that is signific abov the growth of person incom and that most of us in the past would have consid to be alarm   part of what   s amaz in all of this is that in      and       particular toward the end of that period  purchas money second  by which peopl borrow the downpay for   home  were a big part of mortgag financ   bank are still get some of this busi and put it on their balanc sheet  and it is part of the growth of what you   re see the bank fund   but it is at a pace that i think need to be adjust   i   m say that  although the number of applic may have bottom out  the amount of leverag in each hous deal may still need some correct go forward  and so we may see some slowdown in the volum of dollar that are fund through mortgag lend   delinqu rate are realli  realli low by histor standard   the one sector that has had a jump in delinqu is subprim arm  and clear the jump is relat to rate that have alreadi reset   we   ve got more to come   even though these have jump  they   re still not at alarm level   but it   s someth that i think the bank are watch veri  veri care   one thing i   m hear more from some folk who have been invest in mortgag back secur and mayb in some cdos  collater debt oblig   where they   ve been tranch into riskier posit through econom leverag  is the realiz that a lot of the privat mortgag that have been securit dure the past few year realli do have much more risk than the investor have been focus on   i   m hear this from folk who understand that the qualiti of what goe into those pool vari tremend when you don   t have the fanni mae and freddi mac framework for the underwrit   when a mortgag is origin through a bank  we do a lot through safeti and sound supervis to make sure  if a bank is buy loan from broker  that the loan are underwritten in a sound manner and are therefor afford to the borrow when they   re undertaken   we   re see that some of the privat label mortgag back secur are have veri high earli default rate or delinqu in the mortgag  which usual mean that the origin has to buy them back out of the pool   there isn   t a whole lot of transpar in the disclosur around some of these bond  and some of the   broker are underwrit product that have veri high earli default rate  which is someth that investor are start to focus on   as more product are generat outsid the bank sector  they get funnel to pool through broker dealer as oppos to the bank   i think that we   re miss a level of due dilig regard broker  who may not be do a good job   as you all know  the fraud rate on mortgag has tripl in the past two year   so i think we could see nois in some of the mortgag back privat deal and some of the riskier cdo econom leverag posit   bank earn are realli  realli strong overal  especi by histor standard   bank are make a lot of layoff connect with the mortgag busi   they are take step to get cost   whether relat to origin  post loan close  or payoff administr   under control   net interest margin  howev  continu to be under signific pressur   i   m hear more from bank that  sinc we   ve stop rais rate  they   ve lost the nice littl lag effect   the abil to wait for us to move befor lag along   in other word  they have lost that lagniapp in their liabil cost that has help them with their margin pressur   so those pressur are go to be more of a challeng for them  especi with a flat or invert yield curv  depend on where they   re fund and lend   loan loss provis continu to be the best in mani  mani year   no one realli expect it to jump  but clear it can   t get a whole lot better than it is  and so that will also present challeng go forward   as for the economi as a whole  i  too  want to compliment presid   becaus i think she did a fantast job of help us think about the differ signal we   re get   when i look again at the graph that i love in the  book that show where our forecast has been  i was struck that we   ve seen the forecast of gdp growth continu to moder in the past sever month but our expect of inflat are actual flat to up a bit   to me that rais question   about the tradeoff that we realli have when we are run below capac and below potenti growth rate   the bit of soft that i   m hear about from some of my contact in sector outsid hous and mortgag warn me that we need to be a littl more vigil than i had been expect about growth mayb soften in a broader sens   but the fact that inflat continu to be abov   percent in the forecast period is someth that   concern me  and i think part of my concern relat to the tremend amount of liquid that sit out there in the bank sector  in the u s  financi market  and clear global   the presenc of this liquid is someth that we realli need to think about   it   s not back to where it was in my money suppli day  when i start my career at the st  loui fed  but i do worri that liquid is  as some of you have said  caus a lot of transact to occur that econom perhap wouldn   t otherwis occur   that is also someth we need to watch veri care
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me confin my remark to a coupl of discuss of the economi that bol  the theme that sever of you have note   at the outset  i   ll say that i continu to be more concern with the level of inflat and our progress regard it than i am with growth   the economi appear to be on track  and i think  unlik the  book project  that there   s a prospect for some upsid surpris on growth   so let me spend a few moment look at the labor market  the corpor profit market  household balanc sheet  and consum spend befor come back to the capit market a littl more broad   first  on the labor market side  as has been note previous  we continu to have surpris strong job gain  particular at this point in the cycl   the trend on revis  regardless of the data seri  tend to be continu upward   the labor market continu to   accept new worker into the labor forc more smooth  with the particip rate the highest sinc       which suggest a dynam in that market   hire plan of small busi have move to their highest level in near two year and tend to be a pretti good forward look indic  perhap a better indic than larg compani   in light of all that  i think the  book right acknowledg that the household survey may impli even greater strength than the payrol data suggest   second  turn to the profit pictur  there continu to be remark profit for the s p  the dow  and the broader market  predic on strong cash flow and record profit margin   broad base nipa profit are up    percent pre tax for the third quarter   s p deliv    percent profit gain in the third quarter   i think the trend there is particular tell  that is  es  by earn analyst continu to surpris on the upsid   as we move through the quarter  those bottom up es  continu to track veri  veri posit   i think that   s probabl a good indic of whi we   ve seen equiti price increas   when we look at where es  are for the fourth quarter  bottom up es  for the s p     are at about     percent   for       year over year increas of about     percent are expect   these number are veri strong  but they are signific down from the high doubl digit number that we   ve seen over the past coupl of quarter   my own sens is that continu to suggest good news for the equiti market and good news for corpor profit   i expect that equiti price will outperform over the next coupl of month if the number move up from   percent into the doubl digit   if that trend is revers and we see disappoint corpor earn  we could see a pretti rapid pullback in the equiti market  with some implic for the broader economi   i mention this discuss of profit and recogn that  though there is some correl between   corpor profit and the broader economi  we are continu to see a disproportion share of total incom come from this sector   so it   s a sector that we need to continu to evalu   third  turn to household balanc sheet  net worth grew      trillion over the past four quarter  as the fed   s flow of fund data suggest   asset are grow fa  than liabil  whether we includ or exclud hous  if we look at just the past four quarter   continu remark level of household and corpor liquid continu to suggest veri good news  although in these data we do see growth of household debt relat to incom  this is a trend over the past twenti five year  and i don   t realli note anyth over disturb there   so when we look at those three measur   labor  profit  and balanc sheet   i come to a pretti encourag conclus in term of an under sturdi to the economi  particular in regard to individu consumpt   let me turn to consumpt  with a bit of a short term focus here on the fourth quarter   i think the  book suggest anecdot that novemb might turn out to be a littl softer than octob and a littl softer than expect   my own sens is that some real upsid surpris are there   i had discuss with contact and review data from two larg credit card compani  which in total repres about    percent of all of consum buy over this period   this real  e inform end in novemb and look across demograph   it exclud subprim lender   the onli subprim folk in these two portfolio are those who began in the primari market and found their way into the subprim market   so i recogn that we are miss an import piec   howev  when you look at consum spend for novemb  you see littl to no deterior in credit qualiti   credit is still incred strong across region and incom group   i push each of the two compani to find area of weak  and they found this exercis to be pretti tough   their own intern credit measur have not shift   they had built   in some soften in novemb and decemb christma spend  which they have not seen  they continu to see a huge reservoir of untap credit  and they do see some de leverag by folk in key consum group  which they think suggest that consum are in veri good shape  the consum spend trend from these two contact continu to be veri posit   they expect to see growth in novemb on the order of   percent  they saw growth of     and   percent   though it   s too earli to call this christma season a success  they are much more posit than they were befor novemb began  in term of both dollar purchas and transact swipe   so my own sens is that the consum appear to be quit strong   have now list four area that i think have rather remark strength  i want to spend a moment on anoth topic that has been discuss around this tabl  which is manufactur   as we look at the manufactur base and we tri to evalu how we will know which inflect point the economi turn on  the manufactur data are like to be quit tell   i   ve been surpris and disappoint by poor manufactur ism  institut for suppli manag  data and other weak data  and i   ve ask myself whether the weak show some spread beyond auto and hous  which we   ve all discuss for some  e   when i look behind those data  i am comfort that much of the weak that we see in manufactur realli is consist with that theme   that is  second order and third order supplier into the auto and hous sector  other weak   appear to be relat to certain machineri and equip  but i have seen that weak more in the data than in the anecdot   as presid   suggest  i think that these data end up be somewhat weak  but the weak is transitori   the share price of most of these larg multin manufactur compani continu to outperform   the tone that these compani have when they   re meet with their analyst continu to be quit posit  so this signal may well be fals  but we have to focus a bit more on it   by the  e we   meet in the first quarter we   ll have a better sens of whether the manufactur base  in term of volum and product  is give us ani indic of what   s happen in the broader economi   let me turn  final  to the capit market   capit market  as has been mention around this tabl  continu to function well   the board staff has right observ that long term forward corpor credit spread are widen somewhat  show that these market  while awash in liquid  are respond to price signal and are start to focus increas on credit  in a coupl of instanc  issuer that tri to come to market  both in europ and in the unit state  were beaten back  which was  frank  good news from the perspect of market disciplin   the secur that they were tri to issu were pik note   these are paid in kind secur by which the compani can pay off the investor either in cash or through addit paper  and the pool of liquid for such note is not so deep   that kind of disciplin in the market should encourag us   have said that  i consid the debt capit market to be incred robust   i talk previous about remark pipelin that were at record level  they have all now price at signific benefici term   in novemb  as i think dino note  high yield corpor issuanc were at a record   the leverag loan market was also at a record  and we found instanc in which issuer obtain better term by issu in larger volum   that tell us that some peopl in the investor base realli want to get their full alloc   if they can get their alloc  they   re will to pay a premium for do so   the backlog price remark well  and i think those market are function well   let me enter the discuss about tri to reconcil the bond market and the equiti market by make four point   first  the leverag buyout data that dino discuss are one explan   that is  you don   t need to have a leverag buyout of a vast major or of even a   signific number of compani in the s p for those valu to find their way into the market  my view is that an lbo floor valuat now exist across more sector than we could have anticip befor   into technolog  for exampl   and compani that  becaus of their size  were previous out of reach for the privat equiti player   part of the growth that we   ve seen in the equiti market has occur becaus the lbo price that could theoret be paid  with balanc sheet that are probabl much less conserv  have rais the price that are paid in the capit market for these same compani   second  the differ between the equiti and the bond market is about earn growth and not multipl growth   on a price to earn basi  the suggest is that earn in      will be up someth like   percent over this year  and the price earn multipl don   t look out of whack   you end up with earn that  if they are deliv for anoth year or two  don   t make these compani look all that expens   third  in reconcil these market  i   d suggest that the differ is realli about us   the market think that  if the trajectori for the economi soften signific  the fed will be respons to it  notwithstand what we   re say current   that depend on the data mean that we will be agil and we won   t be stuck in our word of ye day in judg the economi that   s forthcom   so they believ that we will effect lower rate to achiev a veri soft but success land   final  expect are built into the bond market that rate cut are ahead  the discount rate in evalu cash flow for these compani obvious come down as well  further bol  their valu   so i suspect that these market are perhap a bit more consist than some market prognost would say   but we must continu to evalu them over the next sever week and month   thank you  mr  chairman
governor    i   m go to put you on the spot   you and mani other have talk about the liquid in the market  and i want to understand better   what that mean   first  liquid can refer to the avail of buyer and seller  clear  that has increas over the past year as we   ve had hedg fund and other actor increas their activ   that simpli make market more effici and lower the cost of trade   i don   t think that   s a bad thing  if that   s what we   re talk about   the second possibl refer to monetari aggreg  and we know that hasn   t been a serious concern   money growth has general been pretti slow   a third possibl  which is the one that i subscrib to  is that the big demand for asset reflect the global save glut  which mean that there   s an aw lot of money out there look for return that is come from abroad and from high rate of save relat to invest in other part of the world   but if the save glut is  in fact  a sourc of liquid  then actual  as presid   i believ mention  the equilibrium rate should be lower  not higher  to be consist with the real rate that clear the save and invest market   so i was just wonder  what is your view about the mean of this liquid issu
it   s a tough question  and i   ll tri to take it in turn  which is that most of the liquid phenomenon that i describ here and that we see in the u s  market  we describ in the fomc as a u s  phenomenon  but it   s realli a global phenomenon    so as we think about what this liquid tell us about interest rate  it   s hard to draw a certain conclus   that is  these market are increas global   the u s  multin financi compani that are success in have access to capit in worldwid market can take compani public in worldwid market   so even if you believ that the fed was too loos or over accommod  we   re somewhat limit in what we can do to stem that worldwid liquid for the reason that you mention   when i talk about liquid  moreov  i   m suggest part the first explan that you gave  which is that there is access to capit  which has been describ around this tabl as free   money  by more peopl in more invest that might not otherwis be satisfi a strict return on invest or return on equiti basi   so we   re see not onli smart capit from folk with long track record who have enter this market and can deploy their invest dollar but also folk with less experi who can financ themselv particular in the debt market in a way that was unimagin in previous cycl   so i think liquid realli mean a coupl of the thing you   ve note   obvious  i  like you  think that these monetari aggreg are not provid us with much insight   moreov  regard your initi point  we would have a hard  e dri up this liquid  if that   s what we attempt to do  given the global natur of the sourc and the use of fund
thank you   with apolog to governor   and    i think it   s  e to take coffe break    laughter   let   s take a fifteen minut break  and then we   ll come back   coffe break
let   s reassembl   governor    if you   re readi
last  e sever of us note that there would be an avalanch of data between the last meet and this one  laughter    two employ report  two round of ism  gdp  eci  compens revis  all of that   but it seem from the discuss here that we   ve actual gotten veri littl new inform  with one except  and that relat to dave     we heard that not long ago he was on the psychiatrist   s couch deal with a schizophrenia issu of whether the economi is go up or go down   but now we know that he is on his death bed    laughter   i hope this   not bode ill for the economi go forward  but i did want to note that one veri import chang  mr  chairman     we   ve had the same discuss of a two tier economi  with hous and auto be slower and the rest of the economi move forward  and continu concern about the risk of spillov  but the central tendenc seem to be that we   ll be move ahead perhap a littl below potenti  with some reason chanc of get back to someth closer to potenti by the end of next year   continu the discuss of labor market tight and some concern about shortag in certain area  i think that we certain have seen some soft in construct  but that   s an area for which we   ve probabl underes  employ growth and perhap employ falloff becaus  as i think mani of us know  mani of the subcontractor in residenti as well as nonresidenti hous have a lot of undocu worker  and they tend to be undercount both on the upsid and on the downsid   so there may be a littl more soft in the labor market than we   re see  at least in the construct sector  howev  in the higher skill sector  we   re see continu tight   consum spend continu to be strong   there has been just an amaz persist of consum spend  no matter what has happen over the past five year   whether the stock market has crash  whether the hous market has boom  whether we   ve had septemb     or whether we   ve had concern about spillov effect  the consum seem to have been veri  veri persist  and it seem as though that   s the case now   we   ve talk about challeng in the energi market  and we did see a littl slow   energi price were higher  and energi price are lower  but these aspect of the macroeconomi seem still to have littl effect on consum spend   we continu to have concern about some upsid risk to inflat   so i   ll just mention quick a few issu and then talk about some intern issu that dino and   touch on earlier   regard hous  we know we have terribl price data  but it seem as though there   s a   littl more flexibl and nimbl in the hous market than there was in the past   so the past data on hous may not be too use   although we know we don   t get good data on effect price  we do seem to be see more evid that peopl  rather than just hold thing on the market longer  are provid the marbl bathroom  the lexus  the hyundai  the kia  the yugo  or whatev they   re provid   in new jersey  where i grew up  it would be a yugo   laughter   so i think there   s more flexibl on that side   also  becaus of the way the hous market has develop  a lot of residenti construct is no longer at just the local level   the larg nation builder are better diversifi and  as has been discuss  have option on land  and then  if they see the market turn down  they give up those option   so they have a much greater abil to shift both down and up in product much more quick   price  too  are a littl more flexibl  which is one reason that we   ve seen a sharper correct in the hous market   but that flexibl  with the recent data indic that certain thing may be flatten out  may mean that  though the correct may have been sharper  it won   t necessarili persist   that the correct has occur in a shorter  e  rather than be drag out longer and have more potenti for negat spillov  confid effect  and so forth   well  what has chang   as governor kohn mention  inventori accumul is a bit of concern   it seem to be tick up   it alway seem a bit odd when a posit effect on gdp result from busi be unabl to sell the thing that they   ve purchas   that  sn   t strike me as necessarili a posit thing for a gdp report   we   ve gotten some more  probabl confus  number on product   is product slow or not   we are get some data that may be suggest that it is  although i would agre with dave and the staff that it   s much too earli to say   i think the evid both anecdot  as a number of peopl have mention  and more broad is that product is like to continu to go forward   anoth thing that   chang  as dino and other discuss  was the yield curv   but this phenomenon is veri much an intern one   long rate have come down more   sinc the last meet  they have fallen a fair amount and not just in the unit state   the three month versus the ten year in europ has fallen about    basi point  so the spread is about   basi point now   on averag  sinc the euro has been around  it has been about    to    basi point   in the unit kingdom  which tend on averag to have veri flat yield curv  the invers has steepen about    basi point to    basi point   japan is littl chang  but japan is sui generi   emerg market have also seen this   in mexico  for exampl  the ten year versus the three month has drop about    basi point   clear  this is not just a u s  phenomenon  and i think it   s tell us not just about u s  growth  unless you think that u s  growth is drive world growth and so it   s realli all about the unit state   i think that   s a bit extrem  even though  as was mention  some correl suggest that when the unit state goe down  there is a lag effect and the rest of the world tend to go down   but i think it   s suggest that some other factor is occur and that we shouldn   t read too much into it   also  interest  if you look at the real short and long rate around the world   at least for the industri countri   real rate tend to be about     to     percent  which is veri much where we are   thus there has been a converg of real rate around the world   so i would be wari of take too much inform from the bond market as refer to someth that   s specif to the unit state rather than to some factor that are common worldwid   just quick on inflat   we   ve talk about how energi price have gone up and down but core inflat hasn   t been affect that much   labor market tight  sn   t seem to have had much of an effect   as for output gap   if you like output gap   when you look at the data  it   s hard to find much evid of an effect of output gap on core inflat   also  given the   discuss that we   ve had  it  sn   t seem that the gap will be too wide or  even if you believ it will be wide  that you   d be get much effect from it in the near term   we talk about some temporari factor like owner    equival rent that may have boost measur inflat for a while and is now come down   i don   t think there will be much effect on inflat from the dollar   the unit state still is just not that open an economi   even to the extent that it is open  the pass through of exchang rate chang to domest price is veri slow and veri partial   typic  over a three year to five year period  bare    percent   the evid suggest that the pass through is decreas   even if the dollar went down further  i don   t see much of an effect there   that said  it   s hard to see exact what forc are move inflat in one way or anoth right now   a reason scenario is that it could drift down slowli  but it   s hard to point to clear evid of where it   s go to go   to the extent that there is inform in the yield curv  the market clear do not expect inflat to take off  and it   s like that inflat will be move lower or at least stay contain where it is   so we have much data and relat littl inform   i see risk on both the upsid and the downsid to growth and have continu concern about upsid risk to inflat precis becaus i don   t see an easi path to lower core inflat go forward   i think that lower core inflat in the futur is reason but uncertain  particular given that it   s hard to see a lot of systemat evid of factor that are occur now that would be correl with that result   thank
thank  mr  chairman   i see the economi evolv veri much along the line of the past coupl of  book  particular the one sinc i   ve been here   the staff is to be veri high commend   they point out that outcom were go to be weaker than other forecast thought  and they realli did get it right   now  i have promis dave that i   wouldn   t jump on him when they get it wrong  and today i   ll be nice in the other direct   i think their forecast has been veri use in term of the number   in fact  i think we   re see the economi evolv veri much along the line that we discuss at the past coupl of meet   there realli is not all that much new   i think there   s a smidgen more weak on the real side  but it  sn   t alter my basic view that the economi is evolv along the line of have slight below potenti gdp growth   i don   t see ani indic that we will have big spillov into other sector from weak hous and motor vehicl   in that sens  there   s a slight concern about a littl weak  but the right word is i guess a    smidgen     not a whole lot   i see that inflat pressur are also veri similar to what they were at the  e of our last meet   inflat is like to deceler to somewher around     percent in the core cpi and   percent in the core pce   part of the reason i believ those number is that the natur of the output path we   ve talk about is consist with them  but i also think that we have anchor inflat expect around those level   i don   t like to use the word    persist    the way other peopl do   i think of mean revers to expect inflat   and veri like that   s where inflat will be head  given the path that we see in term of the economi and the forecast from the  book   i see the risk to forecast inflat as fair balanc   the good news is that compens is not as scari as it was   but the bad news is that the labor market are veri tight  and we   re just not quit sure what the implic of that are go to be   so my view is that we have a bit greater uncertainti  not a whole lot  so that we need to be veri vigil on inflat becaus it is too high  labor market are tight  and there is still some question about how quick the mean revers to expect inflat will be   we also need to be vigil about real   output   there is a bit more certain inform come in  so i think we have to watch both inflat and output   the last thing to mention is the yield curv   i did some of the research on yield curv in recess  and i do not think that the yield curv is provid much inform at this  e  exact for the reason that governor   and other have discuss   i think there are special reason that the term premium is extrem low   there is alway that nice littl tabl of the yield curv and recess probabl  but you notic that i haven   t mention it  and i   m not go to mention it in the futur    laughter   thank you veri much
thank you   let me just summar and add a few comment   as governor   mention  we had an avalanch of data  and the snowman is still stand in the same place as befor    laughter   most peopl still see a two track or bimod economi   in the first part of the economi   the good economi  hous and manufactur   there seem to be some soften sinc the last meet but not a larg chang   hous remain the center of the weak   there are some indic that demand for hous may be stabil  but a few peopl note that there are probabl still some downsid risk in that sector   manufactur is also becom a bit softer  part but not entir link to hous   automobil  too  have soften  and a few other area as well  as i   ll discuss later   one interest point was that  where the aggreg data show some declin in growth in commerci real estat and the  book second that conclus  the anecdot do not seem all that consist with it   the second part of the economi  which is focus primarili on servic  remain quit strong  particular in sustain a robust labor market with good incom growth   togeth with lower energi price  those factor are lead to well sustain consumpt  which is continu to drive the economi forward   a few peopl   mention balanc sheet issu for the consum  but the refer to balanc sheet were both negat and posit   look forward  again to compliment the staff  i think most peopl around the tabl accept the general contour of the  book forecast   that is  moder growth perhap below potenti for the next few quarter but return to potenti growth later next year  with risk to the upsid as well as to the downsid   so far there is littl evid of spillov into consumpt in particular  although obvious we have to keep an eye on that   there are a number of strong under condit  includ support financi condit  strong profit  and a strong intern economi  which are provid a cushion to the economi   on inflat  i have to say there wasn   t much chang in view   most of you still expect a gradual declin in inflat   other are concern that we might get stuck at current level  even those who expect a gradual declin remain somewhat concern about the pace of the declin   some of the factor that may return inflat to lower level are a slow economi  well contain inflat expect  and the downward revis to the wage data   those who are more concern about inflat cite the weaken dollar  accommod financi condit  and the expect that growth will not be below potenti for veri long   so i think that some of these concern and risk assess do not seem mark differ from those at our last meet   let me add just a few comment   these are all margin becaus i think the broad outlin of the stori and the risk are quit reason   first  i think i took a bit more weak from the data in the first part of the economi than some peopl around the tabl   the  book has singl famili hous start level out at current level   they did fall    percent in octob   we   re not entir sure that they will  in fact  stabil   multifamili construct   permit have been drop   they   re off about    percent sinc the first quarter   that had been a sourc of stabil so far this year   there might be a bit less strength there   then  nonresidenti construct is an issu   the data  in term of employ and construct put in place  suggest some slow  and i do think that some slow from the veri strong pace of earlier this year is pretti much inevit   but the sens of the committe must be that we will have to wait a bit longer to judg how much that is go to slow   in manufactur  obvious the strongest slowdown are relat to auto and hous   but if you look at employ and the ism data  for exampl  you also see weak in area like machineri and electr machineri  which suggest some possibl weak in equip and softwar spend go forward  this remark   not repres a major differ with the committe  i just saw a bit more weak in the first area than some did   at the same  e  like mani member of the committe  i see a veri strong labor market and a veri strong servic sector plus a veri strong nonmanufactur ism  which  though it includ construct  was nevertheless still veri strong   one begin to wonder a bit about the measur of the servic sector   whether or not we are underst growth and product in that sector   that   s a question we   ll need to continu to consid   so like most peopl around the tabl  i think that a soft land with growth a bit below potenti in the short run look like the most like scenario   i expect the unemploy rate to increas gradual but incom growth and other factor to be suffici to keep consumpt abov   percent  which is essenti what we need to keep the economi grow   again  i see the risk go in both direct   let me add a coupl of extra comment about risk in the hous market   i talk last  e about the dynam of start   even if final demand stabil  start may take a  e to fulli   work out the inventori   a coupl of other factor are like that  which i just would like to bring to your attent   one has to do with the veri strong presumpt we seem to have now that demand for hous has stabil   that may be the case  but i would point out that we have seen a veri sharp declin in mortgag rate    peopl may have a sort of mean revert model of mortgag rate in their mind   it could be they are look at this as an opportun to jump in and buy while the financi condit are favor   so even if rate stay low  we face some risk of a declin in demand   the counter argument to that  which i should bring up  is that if peopl thought that price were go to fall much more  then they would be veri reluct to buy   that   s evid for stabil of demand   anoth point to make about hous is that  even when start stabil  there are go to be ongo effect on gdp and employ   on the gdp side  it take about six month on averag to complet residenti structur   therefor  even when start stabil  we   re go to continu to see declin in the contribut of residenti construct to gdp   on the employ side  i ask bruce fallick of the staff to run a regress of residenti construct employ on residenti singl famili start and to project forward what the employ result are go to be   accord to this regress  if start stabil at the octob level  as project by the  book  the job loss in that sector will actual continu to rise for the next two or three month and return to the novemb level of about        per month onli by the middl of next year   there will be lag employ effect from the hous sector and presum from the associ manufactur sector  like applianc and furnitur  which also tend to lag   so there will be some employ drag come forward  and i think it   s reason to think that unemploy rate will start to rise   but  again  this is about    percent of the economi as compar with    percent of the economi     on inflat  i agre that the latest core pce number was disappoint   i think perhap it overst the trend a bit  just as the core cpi number underst the trend a bit   i think there are still indic of a mild deceler in price  and most of the factor support that are come into place  includ the slow of rent  the improv energi situat  some increas in slack  and expect  which includ a five by five year expect which has come down about    basi point sinc we stop rais rate in august   so i think there are some base to expect a gradual declin in inflat   i would note also that outsid forecast are a bit more op ist about this than the  book is   for exampl  the blue chip median forecast of core pce inflat for next year is     percentag point lower than the  book on a compar basi   i   ve talk befor about owner    equival rent  which is a somewhat special categori  and i   ve indic that i think it slow will contribut to slower inflat   in the interest of be even hand  let me talk about a categori that might go in the other direct  which is medic cost   medic cost in the short run depend a great deal on govern polici  medicar reimburs decis  and the like   therefor  onli in the medium term will they respond to monetari polici   i think that   s a sourc of risk   the twelv month chang in medic cost has been declin   it was     percent in           percent in           percent in       and     percent so far this year   so that gradual declin in medic cost has been a posit in term of inflat   but in the latest month  the number was     percent on a one month basi  or more than   percent on an annual basi   to the extent that we see some bounceback of medic cost  that   s go to be anoth factor of concern in term of inflat go forward  again  howev  i think that we have some reason to think that inflat will slow  but i don   t   disagre with the veri wide sen ent i hear around the tabl that the slow is far from certain and that the risk are still to the upsid on inflat   are there ani comment on or question about my summari   if not  let   s go to    who will introduc the polici discuss
thank  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the materi that was distribut label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      financi market condit eas notic on balanc over the intermeet period   as shown in the top panel of exhibit    ten year nomin treasuri yield drop    basi point  the dollar declin near   percent  and equiti price rose more than   percent   as portray in the middl left hand panel  the declin in treasuri yield seem to have been prompt in part by incom spend and product data that were general weaker than investor anticip and inflat figur that were view as relat benign   the labor market report for octob and novemb  howev  came in at or abov market expect  interrupt the general downward trend in rate   as shown in the middl right hand panel  inflat compens was littl chang for the next five year  after adjust for carri effect  and was onli a littl lower for the subsequ five year  thus  almost all the declin in nomin yield repres a drop in real rate   the bottom left hand panel indic that one year nomin forward rate at the two year and three year horizon drop the most  but the declin in yield was spread across the forward rate curv   the fact that relat near term forward rate declin steepli seem consist with an interpret that investor mark down their view of the cyclic strength of the economi  but the consider drop in far forward rate seem to suggest that investor believ that more persist factor are also at work   as shown to the right  howev  primari dealer and blue chip forecast revis down their forecast for gdp growth over the five quarter end late next year by onli about   percentag point  and privat forecast of long run or potenti gdp were essenti unchang  leav unansw question about the sourc of the drop in rate   as can be seen in the top left hand panel of exhibit    our three factor term structur model attribut the declin in the ten year treasuri yield over the intermeet period primarili to lower term premium  the   portion of the bar  ten year term premium are es  to have declin from    to    basi point  leav them almost invis thin and around their record low   expect futur rate over the next ten year  the blue portion of the bar  are es  to have account for onli   basi point of the declin   howev  we have some doubt about this es  decomposit  in part becaus a sizabl drop in the term premium  which at least conceptu repres compens for interest rate risk  seem hard to squar with measur of interest rate uncertainti   as shown to the     materi use by mr  madigan is append to this transcript  appendix       right  impli volatil on treasuri yield  the black line  have edg up in recent week  and uncertainti about the eurodollar rate six month ahead  the red line  has risen quit notic   also  as shown by the blue bar in the middl left hand panel  the averag individu uncertainti that primari dealer express about the stanc of polici three meet ahead has crept up sinc the summer   in ani case  both market particip and market economist on averag anticip that polici eas is not far off   as indic in the middl right hand panel  primari dealer economist expect that the feder fund rate will averag      percent in the first quarter and      percent in the fourth quarter of        quot on fed fund futur  the right hand column  suggest that investor see an even steeper eas of polici  with the fund rate expect to drop about   percentag point over the next year   as shown by the red bar in the bottom left hand panel  the downward shift of rate expect over the intermeet period has been accompani by a greater leftward skew of the distribut   as note in the bottom right hand panel  dealer uniform expect you to keep the feder fund rate unchang today  and most anticip littl chang to the word of the statement apart from updat the character of the econom situat   a week ago  a minor expect a more signific soften of the statement  perhap by referenc downsid risk to growth or possibl even by describ the risk to growth and inflat as balanc  but inform report suggest that some have back off such expect in view of friday   s employ report   if committe member see signific odd that the market expect of a near term eas of polici could prove warrant  they might wish to start adjust the polici statement in that direct  as in the bluebook   s altern a  discuss in the top left hand panel of exhibit     while committe member might remain concern about the upsid risk to inflat with an unchang feder fund rate  they might also believ that the substanti slow in the hous sector  relat high inventori in some sector  and the sluggish of manufactur mean that the downsid risk to econom activ have increas and now rough balanc the upsid risk to inflat   such an increas in downsid risk could be a result of the gradual weaken of the near term outlook  particular if member place some weight on the possibl of nonlinear effect as econom growth slow   moreov  while we do not fulli understand what investor are react to  policymak may be concern that the declin in market rate could be signal a degre of econom weak that we do not yet appreci   also  our es  polici rule indic that maintain rate at their current level would be consist with the committe   s past behavior   on the other hand  the committe might see the recent eas of financi condit as one of sever consider tilt it toward altern c   as note in the top right hand panel  financi market evid are impart increas s ulus to aggreg demand even as labor market condit have tighten further  member may view that s ulus as unwarr and undesir if their view of econom fundament hasn   t chang much and may believ that at least some of it   should be offset by a firmer stanc of monetari polici   moreov  while core inflat has edg lower by some measur  it may not be seen as convinc on a downward trend   and even if the committe   believ that inflat is gradual eb  it may be dissatisfi with the anticip pace of that declin   these consider may motiv the committe to consid firm polici today   howev  the committe might onc again conclud that hold polici steadi at this meet is like to be consist with achiev it goal over  e while perceiv that  if anyth  modest addit firm may be requir  as in alter b   although the  book forecast for near term activ has been mark down slight  the medium term outlook is essenti unchang  and as illustr in the middl left hand panel  the real feder fund rate remain at the upper end of the rang of model base es  of it short run equilibrium and slight abov the  book consist measur   in the  book  maintain the current stanc of polici over the next two year produc econom growth a bit below that of potenti in      and core pce inflat that edg down slowli to about   percent by        while you would like prefer stronger output growth and lower inflat  you might find the outcom project in the  book to repres both a plausibl outcom and a reason balanc   given your dual object   of what is actual achiev in the circumst   as note previous  maintain your stanc for the near term would also be consist with the committe   s past behavior  as captur in our es  outcom base polici rule   similar  as shown in the panel to the right  op  control simul base on the extend  book project and an inflat object of   percent would call for hold the feder fund rate at it current level over the next sever quarter befor eas slight   while maintain the current stanc of polici  the committe might believ that the risk remain tilt to the upsid  as note at the bottom of the exhibit   the unemploy rate is below most es  of the nairu  suggest that labor market strain could be put upward pressur on price  and the committe may consequ be concern that inflat may not declin as in the staff   s outlook  moreov  with core inflat recent run around    to     percent  somewhat abov the prefer rang cite by some of you  the committe may continu to feel that risk manag consider argu for an assess that the risk remain tilt toward higher inflat  as in altern b   tabl   as it appear in the bluebook is includ as exhibit   for your refer  under the formul of altern b shown in this tabl  the committe would refer to the    substanti    cool of the hous market  indic that    the recent pace of growth appear to have been somewhat more subdu than anticip     but still conclud that    the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace on balanc over come quarter      this altern would retain paragraph   and   as they appear in the octob statement   if you found that version of section   too broad  you might prefer the version of altern b present in exhibit    shown in season appropri color    laughter   under this formul  in section   the    first sentenc and the second claus of the second sentenc would be ident to that present in the bluebook   howev  the first claus of the second sentenc would indic that    some recent indic of product and spend have been slight weaker than anticip      this formul may be seen as superior in that  first  it character recent indic without make a pronounc about overal growth for the fourth quarter and  second  it suggest that not all econom indic have been weak   both the exhibit   and the exhibit   version of altern b seem broad in line with market expect   thank you  mr  chairman
are there question for     presid
you report the declin in measur term premium  and yet in the panel next to that you note that measur of volatil don   t seem to have fallen   the term premium is  of cours  a combin of volatil in the secur return and covari with    let   s call it    margin util    just for the sake of argument   do your es  give you inform on whether that correl with the expect varianc of real outcom has chang
no  they realli don   t   the three factor term structur model  sn   t provid a breakdown  it  sn   t allow us to distinguish between chang in risk percept and risk appetit   so there   s no evid from that score   you may be see some reflect of what   s shown in the bottom left hand panel with that pronounc downward skew to interest rate   if investor believ that bond could prove to be a particular good invest  given the possibl of econom weak  they may actual demand a lower term premium becaus of the covari that you referenc   but i think we need to do more work on that befor we push hard on that analysi
my second question is about the statement   mani market particip  as you note  expect veri littl chang in the tenor of the statement   s character of the real economi   do you believ that the market would view the way altern b was origin   craft as express more concern than the median analyst about real weak  and do you view exhibit   as express less concern   as a more moder signal
in that respect i actual don   t see much distinct between   and    on the whole  my guess would be that it is not far from what the median market particip expect   dino may have a comment on this
i think that   s right   i think the median view would be that they   re look for some acknowledg of the soft data that were mention earlier
i have two question about the prism you gave us for look at the current stanc of polici and the like path of polici      in your comment on exhibit   you said that altern a  as your last bullet say     is consist with es  polici rule      can you just elabor on that   my quick read of it suggest that  as long as our inflat object is   percent  the rang of polici rule that we look at basic will show the fund rate at or under the market path   if you have a differ inflat object  then we   re at the middl of the distribut or mayb slight under the plausibl distribut   am i read that right
yes   in that comment i was refer specif to our es  polici rule  which are empir rendit of the committe   s past behavior   if you have the bluebook handi  in chart    right at the bottom under    memo     two polici rule are referenc   the es  outcom base rule and the es  forecast base rule   both of them show the feder fund rate in the vicin of    percent   if you look at the top part of that panel  be care to look at the correct version that we sent around late last week  a number of those rule suggest somewhat higher feder fund rate path   of cours  it depend on the inflat   object   an import distinct between the upper and lower part of that panel is that the lower part  sn   t have ani direct evid on what the committe   s inflat object is   so your question part get to what peopl would be expect if they had a specif inflat object in mind that is differ from what is incorpor in the upper part of the panel
my second question is about the bluebook chart    which show a rang of altern es  of the equilibrium real feder fund rate over  e  i want to come back to the chairman   s discuss about the save glut and what it might mean for the way we think about monetari polici today   the bottom panel of that chart show a substanti upward revis in most es  of equilibrium over the period from       to       and show us come back to someth close to our long term averag   is there an intuit explan for how you reconcil that chart with the preponder of evid out there  which the chairman drew to the world   s attent  that suggest you have a big increas in ex ant save relat to perceiv invest opportun   wouldn   t that have produc  in at least some mix of these es   a sustain and substanti secular declin in es  of current prevail equilibrium
i think the basic answer to that is    yes     but there are perhap thing go on here at a cyclic level and at a more structur level   chairman bernank   s hypothesi was more of a structur or a secular explan of interest rate   what we   re see in the upper panel of chart   obvious has import cyclic characterist with  among other thing  invest spend be depress for quit a while in the aftermath of the bubbl that appar prevail earlier
wouldn   t you have expect to have come back to a point that was below past es  of equilibrium over  e   i know i   m confus about this   laughter
i think there   s anoth offset thing that you can see in this chart  and that is trend product growth   if you look at the red band  you can see that it rose quit a bit in the late     s  when trend product growth rose   now we   re below the late      s with approxim the same trend product growth but appar much less invest demand relat to save   i think the chairman   s point offset the product
one way to look at this  i guess  is to say that we just don   t know much about what equilibrium is    laughter   it tend to move around a lot  and the band are kind of fat
they   re infer from a veri simpl model   veri limit three equat  five equat type es    we have one that we deriv from someth as complic as frb us  but the rest are just our look at real interest rate and output gap and tri to line them up   thus mani of the more structur explan are onli veri loos captur by these es
one point to make in that regard is that  to the extent you take a veri high articul model like frb us as a reason represent of the way the world work  it tell you that equilibrium real interest rate are determin by a broad rang of factor   there is no real presumpt that there is constant level to which it return over  e without consider of those exogen variabl
i have one final question in anoth direct   would you expect to see signific chang in measur term premium over short period   you gave   us a bunch of reason that you don   t have much confid in the model es   but would you ever want to attribut much to what look like signific move in short period
unless you have some reason for think that market particip    uncertainti about futur inflat pressur  spend  profit  and so forth or risk avers tend to chang rapid  i would say    no
presid   has a question
my recollect of the  e seri plot of these term premium es  from the origin research is that they were fair choppi on a short term basi   so this  sn   t seem wild and crazi
may i ask a question about languag that appli to two altern  or do you want to wait on that
both altern a and altern b talk in section   about someth happen that   s greater than anticip   i realli have some troubl with the word    than anticip      anticip by whom and about what   i recogn that the distinct between a and b and c is that c  sn   t emphas as much a diminut in the recent pace of growth   so that   s fine   but if you take the word    more    and    than anticip    out of both sentenc  you could make the same point for each one   i   m not look at the appropri christma color adapt of this    laughter
you   re correct   let me just put that on the tabl for peopl to comment on
you could take out    than anticip     and if you   re look at a  you could take out    more    becaus i think it say exact what you want to do   it put a littl more emphasi on growth and on problem affect growth  but it  sn   t rais issu about who anticip what and when
that   s a perfect fine point   i also just note that in exhibit    altern b  the word    pace    appear in both phrase   if we decid on that particular languag  i have a suggest rework that get rid of    pace    and has the same mean   but your substant point about whether or not to includ    than anticip    should be on the floor for peopl to consid
great   that   s where i want to put it   thank you
are there other question   presid pianalto
in your comment you say obvious that dealer expect no chang in the stanc of polici today   most expect littl chang to the word   yet their path for the fed fund rate is below what we see in the  book   what inform in your view would market need to move their path closer to the  book   s   what are they look for
well  i assum just general stronger real side data   as the committe has been discuss today  some firmer indic perhap that the downturn in hous is level out and that overal the economi is grow at a solid pace
as you point out  their econom forecast are alreadi much higher than our   the  book is one of the lowest in term of econom outlook  even those among the blue chip forecast
some disconnect between the privat forecast  the economist  and the bond market is evid   even in their assumpt it   s quit explicit   so i   don   t think those two thing are necessarili inconsist   are we readi to begin our polici round   presid hoenig
my prefer is  as we look at the outlook  to maintain the feder fund rate at    percent   in my judgment  mr  chairman  our current polici stanc is slight or moder restrict and will lead to moder in inflat go forward  though slowli i admit   but i will also say  as indic in my earlier statement  that i believ there are some upsid risk to such moder inflat   therefor  i believ that we should maintain a slight restrict polici stanc until we see core cpi inflat at   percent or lower   i would also say that my view of polici go forward is more asymmetr   if we get evid that inflat is not moder  i would be prepar to support addit tighten   on the other hand  it would take a prolong period of below trend growth with littl sign of a return to trend or a much larger slowdown in growth to convinc me that we should eas polici   on the press statement  i   m inclin toward say less than we   re say now   i still think we ought to leav more to the minut and say less in the statement   but have said that befor and not get veri far  i would go with altern b  more in line with some of the languag that you and cathi may work out here   thank
presid hoenig  do you prefer exhibit   or exhibit
you know  it   s a tough call  but i think i   d go with exhibit   languag
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i spoke of my concern about the fatten of the tail in econom weak and my continu concern about the alreadi fat tail of inflationari pressur  howev  if i come around to the view of the staff and the view that seem to be express by mani at this tabl   that growth is like to return to it long term potenti in the forecast period    inflat risk remain either at elev level or at less elev level  and liquid is somewher in the rang between healthi and ubiquit  laughter    then the first thing i do is decid that i wouldn   t want to increas rate but i also wouldn   t want to decreas them   the question is how we express ourselv   like presid hoenig   i don   t want to take word out of his mouth   i   d be happi if we just includ the open polici decis and then the assess of risk statement and took out much of the verbiag we have as a sort of christma surpris to the market  sinc they don   t expect a whole lot   but i know that   s not a serious propos   therefor  i come down on the side of altern b  as amend by the christma color   i   d take out the word    than anticip      i think presid   has a veri good point   and the duplic of the word    pace    that you point out   i worri  becaus i cannot make an argument for decreas the rate  about be care that we don   t signal to the market that we might be tend in that direct   although i think altern a not inaccur express what   s been said at this tabl  i worri that it may be send the wrong signal   therefor  i come down on the side  as presid hoenig    of altern b as amend by cathi and the suggest in the christma color  even though i think the verbiag is excess   i know that sound odd come from a texan
thank you veri much   my assess of what   s go on vis  vis our polici stanc is that we   re face  as i think most peopl have acknowledg around the tabl  pretti much the same idea that we were face at the last meet about the best baselin forecast go forward  but the risk on both side have gotten a littl deeper   on the growth side  the issu have to do with the depth of the hous market contract  the spillov to motor vehicl  and the possibl expans of weak to other sector  particular on the   good manufactur side   howev  i would mention  though nobodi els has around this tabl  that some of the slow in high tech spend seem to be relat to peopl   s wait to buy new comput when the new softwar from microsoft come out   i think that perhap a littl window of op  exist there  certain  it seem that way to our director who is in the semiconductor industri   you have some greater risk on the minus side  and you have all the risk that   talk about on the plus side   more accommod financi market  a dollar that   s declin  strength in labor market  and an eb of core inflat that   s still more of a possibl than a realiti   but i see the risk on both these side as not affect where polici should be   i don   t think the risk are unbalanc right now   they may have gotten a littl deeper on both side  but i don   t see them as unbalanc   this polici stanc is right  for now   i think it   s at the high end of neutral and focus on where it   s more expens to be wrong and that is on the inflat side   if inflat fail to deceler  if the promis is not realiz  then obvious polici won   t be slight restrict as it is now  and we   ll have to tighten   if we see some of the bad sign on the growth side confirm  then we   ll either need to stay the cours for a while  as presid hoenig has suggest  or possibl reduc rate along the line of the market   but for right now  we   re right where we need to be   i   d go with altern b   but i   d either go with the christma color with    than anticip    taken out  or as i am attract to presid hoenig   s idea  i   d go with fewer rather than more word   my prefer is to take section   from c and marri it to the rest of altern b   it has fewer word  and it  sn   t point specif to weak   presid   is right that a and b may be better descript of some of our worri around the tabl  but they could feed in a not necessarili good way into the market right now   section   in altern c would be a crisper  shorter way of not confirm the feder fund rate trajectori   that market see as they look forward   i   d rather not confirm that trajectori   so if i had my druther  i   d go with altern b with section   from altern c   otherwis  i   d take    than anticip    out and go with christma color on altern b
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i support an unchang fed fund rate target  howev  i strong favor a symmetr balanc of risk statement becaus i believ that we will then be well serv by market respons should incom data differ from our current expect   that was certain the case when long term interest rate fell after their june peak as the economi weaken   the committe has chosen not to act more forc against the current rate of inflat   which most  if not all  fomc particip believ is too high   becaus of the expect that inflat will declin over  e   i agre with that expect and support that polici   the market believ that it is unlik that we will be rais the fed fund rate target in the first half of next year   perhap the market   s expect is base sole on the view that we will not get bad inflat news   howev  judg from the lack of market respons to the pce price index report on novemb     which was higher than the market expect  the market believ that we will not act to rais the fed fund rate target dure the first half of next year even if we have more bad news on inflat   the reason is that the bad inflat data will elimin the market   s current expect of eas next year   under these condit  the ten year treasuri rate might rise over a period of eight to twelv week  say  by a total of    to     basi point  and the stock market might fall    or    percent   i   m guess the market believ that  if that happen  we would be unlik to rais the fed fund rate target   that is certain my view   suppos  on the other hand  that we see a combin of benign news on   inflat and weak news on the real economi   in such a situat  we should be delight if the market bid down the ten year bond rate   we should encourag that respons  and that is whi i favor a symmetr risk assess   do so   not impli that we are soft on inflat   the polici stanc depend on more than just the polici object function   polici stanc depend equal on the structur of the economi and the import object of pursu a polici that is as predict as possibl   if the committe adopt the risk statement in altern b  i ask that the minut explain that at least one member strong favor a balanc risk assess   i believ that the staff forecast make good sens and that the risk are symmetr on both side of that forecast  for both output and inflat   my posit would be captur by a section   someth like this     futur polici adjust will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  as impli by incom inform   the committe judg that risk to the inflat outlook remain the predomin concern      this languag express our concern about inflat but   not say that we are contempl a polici firm at our next meet or the meet after that   incident  the market inevit read ani hint about the fed fund rate target as appli primarili to the next meet   anyth after that will be supersed by the decis at the next meet   i take the posit i do not onli for it advantag should data on the real economi come in weaker than expect   suppos we experienc an inflat scare  includ signific depreci of the dollar on the foreign exchang   with the dollar and the stock market fall and with bond rate rise  would we want the market to conclud that our languag suggest polici firm in the futur  languag repeat at everi meet sinc the paus in rate increas in august  should now be taken serious   i believ that we would not   want the market to reach that conclus on the basi of languag craft for a differ purpos  we might want to send that messag  but we might not   in the middl of an inflat scare  take out that languag might be difficult   do so would impli that we are not consid a polici firm   yet we might be uncomfort leav it in becaus we might not believ a polici firm would be a good idea in the midst of market volatil   whi not avoid that potenti problem now   i also take the posit i do becaus i believ that our refer to polici firm is simpli not credibl   event might transpir that would make polici firm a live issu   but given the inform current in hand  i believ that it is improb that the committe would vote to rais the fed fund rate target in januari or march   is it good polici to advertis a polici that we do not expect to pursu   to put it anoth way  what condit would lead us to rais rate in januari or march   are those condit remot  or do they carri a nontrivi probabl   in sum  i am not argu for a relax view on inflat   inflat risk are  and should remain  our predomin concern   howev  i believ that a balanc risk statement  with an express of concern about inflat but without a hint of futur polici firm  will best serv us in the period between this meet and our januari meet and perhap beyond   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre that we should keep the feder fund rate where it is   i think that   s our best chanc of achiev various goal that we   ve all set here  relat to chang it in either direct   i do think the risk remain unbalanc   i   m in favor of keep the current section     i agre  bill  that the  book has a gradual reduct in inflat   it includ an impli assumpt of a flat feder fund rate and a rise in long term rate  not of    basi point but    rather  of about    basi point  i believ   that trend in inflat is still veri gradual relat even to the rise in long term rate embed in the  book   moreov  the risk around that trend  so long as the labor market remain as tight as they are  remain skew a littl to the upsid  and the cost of miss are larger if we miss to the upsid rather than if we miss to the downsid   so i   m veri comfort with continu to suggest not onli that we are focus on inflat but also that interest rate are more like to rise than to fall  given our focus on inflat   the market  sn   t believ it  but i think that   s where we are   mayb not in januari and i   m not sure about march  but i couldn   t rule an increas out under a plausibl set of inform   so i   m still veri comfort with section    and i think we ought to keep it until some other  e   as the statement evolv  we may get away from forecast our own action  we   ve been evolv in that direct   but we are where we are  and i think it would be not repres of where the committe is if we chang it at this point   i like the christma version of altern b   we do need to indic to the market and to the public that we are awar that some data have been just a touch   or  as governor   said  a smidgen   weaker than we anticip   i like the new version becaus it   home in on product and spend   by implic  the labor market haven   t been weaker than we anticip  so i think it   s a more accur represent   we realli haven   t   at least the staff hasn   t   revis down gdp growth veri much onc you take account of the auto distort   so i think this is more accur   i like the fact that it say    slight weaker    rather than the    somewhat    in the other altern b   i think that   s more repres   i could live without    than anticip      i was ask myself about    and spend had been slight weaker      that rais the question    than what      in truth  it is slight weaker than anticip  but the committe  sn   t have a record show exact what we   re anticip   it is slight weaker    if you think about the industri product data  than it was a few month ago   so i think it can stand without    than anticip      thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   i support maintain the current feder fund rate target today  and i can support the languag in altern b   i   m tri to decid between the holiday languag and the origin  and i   m struggl with the    weaker than anticip      so i agre that  if we remov it  i would be comfort with that assess   but i am also concern that our current risk assess languag is becom stale   back in august  when we first chose to paus  we were nervous that our next move was go to be up and that inflationari pressur could intensifi   we thought it was critic to tell the public that we would be readi to resum rais the fed fund rate if our outlook requir us to do so   i myself was more than half expect that such would be the case   but the incom data sinc august have not alter the  book baselin project for the next year  and so i   m less worri today than i was in august that we will have to do more on the upsid on the fed fund rate   today is not the day to remov that languag or chang that languag   but if we believ that the path of the fed fund rate in the  book is the one that is like to evolv  we should start to prepar market for our maintain the current feder fund rate longer than they current expect   becaus they expect us to move down   so i would rather start to craft some languag that would signal to market that we   re like to stay at our current fed fund rate longer and  depend on how the economi unfold  that we may eventu be more restrict than we appear to be today   i agre that today is not the  e to chang our languag signific  so i support altern b
thank you   first vice presid barron
thank you  mr  chairman   i feel that current polici is about right  given the risk to the economi and the potenti that inflat will not turn down in the near term  thus i would favor no chang at this  e   we   ll get further read on employ befor our next meet  and we   ll also know about the level of spend that is like to occur over the holiday   although it   s doubt that we   ll have a clear read in januari on the futur direct of hous  the addit data will perhap provid us with some clue as to how long and how deep the downturn will be for this sector   the longer the downturn in the hous sector continu  the greater the potenti for spillov into other sector  creat the potenti for some eas in the relat tight labor market that we   ve all talk about today   that said  my own take is that  without some signific spillov  we should be on track for a soft land   as far as the word is concern  i   m not sure how mani option we   ve got on the tabl  but i would prefer altern b  drop the    more than anticip      i   d be a littl cautious about introduc a new phrase  whether it   s product or spend  becaus we might have to specifi what spend   i think we   re talk implicit about busi spend  but we have to rememb that the consum sector has held up quit nice for us   so let me just stop   i prefer altern b in exhibit    and i would drop    more than anticip
mr  chairman
i have a clarifi question rais by pat   s question  pleas remind us  dave   has real consum spend slow more than anticip
no   real household consumpt has been exact as expect and has not shown ani sign yet of slow   busi spend  on the other hand  has been slow in equip and somewhat in construct
the spend side of the nation incom and product account is realli the unspoken implic
the other differ between exhibit   and   is    weaker    versus    subdu           subdu    sound weaker than    weak       laughter   or is    weak    weaker than    subdu
mayb michell can tell us the answer to that    laughter
i still vote for section   of altern c
presid   has a clean solut   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the paus initi back in august is pay dividend   we   ve been abl to gather valuabl econom intellig at no discern cost to fomc credibl   given the recent sign of weak in econom activ  i do think the downsid risk to the outlook has intensifi   a further rate increas at this  e would unnecessarili increas the odd of a much sharper and more damag econom slowdown   even though inflat has shown some sign of moder  the risk to a gradual declin in inflat remain clear bias to the upsid   weigh these two risk  i still see inflat as the predomin risk  and therefor  like governor kohn  i am comfort with the risk assess in section   as it stand  i think we   re enter a critic phase for polici   inflat may not come down as desir  and a further rate increas may be need or  hard as it is to imagin  market particip may end up be right that the economi will slow much fa  than we anticip and call for rate cut   we need to be in a posit to react quick and flexibl to chang  whatev the circumst may be  and i think altern b accomplish that becaus it accur reaffirm our concern regard inflat while it leav our option open    with respect to languag  my first choic  like presid     s  would be to use the languag for section   in altern c   it omit ani refer to recent data or to what we anticip and simpli add the word    substanti     which i regard as a nod to recent data that suggest a greater slow in hous   my second choic for section   would be to use the substitut languag in the christma color exhibit     i also support presid     s suggest to omit ani refer to what was anticip becaus i agre with her and with the point that presid pool made befor our meet   that refer to differ from what was anticip simpli rais the question of who form the anticip  what the anticip was  and when it was form   in addit  i think it   s a bit mislead becaus  although some recent data on the spend side have been weaker than we may have anticip  we   ve also had data from the labor market that have been stronger than we anticip   so i fear that altern b  section    leav the fals impress that we have signific revis downward both our view of the outlook for growth and  accord  our es  of inflat risk
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i want to thank the staff for includ chart   in the bluebook   as sever of us suggest last  e  it   s a good addit to have for everi meet  sinc august  polici has been on hold for us to assess the inflat situat and the growth outlook  and at this point i think we would continu the period of assess until the situat is clarifi further or someth chang   today i would go with altern b   listen to the discuss  i still come down for the word in altern b   i would go with exhibit    which is the christma color version  and i would delet    than anticip      i think it   read better that way   don  in answer to your question  i think the market would read this as be slight weaker   than histori   so i think that   s appropri   i can see the argument for altern c   it is much cleaner  and it relat direct to what we said last  e  with a slight modif   howev  there has been a slight weak in the data  and i think it   s realiti  and we should recogn it   in term of whether    weaker    is weaker than    subdu      actual the word are    somewhat more subdu    and    slight weaker      laughter   on that basi  i   m comfort with    slight weaker      howev  step back dure this period  i think it is use to consid the kind of inform that would lead us to chang the polici rate  as sever peopl have talk about here   when we assess the inflat situat  although member of this committe may have differ view of price stabil  i think there   s a clear consensus that core inflat has been too high   in our decis to paus  too  there   s a consensus that we can be patient  at least for now  about the  e frame for core inflat to fall   the question is     how patient      we expect that inflat will gradual come down  but the corollari to this is that core inflat should not notic deterior over the near term   in the medium term  we should be more clear on a path to lower inflat   of cours  steadi progress would be best  but what we all want is at least to be on the path   the implic is that we must be will to firm polici if core inflat increas in the near term or the medium term or if it fail to be on a clear trend toward price stabil over the longer term  when we look at the growth side for the longer term  i think the consensus view is that we want to care monitor growth and resourc slack  be mind of the downsid econom risk that we talk about and the chairman summar   we talk about the bimod economi  but we also must rememb that sustain growth rate are like lower   the  book talk about     percent  a lower number than what we   ve been accustom to in recent year  and the implic is that we could be face increas resourc pressur at gdp growth rate that were previous view as below potenti    so the bottom line is no chang in polici today   inflat risk still predomin   i   m nervous about the expect slow improv in inflat  but i admit that the juri is still out on whether it   s a problem   the econom fundament still suggest a return to potenti growth rate by the end of        but we have to be mind of the advers chang in the growth outlook as well
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i take my cue from the earlier observ that we have receiv a lot of addit data but not much addit inform  and i agre with it  so  first of all  i favor no chang in the feder fund rate   i think that has been appropri for a while  and i think it continu to be appropri   as far as languag under altern b is concern  i must admit that some of the discuss is perhap over nuanc for me   but come down to a choic  i would prefer some version of section   from exhibit    take out the phrase    more than anticip      i don   t want to get into a debat about exact what spend encompass or  sn   t encompass from the version in exhibit     i agre with those who have alreadi comment that the data have turn out to be a bit softer than we expect and  i think  than was general expect   we should acknowledg that  i mean  let   s not pretend that it hasn   t occur  so with that  i   ll end my remark
presid  n  are you advoc exhibit   about growth as oppos to exhibit   with the indic
thank you   presid
in past meet i have express my misgiv about whether our strategi is go to bring inflat down fast enough   so i won   t belabor those again today   as i said earlier today  the inflat pictur has  if anyth  erod a bit   so my misgiv remain   the   outlook for real growth could conceiv weaken enough to alter my perspect on the fed fund rate  but that hasn   t happen yet   the data on manufactur and nonresidenti construct were margin wors than expect  but they haven   t fundament alter my assess nor  i take it  the assess of mani other that the current weak is transitori rather than high persist  i still think the economi could theoret handl a margin higher fed fund rate   i   m also mind of the appar wide gap between the assess of the market and what i believ to be the consensus around the tabl   in that context  i   m unwil to signal that my concern about the trajectori of core inflat has diminish or to alter the general cast of the announc regard inflat   thus  i favor altern c   howev  on the off chanc that the committe prefer altern b   laughter  i   d suggest that exhibit   is better than exhibit   on altern b  section    i   d also associ myself with the view of presid   and   that altern c  section    would be prefer to either   but i don   t even know if i have a say on that kind of thing   laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  favor maintain the feder fund rate at it current level at this point   as mani peopl have said  the incom data have been volumin but not veri inform   howev  inflat continu to be higher than i   d like to see it and is forecast to remain so for longer than i   d like to see  thus put our credibl at risk   i am more op ist than the  book about the possibl for a quicker rebound to potenti   but even if you take the staff   s  book forecast  with growth expect to be below trend for at least sever more quarter befor return to trend  i   m comfort with maintain the current feder fund rate and the implicit firm that do so would impli as the economi slow down    although i don   t think we should rais the fed fund rate today  i do want to put on the tabl and reemphas  as sever peopl have  that we need to acknowledg that if real growth rebound quicker toward trend than is current forecast  whether in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of next year  then we must be in a posit to rais the fed fund rate at that  e   i happen to put more probabl on that be the case than perhap some do   a failur to do that or to signal that we will do that would put consider upward pressur on the inflat outlook and on the public   s percept of our commit to price stabil   of cours  if we begin to see much larger spillov from hous correct or from other sector  which i don   t think we will  we may want to allow the nomin fund rate to declin as the equilibrium market rate declin   again  not to exploit a phillip curv type of tradeoff but to drive the real rate down at the appropri  e   but that would also be signal that we are content with the current level of inflat  and i don   t think we are at this point   so i don   t think that   s realli in the card   given the outlook  i see not much to be gain and much to be lost from lower the fed fund rate  as mani peopl have indic  in regard to the languag  i lean toward altern b  but i must confess i   m still a novic at the nuanc of some of this languag stuff  and i go back and forth   i am sympathet to the view express by presid   and to bill pool   s comment about the word    than anticip     but i am concern about section    and i have some mix emot about it   it seem to me that the way section   is current be constru is a bit asymmetr   presid   was make this point   we talk about the weak that we   ve seen  and then we make a comment that say     but we expect growth to be moder      that seem to me to be an asymmetr treatment of what we   ve realli been talk about   if we   re go to be explicit about where we   ve seen weak  then we also ought to be explicit about whi we still see growth as be moder becaus otherwis you see onli one side of the coin   whether we talk about strength in the labor market or   strength in consum spend  it seem to me that we need to balanc the statement  otherwis the section  sn   t make a lot of sens to me  now  as i think through that  i becom more and more attract to presid hoenig   s view that mayb the less we say the better becaus say more requir more explan   in general  i have somewhat mix feel about the languag issu   i tend to think that we ought to chang the languag of the statement more often rather than less often becaus put in a new word is alway excruci pain and understand the nuanc of what we   re tri to convey to the market is veri difficult   one altern is to be much more eclect about what we say and either use the minut to explain it further or not   i don   t know that i would necessarili advoc do that  but i think that we need to think about use the languag in the statement in way that perhap don   t lock us into thing in the way the languag current     that   s my observ   thank you  mr  chairman
presid    the communic subcommitte will help us solv that problem    laughter   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i support leav the rate unchang today becaus i still believ that the risk are to the upsid on inflat and so we need to persever at this level for a while   in term of the word  i want to offer anoth altern    laughter   i   m concern that in exhibit    altern b  we   ve ad    substanti    to hous and have note weaker indic  yet the view around the tabl   and clear my own view   is that the indic have been mix  a lot of strength is still show   consum spend look good   employ look good   if we want to talk about indic  i would prefer some word that deal with presid     s comment and say that    although recent econom indic have been mix  the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace on balanc over the come quarter    becaus that   s what we   re   realli say   there   s some good news and there   s some bad news   by focus just on the negat  i think we are signal that we   re more concern about a slowdown   i at least think that is inconsist with a tilt of risk toward inflat   so i would do someth along that line or go back to exhibit    which basic just recogn that in the aggreg the economi has slow a bit  but i   m uncomfort with address onli the weak and not the strength
let me put in anoth plug for section   of altern c      econom growth has slow over the cours of the year  part reflect a substanti cool of the hous market      whi do you want to go on and on about it
that   s what we   re paid to do    laughter
let me just say what the logic is behind it   the logic is that we   d like the market to know that we are awak   laughter  we are watch the data  we have seen thing come across the transom  but nevertheless  we have the follow view   perhap the logic is not good  but that   s the reason
i can understand the logic  but i wonder whether    substanti      that enough for us   that   s the onli question i would pose
okay   thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  favor no chang in the feder fund rate today and agre on the risk assess in section     let me make three point   first  i think that there is a rebutt presumpt   particular in decemb  given what   s go on in the market   of somewhat less liquid and somewhat less interest in surpris now than at other point that favor fewer chang rather than more   second  i think your remark  mr  chairman  the vice chairman   s remark  and sever peopl   s remark over the intermeet period have focus   on uncertainti and have tri to challeng the market about their degre of certitud regard what   s like to happen   when i review the languag  i tri to keep that in mind and reinforc the view that they need to be do their own homework and to be think about what the tail risk are  third  it   s not our job to forc our forward curv of interest rate to match the market  but i   d rather not reinforc their view either  so when i turn to the languag  my prefer is to agre with presid     s altern c   but we   ve been whisper about governor bie   s compromis over here  and just to make the word even briefer  a suggest for the word is     although recent indic are mix  the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace on balanc over come quarter     this word acknowledg what   s go on in the market  mr  chairman  and so it captur what you right said about our continu to pay attent rather than have a knee jerk reaction   at the same  e  it  sn   t put more of an emphasi on data on either side of the line   that strike me as a reason compromis  given all that i   ve heard today   thank you
thank you   governor
given that the avalanch hasn   t realli move our assess veri much  i certain don   t see ani reason to move interest rate now   i think it is import to acknowledg in section   some of the slow that we   ve seen   as we have discuss  there are two way to do that   one is to includ the substanti cool of hous   i think there   s consensus for that   i haven   t heard anyth said to the contrari   and i think it   s import that we do have that  then the question is whether we want to go further and whether we can do that clear  rather than caus confus   obvious  the simpl option is just to cut it all out   take the   approach and say    substanti    is suffici   as governor   mention  we   ve been think about a simplifi version of altern b that mention just some    recent indic      then we can get out   of the discuss of product  spend  and the specif   but i do think that   s better than say    growth      it   s also better to talk about some of the indic rather than just the overal growth number  which was in exhibit     so i think exhibit   is better that way   then it   s a nuanc whether we want to includ    somewhat subdu        slight weaker     or    mix     and whether we use    were        have been     or    are      i   m not quit sure exact where i stand on all of those  but i do think that simplifi the languag to some degre and just say someth about indic would be the way to go
thank you   governor
given the discuss today  there realli is no reason to chang our stanc in polici or chang my view on polici   there is a bit more uncertainti  so i think the word    vigil    is import   then we need to be abl to move quick  and it   s not clear to me that we are necessarili talk about quick in term of lower interest rate  we might have to rais interest rate   so i think we just have to be awar of that  i am comfort with the current assess of risk   i think it would be a mistak to move it now  which i don   t think anybodi is suggest  and it   s not clear to me that it wouldn   t be a bad idea go forward   even if we have inflat declin  we   re in a situat in which we actual want to allow real rate to go up   in that sens  the assess of risk as it is current state say exact that   if we chang the assess of risk to be more balanc  the market may react and think we   re get softer on inflat   so i am comfort keep it this way   even though it   s not on the tabl today  it would take a lot more for me to want to chang it  on the issu of languag  i guess i want to use the smidgen principl   my view is that thing have not realli chang veri much   there   s a smidgen of weak   again  the nuanc of this stuff are not my thing   i   m like presid   in that we   re sort of newbi   but the basic   principl here is the less we chang  the better it is   there   s the issu about whether altern c would work by say just    substanti      that actual   indic that we   re awar that thing have gotten a littl softer  so i would be comfort with presid     s suggest   but i   m also not uncomfort with just shorten exhibit    which say also that some recent indic have been mix  period   i   m not sure which one of those is better  but i think the key idea here is that we don   t want to chang these a whole lot   we just want to acknowledg that  in fact  thing have been slight softer but the chang is not a big deal   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
may i begin with a question   when was the last  e we use the phrase    indic have been mix      is there preced for that
i thought you were go to ask about    smidgen       laughter
in the past the committe has often refer to    intermeet data     for exampl
as be mix   it   s probabl true that at ani  e the indic are mix  but   this phrase have substanti connot base on preced
i don   t think so
all right   my basic view  mr  chairman  is that we should keep the fed fund rate unchang   circumst justifi a veri modest soften of the signal in the statement   i don   t think we should do that by chang the balanc of risk assess  i think we should do it by acknowledg veri subt that thing have turn out slight softer than perhap we expect and that we might have a littl more uncertainti go forward   the virtu of governor bie   s suggest is that it acknowledg uncertainti  and the combin of the acknowledg that the downturn in hous has been substanti and the phrase indic some   uncertainti about the futur is pretti good   so i   d be comfort with that   presid pool made a veri good case for the import of remind ourselv that we need to make sure we have some flexibl go forward to react to a materi chang in the outlook   but i don   t think we   ve had enough chang to our outlook to justifi a substanti chang in the signal at this point   to go to a balanc risk assess or to go substanti further toward one would like induc some larger chang in market expect and some greater eas of financi condit than we have alreadi seen   that is not someth we need to induc at this  e  princip becaus of our uncertainti about whether we   re go to get enough moder in inflat   so i would be comfort with    recent indic have been mix      i think i   d slight prefer that to go to altern c  section    and i would prefer both of those to altern b in either exhibit
mr  chairman  i think we have just been to north dakota    laughter
i would say we cross the border    laughter   well  let me tri to summar    laughter   first of all  the economi is still on the cours that we have been project for some  e   a soft land scenario with some slow but  i hope  decid reduct in inflat seem to be a reason expect   howev  there still are signific uncertainti in the forecast  and we   re quit awar of that   i note parenthet that it   s a good thing that the bond market aren   t simpli parrot our statement   they   re provid their own take  and we should use that inform and not necessarili consid it a failur if their view are distinct from our   so sinc the situat seem to be on trajectori  i would advoc today not chang the feder fund rate  with respect to the statement  we did tri in the first iter to make some chang to the assess of risk   i have some sympathi with presid pool   s view in that  read liter  our   assess of risk admit no possibl that our next move will be down  which i don   t think could be true under ani circumst   howev  we have been use this languag for a while   we have been clear in our minut that we do see some downsid risk to output   the market  i think  has understood whose statement we are tri to emphas  our particular concern about inflat  and our willing to rais rate if inflat  sn   t moder signific   again  although i   m sympathet to presid pool and i   m tri to think about how we are go to move away from this languag into other form of languag  i think  along with vice chairman    that our chang the risk assess today would send a veri strong signal that our discuss has not suggest   that   s whi i propos to leav the risk assess unchang for today but to take on board the concern that presid pool has rais about get it to a perhap more accur descript of our risk assess and expect  on section    the two suggest that i think have command some signific support are  first  presid     s suggest of use the second section under altern c and  second  the altern in the christma tree color use    although recent indic have been mix    in the present perfect tens      although recent indic have been mix  the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace on balanc over come quarter      i think those are the two that peopl have prefer   i don   t think it make a great deal of differ  frank  but i lean person a bit toward includ the refer to indic onli on the ground of tri to signal to the market again that we are watch the data  that we are awar of develop in the economi  and that we   re not just take the statement out and put a new date on it   so that would be my recommend   that we use the phrase    although recent indic have been mix  the economi seem like to expand     and so on   i   d be happi to take comment
that   s fine
is there a comment
i   ll be read the direct and risk assess from page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent     then     nonetheless  the committe judg that some inflat risk remain   the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need to address these risk will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  as impli by incom inform     chairman bernank  vice chairman    governor bie governor kohn   governor    presid    governor   presid pianalto   presid pool  governor   presid

i was go to say that i   m the onli one here  on the committe anyway  who get there with ani frequenc  and peopl have suggest that i should defend north dakota  but i must say that i felt the joke was apt    laughter
get back to other communic issu  i have  first  a bit on the januari meet   our januari meet will be anoth two day meet  and part of it will be on communic issu   this one will be on forecast   what can we do to improv the way we communic our outlook about the economi   realli the medium term outlook   and how it fit into our explan of monetari polici action   the focus is not so much on how we would use this to signal our price stabil object  which we will come back to in march   obvious  the two consider are close relat  but the focus will realli be on the forecast process and how we can do it better and communic about it better   three set of background materi are in prepar       a memorandum from intern financ on foreign experi with forecast      a memo from research and statist on some of the choic avail to us   the variabl  condit assumpt  period  and thing like that  and     a memo from monetari affair on the interact of these various choic with the govern of the committe   that is  who own the forecast and the explan  move on to the memo that you receiv from the subcommitte on communic   as you know from that memo  sever committe member thought it would be use at this meet to have at least a brief discuss about how we as individu talk in public about the subject of ongo deliber on communic issu   i includ myself in that list of peopl who thought that this discuss would be use  without necessarili implic the other member of the subcommitte   we are concern that our individu public statement could imped our abil to reach intern consensus and to control how whatev that consensus turn out to be is   communic to the public   i think that find consensus on some of these issu is go to take consider flexibl and give and take among committe member   one concern is that the more individu sort of pre announc their posit  particular in public  the harder it   s go to be to find that consensus around the tabl   we are in this process   there   s no need to push the committe toward do someth   the committe is do someth  and i think we need to keep all our individu option open as we go forward   anoth problem is communic with the public   one of my concern is that statement by individu about their particular posit risk confus the public about where we might come out  set up inaccur expect of where we   re come out  and provok reaction in the public about someth that the committe might not be do   whatev we come up with  the committe and the chairman are go to have to keep close control on how we roll it out to the public and how we tell peopl what we   re do and whi   no one should be or can be expect to repudi his or her past posit   say  on comfort zone   but we can think about not elev the topic  not bring it up so much ourselv  not push it further in public while the committe is deliber  we sent this memo realli to get committe reaction   to be effect  we need a consensus on this issu among the committe member   and i would includ the staff sit around the edg of the room   to control our public statement on this issu   if some of us do it and other don   t  it isn   t go to work   so i would be interest in your reaction   thank you  mr  chairman
i agre   i can   t imagin put a posit out in public   i   m concern that i do get question      this has been in the minut   what do you think      i feel a littl uncomfort just say     i   m not go to talk to you about that      i feel more comfort say     that   s a tough issu   we   ve gone back and forth   we need to think it through   there are strong view      i   mean to talk about it a bit without put a big posit out there   i just don   t want to say to them     i   m not talk about this      it sound incomplet or half bake
i would not interpret tom   s    no comment on the issu    to be inconsist with what you were propos  don
right   i think we can talk about it without give a posit   i mean  when peopl have ask me  i   ve said     there are a number of thing under consider   there are a lot of issu here that we need to work through
i feel veri comfort without give out     this is what we ought to do     and that sort of thing   that   s help
i think there   s a fine line here   it   s extrem import for us not to be take posit  exact along the line that have been suggest   but there is a question about educ the public about the issu  not about the specif   becaus of the fine line  i   m not sure how we should think about this question   whatev we decid  at some point we don   t want to just spring it on the public  for obvious reason   there is a role for communic in term of educ the public about the issu  mani of which we have been discuss   for exampl  in speech about the import of anchor inflat expect   now  how we communic that is actual one of the issu that we have to discuss   have the public understand what monetari polici is about is veri import in term of the educ process  and yet we also need to make sure that we are not get into ani detail   so there   s a fine line here   it might be interest to hear from other particip about how we can achiev get the public to understand what monetari polici is realli about  which a lot of the public  sn   t  and yet not actual creat expect that we   re go to go one way or anoth in term of communic   we certain don   t want to cut off this discuss  which has been ongo between the feder reserv and the   public   actual quit success   it   s amaz when you look where the public was ten year ago versus where they are now  and it   s becaus of the speech  articl  and other written communic that the system has been do quit success
i   d just like to point out that we can respond to question by point to the brief mention in the minut that the committe has been talk about communic issu   we can also remind peopl that the detail of the proceed are confidenti until they are releas in the minut  the statement  tes oni  and eventu the transcript      not at liberti    is a standard respons have to do with all the deliber around this tabl   the onli other thing i would add is that some of us have been on record for a long  e   so when i get question about inflat target  i say that the first speech i made outsid st  loui  when i came to the st  loui fed  includ some discuss of that issu  and i repeat what i said eight year ago and leav it at that
i   d just like to echo both of those point  which make this issu in some way much more subtl and difficult to pull off   i agre with       percent   part of our job here is educ   we have to walk the line between talk about the subtleti of monetari polici and issu that confront us and educ the public  becaus the last thing we want to do is to clam up about monetari polici to such an extent that the public  sn   t get educ and  sn   t understand what we   re do and whi   so it is import that we bring them along with us to some degre as we talk about it   the other point that i would reinforc is what bill said   mani of us are on record as have point of view on some of these issu  and we can   t just deni that those exist
let me say just a few thing   first of all  the freedom of individu member to speak is a veri import valu   we are not tri in ani way to suppress   that   second  i agre with governor   that the educ process is veri import   third  i would say that past posit are past posit  and no one is ask anyon to repudi anyth  i think the respons of presid hoenig is perfect appropri   to acknowledg the issu  to acknowledg the argument on both side  and to acknowledg even your own past posit   the onli point is to avoid activ take strong  specif posit on particular issu that are realli up for debat in the committe   i think that we as a committe would agre  for exampl  that good communic is veri import and that there are argument on both side of inflat target  but  as governor kohn said  we do want to make sure that the atmospher within the committe is conduc to get agreement   then i and other will have to explain this to the congress and other  and we want to make sure that they haven   t heard differ posit that  in fact  do not reflect what we come out with   so pleas don   t overst what we   re discuss here   i mean  we   re not ask for anyth like    mum   s the word     but simpli request that you have some perspect on the vigor with which you advoc specif posit over the next few month  presid
actual  i think vice chair   was slight ahead of me
no  go ahead
thank you   i think don   s and your point  mr  chairman  are veri well made   come at this mayb from a littl differ perspect than a lot of peopl do  i think there   s a lot we can say about what the committe has alreadi done in the realm of communic   the big watersh was in        in actual tell peopl what we were do  you can say a lot that is posit   for exampl  the  eli with which we bring the minut out  also  i can   t see that peopl have difficulti understand that we have issu left to resolv   if peopl ask a question about communic  we can say that we   ve taken realli major step and   that we   re contempl what more we should do to meet the object of monetari polici better  so my own view is that  no matter where you stand on this subject  you have a solid track record of committe action to talk about without even get into inflat target
let me just say a coupl of thing   i think     s point about educ is right   you can make a statement educ peopl about the virtu of price stabil and anchor long term inflat expect and the reason that   s import  without take on the challeng of educ peopl today about altern way of achiev that object   our debat about inflat target and communic is realli about mean not end  and my view about educ on the latter issu about mean is to avoid take on the challeng of educ the public until we know where we want to go   onc we know where we want to go  we can figur out how best to creat the broader public foundat to make that possibl   i   m sure that we   ll have differ view on that  my second point is about past posit   this is easi for me becaus i don   t have past posit about these issu to echo or to repudi in public   i would make a slight differ suggest for the way to respond to those question from  i think  bill   you can refer peopl to your past posit without repeat them in substanc and nuanc   i don   t know what the chairman and the vice chairman of the board plan to do  but i expect that you won   t feel the need in public go forward to repeat your past posit on these issu   i suspect that you will refer peopl to your past posit without remind them about what those were   that distinct is import  i think  becaus i don   t know how you get into repeat or summar your past posit without inevit get into the broader set of choic that we   re go to be debat in the committe    one final point  and i think don said this more eloqu than i can say it  which is that we all have an interest in have this discuss take place below the radar screen of public debat until  again  we have a better sens of where consensus is go to lie   the more we move it into the public debat  the more risk we face of all the concern that governor kohn refer to
just veri quick  i think what   s clear from this discuss is that  in deal with the issu of inflat target  there   s no need to be on the offens   the issu is how we handl the defens   and i think vice chairman     s point is correct   if we talk about the end and desir of monetari polici rather than get into the mean   as you know  mr  chairman  after the last discuss i was veri worri about what was sent around in the first draft of the minut   i think presid   was as well   even about what we end up say in the minut   so  again  my view is that the less said  the better   if we are on the defens  i would urg everybodi just to stress the fact that the topic is under discuss and no decis has been made and tri to make it as simpl and as quick as possibl
thank you   let   s bring this discuss to an end   everyon has to use his or her own judgment  but we just want to bring to your attent some of these consider as you think about your public appear   the date of the next meet is januari    and      the meet is now adjourn  end of meet
