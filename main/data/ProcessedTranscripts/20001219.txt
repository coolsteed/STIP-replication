would somebodi like to move approv of the minut for the novemb   th meet
so move  speaker      second
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to a packag of chart with a peach or salmon cover that should be in front of you   the first page depict deposit rate on forward contract   u s  current and forward rate have move lower sinc the last fomc meet  most notic in a seri of step   the first such step was on novemb   th  follow the releas of the durabl good data  the next was on decemb  th  follow chairman  span s speech to the communiti banker group  and rate move down again at the end of last week follow the releas of the ppi and cpi   the current   month rate is now less than   basi point over the committe s target fed fund rate  and the   month forward   month rate is now    basi point under the current   month rate   euro deposit rate have also move lower sinc your last meet  follow rough the same pattern and  e as the declin in dollar rate   in addit to move down after the releas of the durabl good order data and after the chairman s speech on friday  decemb  th  they also fell last week  the latter move was in conjunct not onli with the releas of the cpi but also the report of the sixth consecut month declin in the german ifo survey of busi confid   while the differenti have narrow somewhat becaus of the larger declin in the dollar  they remain rather consider in the dollar s favor   the differenti in the current   month rate is still     basi point   in the   month and   month forward rate the differenti are     basi point and more than     basi point  respect   as for japan  deterior sen ent about the japanes economi is not obvious reflect in the forward rate shown in the bottom    a copi of the chart use by mr    is append to this transcript  appendix      panel  which at first glanc appear to be tread water   howev  i think the converg of the   month forward and the   month forward rate in the last few week   reflect an unwind of the modest hope for an acceler economi over the next year   the current   month yen deposit rate has tick up on fund pressur  reflect the combin of the bank of japan s new payment system  launch at the begin of the year  and the normal fiscal year end financ requir associ with the first calendar quarter  which is their last fiscal quarter   in the top panel of the next page you can see movement in the u s  treasuri yield curv  with the   year note in red  the    year note in blue  and the    year bond in     these yield have move down in rough the same pattern as the forward rate  with the rate on    and    year note have come down by just less than    basi point each sinc your last meet   in the bottom panel i ve depict the differenti between dollar and euro swap rate  the   year differenti in red and the    year in blue  the dramat narrow of the latter sinc the chairman s speech to the communiti banker has been explain as reflect expect of a more pronounc slow in the u s  economi as compar with europ   while that percept is around  focus on the    year sector seem to me to overst the chang in the relat outlook   if there had been a sharp diverg in growth expect  one might have expect to see a bit more of it reflect in the   year rate   while the   year differenti has narrow by about    basi point sinc your last meet  that is consider less than the narrow of    basi point in the    year differenti   the explan i have been offer by market particip is that the pronounc fall in    year swap rate reflect the need of those who manag mortgag portfolio and have to extend their portfolio s durat as interest rate declin in order to hedg prepay risk   and with thin treasuri market  these portfolio manag increas look to agenc secur and the swap market as addit sourc of liquid to complet their hedg   in effect  the more pronounc narrow of the    year swap differenti reflect the greater extent to which the agenc financ of the hous stock is mark to market on a daili basi here in north america as compar with europ   two year rate may yet prove to be a lag indic  or the short end of our yield curv may yet declin by more than the market now expect   but as long as the   year differenti remain over     basi point in the dollar s favor  it is hard for me to think that market particip are expect mark diverg growth path for europ and north america    on page   i ve provid a set of chart on yield curv similar to the chart i show you at the last meet  this  e with addit of the bb  industri corpor index   at the upper left is the yield curv as of may   th  the day the committe last rais rate   the upper right panel show yield just after your novemb   th meet   the lower left panel is for novemb   th  after the releas of the durabl good order data  and the lower right one is for decemb   th  after the cpi releas   look from the upper right to the lower right  compar rate at the end of the day of your last meet to today  you can see that the u s  treasuri yield curv has move notic lower   one might say that the    to    year curv now hover around the central tendenc of       percent      basi point under the fund rate   the swap curv over that matur rang has been pull complet below the fund rate  and   year a  industri corpor paper yield the same as the overnight rate  the bb  yield have move appreci lower  by    basi point in the         and    year matur sinc the  e of your last meet   now  with the short end outperform the long end and the better credit outperform the lesser credit at the long end  what seem to me to be happen is that veri differ set of concern in the market at the moment are converg in term of investor behavior   from whatev their differ start point  investor are tend to shorten durat and move into the higher qualiti credit   those who expect a pronounc and endur slowdown of activ expect a consider eas of monetari polici and thus are posit themselv to enjoy a ralli in the short end of the yield curv   those who think the current slowdown may onli be a paus are concern about the potenti volatil of gdp and thus are tend to reduc their durat in order to minim their exposur to the long end   those who are concern about corpor earn strain and deterior credit qualiti are fear of corpor event risk and are reduc the matur of their credit exposur while shift into better credit   those who have finish their risk take for the year becaus they have a suffici of either gain or loss  have posit themselv into the short end while they await next year   s opportun   as the short end of the curv and the better credit across the curv have ralli  the hedg by mortgag portfolio manag has acceler the movement down   on the other side are those who think that interest rate  or at least some portion of the    to    year curv  are at or near their bottom becaus the soft land will be achiev   in their view ani paus in activ will be quit brief or may even be over   these account have been content to sell treasuri secur and swap contract to the eager buyer   implicit in this view is the intrigu idea that the market has   not onli led the fed but that the market has lap the fed   even as they expect the committe to lower short term rate  they expect longer term rate to be steadi or rise   all of these view are usual reduc to the simpl dichotomi between those who expect a hard land and those who expect a soft one   on the one hand are those who anticip a pronounc weak in demand and a deterior of credit  and on the other are those who think activ will stabil or pick up and that credit spread will normal onc we pass through the typic year end season risk avers   turn to page    you can see some extraordinari movement in the commerci paper market   in the top chart are spread of a  p     day commerci paper over the a  p  paper for all borrow  financi and nonfinanci  from septemb through februari of each year sinc        in the bottom chart are compar data for    day commerci paper   in both case the heavi red line repres those spread over the period sinc septemb of this year   clear  the pattern in      is outsid the rang of recent experi  reflect someth more than normal risk avers associ with the window dress of year end balanc sheet   in talk to those in the commerci paper market  one   not get a sens of crisi in the a  p  market   but there is a rather strong sens of satur of higher risk asset   portfolio that might have carri a  p  paper through the year end have more than their fill of telecom paper and other paper  whether long term or short term  of question credit qualiti   and there is this wonder notion in the market that event risk is somehow differ from credit risk   it seem to me that event risk is credit risk that they didn   t anticip or didn   t price  but they d rather not admit that to their superior   clear  the sharp of the jump in the    day spread is a function of the term roll through the turn of the year   howev  the extent of the spike can   t be attribut to the calendar nor can the ratchet up of the    day spread   on page   are the under data for the chart on the previous page   pleas don t tri to read the fine print or take out your microscop  just view it from a few inch away and look at the shape of the line  on the left side are the    day yield and on the right side the    day yield  the a  p  rate are the red line and the a  p  rate the black line  you can see the year end for each year  mark by the heavi dash vertic line  compar the bottom panel  which depict the     and    day yield for this year  with those abov from the preced year  while the spike in the    day a  p  yield is quit abrupt  what is even more extraordinari about this year compar to the previous four year is the relat stabil of the a  p  yield  with the    day yield rise onli modest and the    day yield actual declin   this   seem to me to depict someth of a notic flight into a  p  paper  with that paper perhap play someth of a safe haven role as a substitut for treasuri bill   one can note that the a  p  yield for    day paper is right around       percent  which is about what the market is be reward for hold   year a  industri paper   that s not much of a reward for be that much farther out in durat   market particip are expect some liquid to come back to the market in januari and for some of this extraordinari spread to unwind   the question that we won   t know the answer to until then is by how much   turn briefli to domest oper  mr  chairman  on the last page are two panel on reserv need that are similar to the one i includ last  e   the top panel depict actual and project cumul chang in reserv need as we forecast them   the solid orang line is our current forecast for autonom factor   the dash red line show our project at the  e of your last meet  we ve had veri modest chang in our forecast   in the bottom panel is the path of open market oper we   re contempl for year end   as you can see  we   re on cours for have about     billion in long term  one month rps outstand  and we expect to top off the year end with just a littl more than    billion in overnight repo   this contrast with the more than      billion in repo we had outstand on decemb   st of last year   mr  chairman  we had no foreign exchang oper to report   i will need the committe   s ratif of our domest oper   i   d be happi to answer ani question
refresh my memori  what   s the differ between a and p
one is the s p terminolog and the other is moodi   s
which is which
a is s p  am i right
a is s p  p is moodi   s
let me ask about the sharp drop in the    year swap differenti associ with the decemb  th speech   this is an arbitrag oper   what is it that make rate move or can induc that sort of respons on an arbitrag oper
well  the whole yield curv began to move   i think the mortgag portfolio manag look at your speech and saw in it a mix of a soft land forecast and an eas forecast without date specif   and they came to feel a need to rush and anticip the hedg need for their portfolio this late in the year   and that  i think  drove them to grab whatev asset were avail  whether they were agenc debt secur  u s  treasuri  or swap  to move into to hedg their durat risk   there was an arbitrag opportun to wash some of this back out as our    year swap rate came down in a veri pronounc manner  more than in europ   but in the year end environ
if they had those expect  wouldn   t you expect to see it more pronounc in the   year swap   it depend on whether it   s sole a mortgag hedg oper  and it s obvious not   but the way you describ it there was a sort of broader soft land  monetari eas notion   if that were the fundament concept from which they were deal  wouldn   t one have expect the   year swap rate to go down more
the explan offer to me relat to the avail of futur market substitut   that is  the overal hedg market at the short end of the yield curv is so much deeper than at the current longer end of the yield curv  the    year  that the result is this exagger swing   and were this not happen at a year end  the expect is that it would have sort itself out more quick
final  on the commerci paper spread issu  i assum on the suppli side that there   s realli no shift from a s to a s that would alter the suppli posit here  that s a veri rare event as i recal   so it   s truli the result of all of the telecom paper that they held  they thought it was a good invest but becam disench   i would assum if that is true  that the    day spread  in fact both spread  would look like the nasdaq     it
i don   t know
in other word  if you becam disench with telecom a  p  paper  the presumpt  i would assum  is that you becam disench with the compani  the amount of paper issu in the  efram it took for  say  the    day rate to surg couldn   t be veri much   so it had to be what they were previous hold   i have no way of know  but one would assum the telecom segment of the nasdaq would look like this  in revers obvious   you don   t know that
i guess i would share that sen ent   i   m tri to rack my mind on this  i have a sens here that the commerci paper market lag slight what happen to the firm    equiti valu in this case  and it s play catch up
what happen to effici market theori    laughter
differ peopl handl the portfolio who don   t talk to each other
thank you  sir  that s veri help   further question for     yes  governor
on your page    there is a veri visibl spike in the lower left panel  was there some particular event that caus that
this is the roll into decemb  the point at which the    day paper carri over into the new year
on the same page     my puzzl was just a littl differ from the chairman   s puzzl on the bottom part becaus i was look at the red line go up last year and    this year  and i was think that the a  p  didn   t go up as much this year   but what   s go on with the a  p  that the yield is just flat across there   there s no year end movement in it  wherea in all the rest of the year shown on the page there was some movement even in the a  p  rate   and this year it was zip
to elabor on what i   d hope to convey in my remark  i think it   s a flight to qualiti issu of the substitut for treasuri bill be much more pronounc   in the prior year  there   s a sens that the total sum of balanc sheet credit to be offer is be constrain as the intermediari want to slim down for year end  affect both the a  and the a  market  though not quit equal   but you can see the impact in the prior year   what is quit differ this year is that there  sn   t seem to be ani constraint on the a  p  market   so it  sn   t look like a quantiti constraint   it look like a flight to qualiti   they   re substitut for treasuri bill and mayb the a  market is be pull down a littl by the ralli in treasuri bill
ani further question for     vice chair  do you want to use your usual
move approv of domest oper
i usual don   t get the request for a motion out in  e  you move approv befor i get the word out
well  i   ll tell you what i was think about   in further answer to jerri jordan   s question  if you look back at          the a  p  line was veri flat then    in         we had the asian crisi  in         we had the russian crisi  and in           we had y k   so one can argu that this year is the closest thing we   ve had to a normal year sinc this  e in        i don   t know if that   s valid  but that   s what i was think of when i forgot to move approv of the domest oper
if you say it fast enough  it has a certain tenor   shall we move on to the econom report   dave   and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought that perhap i could make a use contribut to the meet this morn by dispens with my usual brief and move straight to the question and answer period   and  as a holiday offer to you  i propos to pose the question  as well as answer them   in my view  there would appear to be three princip question surround the chang that we have made to the  book forecast  first  has the staff overreact to the accumul sign of a slow economi  mani anecdot  by mark down substanti our near term forecast   in that regard  we revis down our outlook signific in      and      when sign of slow emerg  onli to discov a few month later that the expans had lost littl or no momentum   second  and convers  is the staff ignor some power signal that the economi is move through a cyclic turn point and that a cumul contract in activ may alreadi be under way   after all  as i note in the juli chart show  the staff  and for that matter virtual all econom forecast  fail to reliabl predict recess   and final  is it possibl that the staff   s project of slow growth and an attend eas of resourc pressur  without recess  could be correct   let me begin by answer the final question  both becaus it is the simplest to answer and becaus it provid my implicit respons to the first two question   i think i can safe say  with probabl approach one  that the staff forecast will not be correct   exact how we will be wrong  of cours  is not clear   but i do think a reason case can be made that what we are current experienc is a sharp slow of aggreg product  rather than either a temporari dip in growth or an outright broad base declin in activ   there can be littl doubt that the sign of a signific and widespread slow in real output have continu to multipli sinc the last meet   as a consequ  we have knock about   to       percentag point off of our project of real gdp growth this quarter and next  and we have made somewhat smaller downward adjust to our forecast beyond the near term   the most dramat develop have occur in the motor vehicl sector  which account for rough half of the near term downward revis that we have made to the forecast   sale of light vehicl have declin in recent month  and we are expect a further notic drop off in the pace of sale into the first quarter   face with    clear evid of a more persist slowdown in sale  it now look as if the automak are pois to move more aggress to rein in burgeon inventori   rather than prop up sale through a further sweeten of incent  the manufactur are cut product schedul   moreov  we are expect that these alreadi reduc plan will be mark down further and that some current schedul holiday shutdown will be extend into januari   even with the prompt and sizabl product cut we have envis  the inventori situat is not like to be clear up until the spring   neither sale nor product of light vehicl as yet have exhibit a fall of cyclic dimens   the same cannot be said of heavi truck  a sector where the term    recess    can be appli fair   by the first quarter of next year  we expect product of medium and heavi truck to be onli about one half the level of a year ago   moreov  with order backlog sever depress  we are not expect a percept recoveri ani  e soon   the weak we are see in factori activ  howev  extend beyond the motor vehicl manufactur   to be sure  some of the appar soft reflect the indirect effect on upstream supplier to the motor vehicl industri  for exampl  fabric metal  textil  and semiconductor   but evid of inventori overhang and of accompani product adjust has becom appar over the past coupl of month in a broad rang of industri   the product of applianc  machineri  steel  paper  and lumber has declin over the past month or so   heighten competit from import also has weigh heavili on some of these industri  especi steel and lumber   ad to these difficulti  there has been a mark slow in the product of comput and microprocessor   all told  we are now project manufactur output to declin in the first quarter befor turn up in the spring   we are anticip that  go forward  manufactur will move reason prompt to work off undesir inventori and to adjust to a slower pace of final sale growth   in that regard  we think that the growth of privat demand has slow over the cours of this year and that the slowdown will intensifi in come month   in addit to the falloff in sale of motor vehicl  other consum spend has slow  though by just a bit more than we had been anticip   but given the recent deterior of consum sen ent and our project of a further slow in job gain  we have lower our forecast for the growth of real pce notic in the near term to about   percent   that   s still not shabbi  but it   s a far cri from the   percent plus pace of the past few year      the downward adjust that we have made to our forecast for equip and softwar spend over the next few quarter  i   d have to admit  is a bit more specul   inde  the data on order and shipment of capit good actual came in a bit stronger than we had project in the novemb  book  so our revis here are more forecast than fact   that said  the tighten of financi condit this fall and the appar slowdown in the growth of output and final sale seem veri like to take a toll on capit spend in come month   in addit  we have mark down further our project for high tech equip spend   there has been a gradual evolut in the stori that have been told about this sector over the past four or five month   the initi sign of weak were attribut to firm specif problem of market share   then  the difficulti were ascrib to the weak of the euro and the associ soft in profit earn abroad   now  with most firm and near everi market segment experienc sale and earn disappoint  there is more troubl talk of a global slowdown in demand   accord  we have reduc our forecast of busi spend on comput  softwar  and communic equip  with the largest revis occur over the first three quarter of next year   our project of spend on high tech equip has more of a cycl now  with the come year be one of compar weak follow by some recoveri in        we continu to believ that a rapid pace of technic progress will creat profit opportun for invest in this equip over the longer haul   moreov  to the extent that there has been over invest in these good  the situat should prove relat short live   in contrast to the situat with respect to offic build in the late     s  the pace of technic progress is rapid enough in the tech sector that a firm can probabl carri a quarter of it it equip out to the dump  everi year  an action that is a bit more difficult to take with an offic build   taken togeth  we see a confluenc of factor combin to produc a period of veri subdu growth and rise unemploy over the next sever quarter   but we are not yet forecast recess   there certain have been sever develop in recent week that could be read as signal the onset of a cyclic downturn   these includ  most notabl  the steep rise in initi claim for unemploy insur  the plung in consum sen ent in decemb  the declin in industri product in octob and novemb  and the widen scope of downward revis in expect of corpor earn   this is a configur that could be consist with a cyclic turn point      the problem is that these same develop are also consist with a sharp slow in activ  not just outright declin   we would expect further increas in initi claim  if payrol employ growth slow to the        to        month pace that we are expect this winter   consum sen ent also should be expect to deterior further if our macro outlook come to pass   industri product has declin outsid of recess period in the past   and  a flatten out of corpor earn should be expect to accompani a cyclic slow of product and an updrift in labor compens in an economi where there are some restraint on price power   we are acut awar that this interpret of recent event could be analog to that of the proverbi man who jump off the roof of the build and report as he pass the third floor window     so far  so good       and we cannot rule out that the economi  like the man  will experi a hard and pain land   but  we think the odd favor a continu of posit growth  and we still do not yet see enough evid to persuad us that we have enter  or are about to enter  recess   if the economi manag a downshift in growth while escap an abrupt contract in activ  there are forc that should be work to support aggreg demand next year and into        oil price alreadi have retrac some of the spike observ this fall  and futur market and our forecast anticip further declin in the quarter ahead  give a boost to domest incom   the dollar has come off it recent peak  and a further project declin should support fa  growth of export later next year   while consider uncertainti surround the fiscal outlook  it is difficult to imagin ani greater restraint go forward and not far fetch to imagin much greater eas   and  final  despit some minor downward adjust of late  we remain op ist about under product develop  and we expect longer term incom trend to be favor   becaus we are project a more substanti slowdown in activ next year than in the last  book  labor market pressur abat more quick in this forecast   inde  those pressur are now about fulli offset by the indirect effect of declin oil price on busi cost and on nomin compens   as a consequ  we are essenti project no further acceler in price inflat  with core pce and core cpi inflat level off at a   and       percent pace  respect  over the forecast period      all in all  i guess i   m not bring you tide of great joy   on the other hand  it s not yet a big sack of coal   with that  i   ll turn the floor over to
let me first updat you on the implic for our outlook of the data we have receiv sinc the  book forecast was final   last week the balanc of payment data for the third quarter were releas  and this morn trade data for octob becam avail   the nomin trade balanc narrow slight in octob to       billion  with export and import both decreas from their septemb figur   on balanc  these data releas sinc last wednesday impli small chang to our outlook for the extern sector that net to essenti no chang from the net export project we present in the  book   in put togeth this forecast  we revis down our project for growth in our trade partner  with the downward adjust averag about     percentag point at an annual rate in the near term but diminish over the forecast period   the extent of revis vari across countri and region   still  real output growth abroad should remain moder strong and rebound a bit from the       percent pace that we project for the near term to around       percent by the second half of      and dure        three differ set of factor have becom more visibl over the intermeet period  lead us  as well as other  to becom less op ist about the global economi   first are the direct effect of slower growth of the u s  economi on the rest of the world   these effect are strongest on our closest trade partner such as canada and mexico but are signific elsewher as well   in this set of factor i includ the project impact on export and import that the improv competit of u s  product in all market that result from the chang in the valu of the dollar is project to have   a second set of factor relat to the indirect effect of recent develop in the u s  economi that are transmit through global financi market   these includ widespread equiti price declin  higher spread for emerg market debt  and general reduc willing to bear risk   to some degre  these shift are happen in global market as investor react to chang percept about the u s  economi and earn prospect and rebal their portfolio in order to reduc overal risk or respond to major valuat chang   less op ist expect for the high tech sector in the unit state and the pace of    new economi    invest translat into reduc profit project for industri in that sector global  and the equiti price of those firm have been depress in most market   these financi    market channel in turn have an impact on busi and consum confid and wealth abroad that lessen the outlook for domest demand in those countri   final  a third set of factor relat to develop in the global economi not associ with recent u s  develop that impli a less robust pace for foreign output growth   in principl  there are similar factor that would boost foreign growth  but the last five week do not seem to have yield mani of these   in this categori belong financi pressur in argentina and in turkey  which have becom urgent  although right now it appear that with the support of the imf these countri will avoid financi collaps and a forc chang in exchang rate regim  their prospect are darker than in novemb   in the case of argentina  the effect of this crisi on other emerg market countri in the region have led us to reduc our forecast for output growth in latin america a bit more than we would otherwis have done   polit stress in some asian economi  includ the philippin and indonesia  are an addit negat factor   in japan  consumpt remain weak and the recoveri has not succeed in becom establish   these develop are larg in line with our prior expect  which have been more pessimist than consensus forecast   howev  the prolong failur of the japanes economi to rebound make adjust in the asian emerg economi all the more difficult   we have no precis way to separ and measur these three set of influenc on foreign activ   the indic that we reli upon to guid our near term forecast  such as order data  confid survey  and the element of product  reflect all of these channel at work   the staff   s global econometr model tell us that a shock to u s  invest demand spill over to reduc averag foreign gdp growth after four quarter by about one third of the total impact on u s  gdp growth when u s  monetari polici respond accord to a taylor rule   the effect are strongest on canadian and mexican gdp growth  as would be expect   this correspond to what i have term abov the direct effect of weaker u s  growth   in revis down our outlook for foreign growth by more than this one third rule of thumb would suggest  we have given some weight to indirect effect not captur in the model   in particular  we think sever develop asian economi reli heavili on the electron industri and will be hit hard  includ through indirect financi channel   in addit  a combin of wealth effect and blow to consum and busi confid are expect to reduc the growth of domest demand somewhat in sever other industri countri    we have no illus that we have gotten this just right   clear  we can imagin       wors case    outcom in which a global cycl of reduc demand  diminish prospect for profit  asset price declin  and some further reduct in demand spiral sharpli down   but we think there are macroeconom safeguard out there  particular in europ and canada  that will moder the deceler in econom activ abroad and spur an acceler later in      and        import among them are plan fiscal s ulus and reason favor credit expans condit   while i cannot point to signific posit develop that would have work to offset those point to downward revis  there are some steadi influenc that at least kept our pessim in check  real output growth in china remain solid and should help to support activ in asia   global oil price still seem pois to declin signific go into next year   and growth in europ  while moder  should remain sound   we would be happi to answer ani question
mr  chairman  i don   t realli have a question but i have an issu i want to rais if no one is go to ask a question   i   m not sure this is the right  e to do it  but i don   t know when els on the agenda to do it   the issu relat to the new legisl that reinstitut our semi annual monetari polici report   i believ that legisl requir you to testifi  among other thing  on the object and plan of the board and the committe with respect to the conduct of monetari polici  as well as on econom develop and prospect for the futur   i think it   s interest becaus befor  under the humphrey hawkin legisl  our statement in the report on our object and plan had to be tie to the growth of the monetari aggreg   under this new legisl  as i understand it  the ball is realli in our court in term of how we present that report  the legisl hasn   t instruct us to do it in a particular way or tie our hand in ani respect   it seem to me that this might give us an opportun to consid some approach like inflat target that we have been reluct to consid befor becaus we might be seen as preempt the congress   i was just wonder  are we perhap go to be abl to look at some option on this
presid broaddus  i think not   in my view that legisl was mere a compromis to get the report requir through and reinstat it   if the issu of how the statist are present or evalu is disput  it is on a veri minor level   the notion of whether we go to a specif differ type of polici structur has greater content in it  and if we did that i believ we would find that all of a sudden blatant concern would emerg in the congress  so i would not misread what the passag of that legisl was   it was one of those last minut  patch togeth type of compromis  and if anybodi thought someth was be substant chang in the process  they would have object   the presumpt on the part of everybodi is that although it involv a languag chang  everyth remain the same   if we indic that we were shift our approach to this  i guess it   s no longer call humphrey hawkin  one side or the other would have develop a fair strident posit against us   it is conceiv that at some later date that we might be abl to do what you suggest  but to do it befor enabl legisl would be ill advis   we should in no way misread the chang in the legisl as substant
if i may say so  i would hope that we would look for opportun to consid altern approach   it worri me that we no longer have anyth like the rang for the aggreg  which for all of their weak in recent year were a fair object anchor  at least at the begin  for our longer run polici action
i think it certain has been the general view of the committe  as evidenc by the natur of our discuss  that long term price stabil is our object   it   s unambigu  unequivoc  and i would say held pretti much by everyon around this tabl   the onli oper question is whether it is statutori or not   and were we to tri to make it statutori  i suspect we   d run into some veri signific resist
in support of your percept  mr  chairman  there actual was an attempt by some senat to embodi an explicit price stabil goal in the legisl   and other who were involv at the committe level object to that and did not want to go to that point
just one point to follow up on that  one possibl way to oper is to note that while we   re no longer requir to report target for the monetari aggreg it  sn   t mean that we shouldn   t be monitor and look at them   they still play the role of anchor a sens of inflat target
mr  chairman  two point  one  i associ myself with your comment      percent  which is     e more than the usual enthusiasm with which i support your view
last  e i recal      percent be use that way was in a presidenti campaign  laughter  and it didn   t work out veri well
this will work out better   my second point is on the staff present   i think the reason there seem to be no question or comment is that the present were remark good and extrem well balanc   i d like to note that i thought     s present of the balanc of risk intern was right on the mark   i wouldn   t disagre with a singl thing she said
i agre that the present gave a veri nice sens of the uncertainti that we face   i have a question about the inventori situat  given that inventori are so often a major part of cyclic process   my impress from look at the data and the chart is that inventori are not far out of line   we have noth like the kind of inventori situat that we   ve    seen at cyclic peak  where inventori clear have blown up  lead to a substanti cut in product    yet there are area where there are inventori concern   could you elabor a bit on the inventori situat   what is the right sens of that
i think your descript is pretti close to the one that i would give as well   there has been some back up in inventori level   if we went back four or five month  we would have been hard press  outsid of mayb some hint in automobil  to see much in the way of inventori problem develop   but in recent month we have seen some heavi of inventori in a varieti of area   obvious  the automot sector is one where they have built up quit a bit   steel is anoth   i gave a list of area where we   re see a buildup   but it  sn   t yet look like a recess type scenario in term of the magnitud of the rise in inventori sale ratio  and in our forecast we are assum a quit prompt adjust in product  we think we   re alreadi see it  that is go to prevent such a situat from develop and then lead to the kind of normal cyclic turn that one might expect   obvious  that   s predic on our under view about final sale not fall out of bed either   if there realli were a signific contract of sale over the next month  what  sn   t now appear to be a terribl troubl inventori problem could becom one relat quick   so we see us get through this with a product adjust and a period of some declin in industri product  but not one that spill over to a busi cycl adjust   nevertheless  we   re nervous about that situat
may i just rais a caveat with respect to that   histor dure recess we basic were look at an essenti trendless inventori sale ratio   and the type of cyclic pattern presid pool was refer to involv bulg that look obvious far greater than the one that we now have   but in the last decad we   ve had declin inventori sale ratio   the point realli is that inventori excess is essenti in the eye of the behold  or more    import  in the eye of the behold who has his hand on the product lever   and i think we have to use a differ measur to make a judgment as to whether in fact the true under trend is still head down   in this case  if you tilt the trend  the bulg look big   the onli statist we have to help make that judgment is the answer to a question in the nation associ of purchas manag month survey of manufactur   how do you evalu the inventori of your custom    and sinc by definit all inventori are produc either by a manufactur or mine or some other good oper  presum we have all of the custom repres implicit in that sampl   that number has start to move up and is now at a somewhat elev level relat to the past   but the seri is not long enough  as i understand it  to give us a reliabl analyt basi   we actual recommend that the question be put in the survey   was it a coupl of year ago now
sever year ago
okay  sever year ago   but that number has move up  which   tend to squar with what dave   is say   it s not an abnorm concern  but clear it is edg up   were final sale to slow  my suspicion is that that particular number would go up quit notic   but read inventori is not as easi as it use to be   in the past  peopl didn   t know precis what their inventori were  and as a consequ they rose veri rapid at  e and were unambigu out of line and recess happen  usual befor peopl had the inventori number that told them inventori were too high   so this is a differ type of situat  but one that still can be a potenti problem
one more comment on inventori   as one who in an earlier incarn had respons for manag inventori  the technolog that   s avail to manag today is light year better than we use to have some  e ago  not onli inform technolog but mani    other thing as well   as a consequ  there s a micro control capabl  absent an absolut declin in final demand of cours   that abil to micro control is go to lead  i think  to more littl saw tooth type variat in inventori rather than the larg wave that we saw earlier   and i would submit that the likelihood is that the inventori recess that we rememb histor are a thing of the past
one would almost assum that  on the ground that in fulli autom retail establish the bar code check out what is be sold and item are automat reorder   so the long lag in bookkeep  where inventori could build up befor one knew it  no longer exist    adjust occur veri quick   if sale go down  boom   sudden there   s a big shift in the purchas pattern  the question  howev  is how preval is this total autom system   i think the answer to that is onli part
but perhap increas
yes  no question about it   in fact the  onli part  issu is the answer to how far out on the s curv we are in a technolog sens   presid parri
dave  in the forecast  your es  of potenti growth for the next two year is in the low   percent area or someth like that   we have forecast gdp growth of       percent  rough  and have discuss the risk that it could be even slower than that  perhap by a percent or two   should our respons and thought about polici be differ now  given that potenti is quit a bit higher than in the past   in other word  should the prospect of   to   percent gdp growth generat the same level of concern that we would have had mayb five year ago with a   to    percent forecast
i think that s a veri interest question   it s one that we   ve been kick around  but i m not sure we have a complet answer to it   it s obvious in some sens that    with higher under potenti output growth  a   percent shortfal would still give us growth of around   to       percent wherea when potenti output was       percent growth could be near    howev  as to whether or not you should be think about it entir differ  the one caution i would provid is that i think there are still like to be cyclic event   those could be sharp  nonlinear type event that would drive a growth rate from   percent to   percent simpli becaus there is a rather abrupt chang in expect  a signific shift that would produc a situat that would look like a recess   it wouldn t just be a slow in growth from   percent to   or   percent  it would have the look and feel of a recess even if the number were a littl higher than in the recess we have experienc in the past  with veri rapid increas unemploy and cutback in consum spend that would be relat to shift in consum sen ent   so in that regard i think the way you approach some of the risk to the economi still ought to involv think that there is the potenti for high nonlinear event to occur   and your respons in that sens ought to be the same as you thought about it in the past
but the consequ of the growth rate declin to  say    to   percent could be even more signific   one could get greater employ effect et cetera   and the impact on inflat eventu could be even stronger
yes  i agre   that is absolut correct
further question for our colleagu   if not  would somebodi like to start the committe discuss   go ahead  presid

thank you  mr  chairman   current data suggest that the new england economi continu to grow at a solid pace  with veri low unemploy and higher inflat than the rest of the nation   but recent beigebook and other contact suggest an increas sens of caution about the futur   in addit  a survey we conduct relat to the use of stock option as a form of compens rais concern about increas wage pressur  new england s rate of unemploy declin again in octob to       percent  a new seri low   connecticut  at   percent  record the lowest state jobless rate in the nation but massachusett wasn t far behind   and even the two new england state with the highest rate of unemploy  rhode island and main  are below the nation rate by     percentag point or better  we ve been watch a new web base electron job monitor servic call    flip dog    that began last spring   accord to that index  massachusett rank number one in electron job vacanc relat to the size of it labor forc and in absolut size is second onli to california  in addit  accord to this servic   s job opportun index  which rank high competit labor market with insuffici pool of qualifi labor and the need for new worker from out of state  all new england state rank in the top     with vermont and massachusett number one and two  obvious  this is a new sourc of data and it s hard to know it accuraci   howev  it is complet in tune with the region s report unemploy rate and the anecdot we continu to hear about labor be extrem hard to find and increas expens   in fact  recent commerc depart data on person incom for all worker  not just product worker  includ hour     tip  and bonus  as well as wage  indic that per employe incom rose by       percent in the region from q       to q         that is   percentag point higher than in the nation as a whole  look forward  beigebook and other contact were more cautious than they have been  particular in the manufactur and retail area   softwar and temporari agenc firm still see veri tight labor market and view the demis of some dot com as an opportun to get skill worker that have been in veri short suppli   manufactur have been do fair well  especi in export market  but sound concern about futur prospect   in particular  retail such as wal mart have cut back order  and compani in the high tech arena mention concern about soften demand on both the consum and the busi side   one                                          ceo of a veri larg bank  recent held a two day plan session aim specif at reduc cost by    percent or better  given the expect that revenu growth would be slower than expect in        an invest manag of a local larg insur compani report bond loss in      that were more sizabl than expect and a real sens of caution look forward   thus  even in the face of continu region job strength  export growth  and rise wage and hous price  it is also increas clear that the futur is more in doubt and that expect are gloomier now than they have been  this sens of increas uncertainti has character the incom nation data sinc our last meet   we  like the  book  have revis our forecast for consumpt over the near term  given relat weak person incom and real consumpt  a weaker stock market  and a serious drop in motor vehicl spend  we ve revis that forecast to the mid  s along with the  book  with gdp growth at about   percent or a bit below   this slower pace of growth continu through the first half of      as it   in the  book  with some pickup in the second    half   we re a bit agnost about the  book s assess of potenti  so we see less of an uptick in unemploy and a bit more price pressur  but overal not enough to quibbl about  the interest question that dave   and bob parri talk about  regard what is the definit of  weak  in a high potenti economi with grow structur product  is someth we ve debat a bit  too   and i think some of the number in the  book baselin project stand out simpli becaus of the way the two factor  the higher product and the slower growth  play out   in particular  i realli focus on the degre to which unemploy rise in a veri short period of  e  i ve never seen that befor outsid of a recess   so this sens that we are in differ water and differ  e  and that it   s harder to use the past as a prologu to the futur  certain has affect our think as well  that take me to the issu of the risk to this forecast   the economi need to slow and seem it has   interest  howev  reflect that earlier convers  most level of activ  whether we look at car sale  residenti invest  employ  sen ent  or chang in busi invest  would at most other  e seem pretti solid   but now  after the truli stun growth of      into       former respect level of activ seem meager   the general tenor of thing has sour   that is clear   wit the stock market  the credit market  and the general feel of doom and gloom   downsid risk certain have emerg  as the  book make clear   but the biggest risk  i think  is overreact   labor market remain strong and consum and busi spend could as easili be in a lull as a downturn   and inflationari pressur  while quiescent  have not disappear   hold steadi seem to me  anyway  a wiser cours than move now as we wait to see what the new year bring   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   speak from the old economi region of the countri in contrast to the new economi region  the view realli is quit differ   at a joint board of director meet of our three board last thursday  one of the director cite an index that i had never look at befor   she said that in the three week sinc thanksgiv to that date  the salvat armi s collect were down    percent from a year earlier   now  i don t know what to make of that becaus i alway thought that a littl prayer went along with the coin in the kettl   so i don t know if it mean there s less to pray about or less money to spend
it s too cold to go out
exact   first  on construct  public sector construct spend in the region remain strong  but residenti  commerci  and industri are all down  and most expect are that activ in      will be below that experienc in        inventori of construct materi are said to be high  and the earlier report shortag and long lead  e  especi for item such as b  and drywal  have disappear   price of construct materi are report to be below level prevail at the begin of the year  turn to motor vehicl  truck product is off sharpli and part supplier have begun layoff and plant shutdown   in the region peopl would say the truck industri is in a depress not a recess   one larg truck dealer that sell in seven state of the region said that almost    percent of his sale have gone delinqu in the last    day   sever auto assembl and part plant have close for the final week of the year  steel execut expect the auto compani to cut product schedul further  which reinforc what you were suggest  dave   in the steel industri  the situat was describ as dire  one compani reenter bankruptci  it s the second  e for them  and other are expect to declar bankruptci soon   three ceo in the district were fire in the past month    ken has    close all of it steel plant and three bear plant for the balanc of the year                         with a long career in steel said the bloodlet has onli just begun  retail  not onli those in the region but chain that oper nation  report sharpli lower year over year sale   even with the addit sell day and the extra saturday between thanksgiv and christma  sale through the middl of last week were so far below year earlier level  that the differ cannot be made up in the remain sell day   sale at one compani  bath and bodi  are down    percent  and this is the first year over year declin in the compani s histori  on the subject of inventori i ve heard one report that i don t know what to make of  nor do i know enough about the issu to be well inform   nevertheless  we were told that wal mart has notifi it supplier that start next year they won t get paid until the good are sold   and if the good are not sold wal mart will return them  which mean they are the properti of the supplier  i don t know how wal mart will set price in that kind of environ   so  that type of practic is go to muddl the inventori data further  among other thing  a food process and distribut compani report that while sale have been soft  the price of food process equip have drop and labor turnov has declin  so profit margin are good even in the face of the larger discount they are now offer  labor market are report to have eas consider with the major except of the health care sector  where the shortag of hospit worker and pharmacist is still describ as sever   among our contact two area were cite as show some strength  safeti equip is describ as strong  with an order backlog  both domest and foreign  and order for spring deliveri of sport apparel from one manufactur are said to be high   banker report a notic slow in loan demand  especi for mortgag and auto financ   but on the other side  larg and    small bank report a signific draw down of home equiti loan  which may not be a sign of strength   member of our commerci bank advisori council all report increas in what they describ as  voluntari repossess   especi of suv type vehicl  truck  and boat   most expect loan growth to be much slower in      and have budget for higher charg off   the head of one larg bank compani headquart in our district said that a year ago they were get hammer by institut investor becaus they were onli promis    to    percent earn growth  and this year they are get reward for promis   percent   so  expect may be adjust   softwar compani are said to be cut price  especi for develop of internet site   otherwis  i guess they move to boston   some dot com compani have ceas oper becaus ventur capit fund have dri up and these firm never reach the bankabl stage  let me turn to the nation economi and econom polici   at recent meet of director and advisori council i suggest that perhap what we had been observ in recent week was what i call the    gulf war syndrom    my idea was that uncertainti  in this case uncertainti associ with the elect outcom  was caus onli a temporari postpon of commit by household and busi alik  as we saw in the week befor desert storm   i found almost no support for the idea   it certain cannot explain what we see in the truck and steel industri   it is like that we will see a success of downward revis in privat sector forecast for major industri  as well as for the nation economi in       i want to make a few observ about what i consid to be appropri and inappropri use of contemporan or high frequenc data for polici purpos   i do not believ that report of econom weak should call for monetari or fiscal pump prime s ulus to head off a cumul process of contract   i don t think that s the way our economi work   i do believ that a market economi has an inher tendenc to expand  as advers effect of various    shock such as sharp increas in energi price tend to wear off   howev  we do have to be alert to the mirror imag of the sharp acceler of product growth that we ve observ  with a lag  in recent year   by that i mean that our observ were with a lag   we came to recogn that if we held the overnight interbank rate unchang as the natur or equilibrium market rate of interest rose in the face of strong wealth creation  we could inadvert accommod an inflationari process   an unchang feder fund rate with rise market rate is a de facto eas of the stanc of polici  and that s true whether it come from an increas inflat premium or what we call the real rate  convers  if forc are at work that are put downward pressur on the natur rate  an unchang overnight bank rate is a de facto tighten of the stanc of polici   in this context  the natur or the equilibrium structur of market rate is not the same thing as what we usual mean when we talk about real rate  which can never be observ ex ant   this year  for exampl  it might be tempt to cite the lower treasuri yield in the face of fa  inflat as evid of lower real interest rate and consequ an easier stanc of polici   i believ that conclus would be wrong  in a nutshel  lower the fed fund rate in the present environ would not and should not be view as an act of step on the monetari acceler   it would be and should be view as an act of reduc the pressur current be appli to the brake pedal   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the evid is now clearer that the pace of growth has slow in our southeast region  although some sector continu to perform quit well  singl and multi famili hous permit  unit under construct  and home sale are flat to down slight from year ago level  although still at respect level   builder tell us that traffic is down  inventori of unsold hous are up somewhat  and price concess are now more common   and    that soft is spill over to mani of our region   s relat industri like lumber and applianc  auto are show the same pattern and that  too  is affect the mani local supplier that feed that industri   commerci real estat market have remain relat strong across much of our district   neither offic nor industri market have shown much evid of excess specul and vacanc rate are littl chang   report indic that fewer project are in the pipelin  and caution has put some plan on hold  includ an in town residenti project that is plan for part of the leftov properti we recent sold that was adjac to our new fed build  in manufactur  overal activ continu to moder  with cutback in hour as well as some temporari and perman plant close   lumber and steel product declin are clear due to lower demand and to foreign competit  while cutback in the paper industri we ve seen recent are the consequ of consolid and restructur   howev  all is not bad  shipbuild continu to expand and the louisiana oil and gas industri is back to pre      level  which is benefit rig fabric and pipelin maker   and despit the current inventori problem  there are labor product adjust   the auto industri continu to make long term invest in new and more modern plant and equip in our region  retail sale were report to be moder strong over the thanksgiv weekend  but colder weather may have provid a bit of a boost   inventori are report to be reason in balanc   retail tell us that their expect for the holiday period are more modest than a year ago   tourism is a bit more mix this  e  with recent report of continu strength in some area and new weak in other   the cruis ship busi is feel the effect of substanti new capac brought on line in recent year and florida is suffer a bit of a hangov from the pullout of the bush and gore lawyer    laughter    somewhat slower growth appear to be moder pressur on labor market just a bit  but scarciti in nurs and other technic skill remain     final  price pressur remain in check for the most part  despit the headlin news about winter natur gas bill that are up to tripl year ago level  our banker are tell us that loan growth has slow consider across all busi line   some borrow are report complain about the shrink syndic loan market and have to pay higher price to generat interest in their debt issu   there has been consider public discuss about deterior credit qualiti  especi at larg bank   while nonperform asset have grown at our bank this year  they are still at modest and manag level  turn to the nation economi  i share the  book   s broad view that the slower pace is now more obvious and evid across almost all sector   but i continu to remind myself and other that the degre of slow we are see has to be view with the realiz that the sky high level at which we were oper simpli weren t sustain   of cours  our polici action of a year ago were intend to help creat condit that would discourag excess and bring the economi back to more ration and more sustain level of activ   now that those adjust are take place in auto  in equiti  in credit market  and in other area  we should be neither surpris nor discourag   in fact  mani of the develop we are see  the better control over inventori  the better and quicker ration of money to the construct industri  the more prudent adjust to credit avail general base on borrow risk  are all posit in my view and hope will help damp cyclic swing   market realli do work  our job now is to judg whether the path we are on is measur below potenti and is like to remain so   look forward  if invest spend slow further and inventori invest continu to subtract from growth  if credit avail actual begin to bite  and if compani continu to report undershoot of their earn forecast  then we realli will have someth to worri about from a polici perspect  especi if unemploy pick up    measur and spend declin further   howev  our bank s latest simul are consist with a slow of real gdp growth to onli about recent es  of trend  and our project are not as pessimist as the  book s   at the same  e  i can easili imagin a combin of develop that would leav us at subpar level of growth and quit vulner to ani negat shock that might come along   the most recent inflat data have been general good  although i think the inflat risk we ve point out befor are still there  even if somewhat diminish  my overal sens is that our next move will like be to relax polici some  soon  at least margin   i d be most comfort at the moment  howev  let thing play out a bit more in term of the import adjust that are take place and that we want to see continu   at the same  e  it would seem to me prudent and respons to adjust our press statement come out of this meet to reflect the fact that while inflat risk remain and we have not let down our guard on that front  there are now signific risk that the rate of growth may be below what we consid op    thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  the district has continu to expand  but quit modest  and there are addit pocket of weak and some new area of concern within the region economi   there have been some high public layoff  although the actual level of employ has remain relat high   and privat employ growth continu to follow a modest slow trend for the district  just as it   for the nation  retail sale got off to an okay start this holiday season  but few expect the kind of year over year growth seen last year   also  some concern has been express that holiday sale level have been depend on some heavi discount   by far the weakest compon of consum spend in our region has been for automobil and light truck   both gm and ford have reduc    activ at their kansa citi plant   one has elimin all over  and the other has actual shut down it line for some week dure the holiday  manufactur prefabr metal build and serv on the nation trade associ say he see soften not onli in his busi but in mani other segment of manufactur as well   and busi appear to be take a veri clear wait and see attitud toward invest decis go into next year  construct activ is down from a year ago but remain relat solid overal in the region  particular in the denver area   homebuild report that start turn downward in novemb  follow a modest rebound the month befor   nevertheless  hous start and home sale remain high by histor standard  and the fact that hous price in most citi continu to rise fa  than the general price level suggest that demand for hous is still relat strong  nonresidenti construct start have also stabil recent  after trend down much of the year   energi activ in our district has level off recent but is still the highest in year and is be held back main by a lack of rig and skill worker   so far  district energi firm have benefit from both higher gas price and oil price  inflationari pressur in the region do not seem to have chang signific sinc our last meet   a somewhat higher proport of busi contact report abov normal wage increas in novemb than in previous month   howev  busi did not appear to have ani more success than befor in pass such cost on to the custom   final  the farm economi remain in a slump and depend on govern subsidi  although there has been some reduct in inventori that may help to sustain price in the futur  in term of the nation economi  my outlook has not chang a lot over the past month   i remain cautious about the economi   econom activ clear has slow   so far the slow has    been order and i expect it to continu to be so   the incom price data continu to be consist with a moder under inflat rate as well  let me talk briefli about inflat   obvious  we   ve receiv littl new inform about inflat over the last month  but what we have receiv has been general favor   despit higher energi price and rise import price  core inflat remain modest   and we agre with the board s staff that it should continu that way   i realiz  of cours  that headlin inflat will be far from stabl over the next few month   the spike in natur gas price is just one exampl of the factor that will complic our read of prospect inflat   howev  as the winter pass energi price should retreat to more normal level  a prospect reflect in the futur market   thus  while we may see some volatil in inflat  i expect it to remain modest for the forese futur  turn to the economi more general  growth appear to be moder as expect in the fourth quarter   consum are rein in their spend becaus of slower employ growth and lower stock price this year   manufactur activ has also moder and busi more general are retrench   tighter financi condit  softer earn  and softer balanc sheet appear to be caus firm to scale back their spend plan   one key question is whether the economi is deceler too quick  as   mention   to be sure  recent report on consum confid and retail activ are noteworthi   while the juri is still out  the evid is mount that the slowdown is real and may last a while   the stock market is down signific and anecdot evid suggest that labor market are soften   and as i note earlier  in our district  and i think it is true more general  holiday sale have gotten off to onli an okay start and no one expect strong sale sudden to emerg  in essenc  i agre with the  book that growth will be below trend for some period  also  as i mention at the last meet  i remain somewhat concern that tighter financi    condit pose an addit and import downsid risk   these includ higher interest rate spread  lower equiti price  tighter lend term and standard  increas risk avers toward more specul ventur  and a rise in junk bond default rate   we see higher though still modest c i loan delinqu as well   and final  after tax corpor earn growth is down   as a result  we re see debt as a share of net worth rise in      after level off in prior year   debt servic cost are rise and downward adjust of capit spend plan are take place   none of these factor taken in isol mean growth would deceler beyond expect   but the combin of tighter financi condit and larg financi imbal increas the risk to the outlook  and i think signific  in summari  what the data suggest to me is that the economi can grow at a more modest but healthi pace in the futur and that inflat will remain modest   howev  we might wish to rebal the risk to the economi by consid an adjust in polici that goe beyond just the word in our press statement   thank you
mr  chairman  the sign of slower growth in the nation economi are now more clear reflect in our district economi than they were at the  e of our last meet   consum spend in particular has throttl down and home sale and hous construct have continu to moder   we are hear more report now about layoff at manufactur plant in the  ina  more general we have a sens that labor market are loosen a bit  they are a littl less tight   truck compani in particular have report fewer difficulti find and retain driver   look forward  i think it s fair to say that most of our busi contact are still reason op ist about the prospect for the year ahead  despit the slow in activ  but an increas vocal minor is worri that the nation economi is go    to declin sharpli go forward   and we now hear the    r    word fair frequent in our region for the first  e in sever year  especi in the southern part where there is a lot of old economi manufactur activ   at the same  e  i would point out that our latest month survey of retail and servic firm indic that their price have drift upward in recent week  the data releas sinc our novemb fomc meet have provid further confirm of the soften in the nation economi   the  book has reduc it project of real gdp growth for the current quarter and for the first quarter of next year to about       percent  obvious  that would be a quit pronounc deceler from the   percent rate of growth we saw in the four quarter end in the second quarter of the year   to keep it in perspect  though  that   percent growth rate was not sustain  especi in labor market   that s whi we tighten monetari polici in that period   so  we are get the slow we need  the question  of cours  is whether we re go to get more slow than we need or want   my sens of the  book baselin forecast is that the staff is relat op ist on this score   privat domest final purchas  a key compon of the under longer term growth in aggreg demand  are project to grow between   and       percent for the year ahead  which would be moder below the es        percent potenti gdp growth go forward   that   push the project unemploy rate up to     percent in the fourth quarter   rise unemploy  obvious  is never a good thing  but it seem to me that an increas of that magnitud would probabl be manag  especi if inflat remain contain and growth reacceler in the second half of the year and in       as in the baselin forecast  in short  as i see it  the baselin  book forecast project what i would call a classic soft land with no chang in the fund rate   i have no reason to quarrel with the project and i think the upsid and downsid risk are reason well balanc around it  given the tone of the    regular month econom report sinc our last meet   clear  there are signific downsid risk and i recogn them   a further declin in equiti market or addit tighten in credit market would increas the downsid risk  especi if equiti price were to weaken sharpli  to my mind  anoth point that is import here is exact how household react to rise unemploy if in fact the unemploy rate   begin to rise   if we think back  when we tighten in      the unemploy rate was higher than it is now  but it was on a downward trend  today it look to have bottom out and  of cours  the staff is project an increas and that increas could be even greater than project   we have not had rise unemploy in this countri in about    year   it s hard at this point to gaug how much consum confid would declin if unemploy did begin to rise  even to the moder degre project in the  book  but especi if it were to increas by more than is project  now  i want to be clear  i m awar of the downsid risk out there and i take them serious   i think it s essenti that we do all we can to avoid unnecessarili weaken the current expans   at the same  e  i also believ there s a consider risk in a precipit reaction by this committe to what at this point is still an incipi slowdown  and in particular i think a mark shift to eas could cost us over  e  i have just a coupl of addit comment   in think back on our eas in the fall of       it was clear appropri in retrospect  but it probabl contribut over  e to the moder increas we have seen in various measur of inflat over the last sever quarter   go back even further  our eas in       while again clear necessari in the circumst  in my view help produc the sharp increas in inflat in      and      that set the stage for the recess in        so against that background  i think ani signific eas in polici now risk creat the    percept that we re will to accept a further increas in inflat today to prevent even a moder increas in the unemploy rate from what is histor a quit low level  let me close by say that we need to remind ourselv that we have work veri hard over the last coupl of decad to build what i believ is now the consider credibl of our commit to low inflat   that credibl enhanc our flexibl to respond to downsid risk  unquestion  if circumst warrant  we may need to spend some of that credibl   but in confront the immedi situat  i think we should recogn that there is a risk in eas polici more than expect at a  e when labor market  while perhap a bit looser  are still quit tight and inflat is drift upward   absent a veri sharp deterior in financi market  a real market break as in      and       i think we still have  e to proceed in a measur manner  and i would hope that we   d do that  thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the seventh district has definit slow further over the past month or so  and mani contact indic that addit slow is like   labor market are still tight  but an increas number of layoff and plant shutdown have been report   construct is one of the few area of continu strength  with one of our detroit branch director note that worker are still be recruit from out of state to work on project in michigan   but our winter storm over the past week or so have probabl put mani    construct project on hold  even more than season expect  at least temporarili   sign of moder consum demand are increas appar   while report from retail have been mix  they general indic that holiday sale have been soft sinc the thanksgiv weekend spurt   despit a fair high level of promot activ thus far in decemb  as in past year consum seem to be hold out for even better price on the day just befor and after christma  and report indic that retail will be step up their promot activ further   a former director told us that there has been a sudden larg drop in asian import shipment truck from the west coast in recent week  anoth sign of soften demand  the auto industri had been boost growth in our region earlier this year but is now pull it down   light vehicl sale declin consider in octob and novemb  and the latest es  from the big three suggest further declin in decemb  with sale run at an annual rate in the mid    million unit rang  still histor high but down signific nevertheless   as     mention  product schedul continu to be trim to bring inventori into better align with lower sale level  and most analyst are reduc their forecast for light vehicl sale in       other contact in our manufactur sector also report consider slow   the chicago purchas manag    composit index for decemb  to be public releas on decemb   th  show activ contract again  though not quit as sharpli as in novemb   the index was      in decemb  up from      in novemb   and relat to our discuss earlier  inventori contract signific in decemb  in term of specif industri  our steel and heavi duti truck busi are still in the doldrum  similar to jerri jordan s comment about his district earlier   contact in the print and publish industri report that almost all of their custom are pull back  and in some case are    pull back fast  with advertis in magazin off sharpli  a dramat chang from six month ago  in addit to automak and their supplier  consum durabl manufactur  includ amana  maytag  electrolux  motorola  and other firm  are lay off worker  and temporari help firm report declin demand for industri worker   but with continu tight in our labor market  other employ are often right there to offer laid off worker new job  and temporari posit are still rise for worker outsid of the industri sector  needless to say  the competit environ is fierc and firm have littl price power  energi price  of cours  are the except and particular high heat bill are now arriv in consum    mailbox   busi  too  face higher energi cost along with soften demand for their product and servic  and they are becom more pessimist about the outlook for       what is perhap of concern is that contact have use word like  sharp    dramat   and  tremend  to describ the slowdown they   ve experienc in the past few week  in earli decemb we host our   th annual econom outlook symposium for which over    region economist provid forecast for        the median of these forecast  which were prepar in late novemb  had real gdp rise       percent next year   if those same forecast were poll today  my guess is that the median forecast would be lower   growth is come down from rate that were unsustain  and that slow was need to restor balanc between aggreg demand and potenti suppli   but as my director caution me last week  we need to remain alert so that the slow   not persist to the point of threaten the current expans  the nation economi has clear enter a period of below trend growth   as we all know  in such period it is more difficult than usual to gaug whether the slow will be excess  although our current assess for real gdp growth this quarter and next is a bit stronger than the     book s  we are still predict growth below trend   thus  we expect that the unemploy rate will be rise next year as labor market begin to eas notic  mr  chairman  i agre with your comment earlier this month that this is a  e when the effect of ani negat shock would like be amplifi   with the sharp drop in consum confid recent  the consum seem wari and perhap weari after a long run of strong consumpt growth   tighter credit standard for busi and slower growth in invest spend all signal smaller addit to product capac in the short term   i m still concern about futur inflationari pressur  although they seem less urgent today   if the economi slow as much as we project  it seem plausibl that inflat will level off  in my view the balanc of risk has chang sinc novemb and i m sure that we will want to explain that in our press releas

thank you  mr  chairman   i would describ econom condit in the district as steadi  but sen ent has chang recent and signific so  as best i can judg  clear  peopl are becom more cautious and more concern about the outlook   i think financi market develop have someth to do with that  with the flight to qualiti in the debt market and the declin in equiti valu  as far as evid on activ in the district is concern  it s a mix bag   labor market remain tight and employ   continu to increas   commerci construct is a distinct bright spot  it s veri strong  and home build has held up well   and  as i   ve comment befor  agricultur condit turn out to be better this year than earlier anticip  and farm incom and credit condit were better as a consequ     on the less posit side  i would say that consum spend has to be describ as no better than mediocr   traffic in the mall and other place seem to be high  but spend  sn t seem to be commensur with the traffic   as for the auto industri  of cours  auto dealer are have a tough  e   it s not hard to prompt them to use the word  fear    clear  inventori of new car are high  we are also hear that inventori of use car are quit high as well  higher energi price have advers affect some manufactur  forc them either to curtail activ or in some case to shut down becaus of profit concern   in general  i would say that profit margin are be squeez in a varieti of busi   price pressur in the district seem to be confin most to the servic sector  as far as the nation economi is concern  i think dave   did a good job of summar the current econom situat   specif  it seem to me that a slow in real growth has occur more rapid and with more sever than i had earlier anticip   this may turn out to be temporari  as both the  book and our forecast model suggest  especi if one interpret the slow as simpli a reduct from the   to   percent rang we experienc part of last year and this year to someth more like   or   percent   but i must admit i am not entir comfort with that interpret  part becaus of what i perceiv to be the breadth of the slow and part becaus i rememb pain from my forecast day that one  sn t recogn excess inventori and high inventori sale ratio until after the fact   the imbal becom evid after sale turn out to be more disappoint than expect   howev that may be  it seem to me that go forward inflat is like to level off and perhap even abat a bit over  e  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   incom data suggest that the slowdown in econom growth continu in our region and in the nation   the real question is whether growth is slow too much so that the economi will enter a recess   my own read is that this is still a growth slowdown and that the economi is not head toward a recess  condit in the third district are similar to those that i report at the last meet  growth is down appreci from earlier in the year  with econom activ in the region expect to grow at a slow pace over the next six month   manufactur activ in particular has slow consider sinc last spring and manufactur employ has declin this year   our busi outlook survey of area manufactur  which will be releas this thursday  show declin in the level of econom activ in decemb  and new order remain weak   increas energi cost and increas import competit stem from the strong dollar were cite by steel and metal produc as drag on their busi   and manufactur  near term outlook has weaken appreci in recent month  in contrast  indic in the construct industri are mix  with the residenti hous sector weaken but the nonresidenti sector remain robust   hous permit continu on a downward track in our three state  similar to the pattern in the nation   and home sale are relat weak in pennsylvania and new jersey   on the other hand  the valu of nonresidenti construct in our region rebound in the third quarter and for the year to date has risen about   percent  in contrast to the   percent declin for the nation as a whole   the demand for offic and commerci space remain strong in our region  and rent have move up as a result  the third district retail pictur continu to be similar to that of the nation   retail sale are increas modest and area retail remain somewhat op ist about holiday sale  expect an increas of about   percent in nomin sale compar to last year   motor vehicl sale  by    contrast  remain quit weak   bank lend has improv in recent week  main in the consum area   banker report a slow in demand for busi loan and indic that they have begun to tighten credit standard becaus of concern about slower econom growth and declin corpor profit   nonetheless  banker expect overal loan demand to continu at a slow pace for the remaind of this year and into next  i would character our labor market in the district as still tight   a declin in employ in the third quarter  which i report earlier  appear to have been revers this quarter  the unemploy rate in our region has remain at   percent or less all year   price pressur in our region appear to be lower than in the nation  with the cpi inflat in philadelphia run at a lower pace than the nation averag this year   and employ cost in the northeast are also increas somewhat more slowli than in the nation   accord to our busi outlook survey  there s less upward pressur in industri price than report earlier in the year   and the price paid diffus index is at it lowest level sinc septemb        but this good news is temper by the fact that busi in philadelphia and elsewher in the nation have suffer sharp increas in the cost of health benefit   in philadelphia the cost has gone up       percent this year  the largest rise sinc       and mani employ are report increas in health benefit cost in the    to    percent rang for next year   so inflat concern remain  turn to the nation condit  the data receiv sinc the last fomc meet confirm that the economi is grow at a slower and inde a below trend pace   but a period of below trend growth is need to bring the economi back to potenti growth   compar to a few month ago  the risk of econom weak are now higher   the question is whether growth will slow too quick and turn negat  given the current stanc of polici   in my view  we are about where we want to be   consumpt and invest spend have been the drive forc in this    expans   a drop in equiti price has had an impact on consum spend via the wealth effect  howev  holiday sale are expect to be fair good  though not as strong as last year   sale of motor vehicl have shown a drop in novemb but that  too  is not surpris given their recent extraordinari pace   invest spend has also slow over the first three quarter  but month data on order and shipment of capit good show continu strong growth   employ indic point to an eas in the labor market  although the unemploy rate edg up to   percent in novemb and initi claim have risen  condit remain tight  on the inflat front  there are hint that price pressur are eas and that acceler in core inflat may be end   in my view  we would be wise not to reach this conclus too soon  howev   the core pce and the core cpi tick downward in octob  but core cpi tick back up in novemb  and the cleveland fed   s median price index continu to acceler   inflat expect have remain in check so far  but recent develop have ad to price pressur and inflat remain a concern to me   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   at the last meet i said that the situat was suffici unclear that i was glad there were other to particip in our decis  this  e around condit have chang enough that the pictur is come into clearer focus for me   to get right to the bottom line  i think monetari polici has becom too tight  a simpl argument for arriv at this judgment is base on a standard i ve use befor  the real interest rate from the tip market is about     percent now  and if we build in an anticip inflat rate of about   percent  the equilibrium fund rate should be slight less than   percent   the actual fund rate is more than that  indic that monetari polici is on the tight side  it made perfect sens to tighten monetari polici to this level last may when we were lean against    the inflat rate  but thing have chang now and i no longer believ it make sens to keep the fund rate this high  the second standard is just to examin the  book baselin forecast from a normat standpoint   i   ll rais a few question about that forecast in a second  but for now let s assum it is perfect accur   it show a period of below trend growth  with the unemploy rate eventu rise to   percent   i am not one who believ this outcom is desir or necessari to control inflat   if we can avert some of that rise in unemploy by cut rate  and i believ we can  i think we should  as for risk  on one side i think the inflat risk has becom relat quiescent   the core pce bounc around and we make a lot of the fact that it has risen recent  but it   s still below it level of      and        long term inflat expect have been veri stabl in this whole period and inde have drop to histor low in both the michigan and philadelphia survey  the nomin real spread has drop sharpli recent to about     percent with or without the staff s adjust for the  e of interest payment   it is possibl that special factor could be influenc veri recent movement in this spread  but it still has declin notic this year   trend unit labor cost increas have come back up a bit but are still low   all wholesal price measur are veri stabl and commod price have stabil   there may alway be some chronic risk that inflat will acceler  but these risk seem relat low right now  inde  given these number  i doubt we   d be worri veri much at all about inflat if it weren t for what i ll call nairu guilt pang   es  of the nairu have alway been weak econometr in the sens of have high standard error   moreov  point es  of nairu are bound to be reduc the longer the economi goe without acceler inflat   we are now near the end of the fourth year where the unemploy rate is less than the convent    es  of nairu  with veri littl evid of acceler inflat   sure  there have been special factor  such as the rise in the dollar and the product shock   but as  e goe on  i still becom less and less convinc that unemploy is below the imperfect es  nairu level  on the down side  as i   ve said abov  i see a case for lower rate even in the baselin  book forecast   given the slowdown  that forecast has the economi settl in for a period of below trend growth  eventu take the unemploy rate to   percent   unemploy will probabl rise some from it present level   that seem almost inevit given the circumst  but i do think we should tri to avert some of that rise   i think we ll get veri littl ad inflat credibl by let unemploy increas more than is necessari to control inflat  but that slow growth scenario is not the onli downsid risk   as the  book freeli acknowledg  there is a downsid risk in the  book forecast itself   i talk recent to a note economist who has been studi recess sinc the first postwar recess of         laughter  he report that they seem to develop in three step  an inventori buildup  follow by a crumbl of the pillar of the expans  follow by some unforeseen break in confid   we alreadi have at least a mini inventori buildup   as for the pillar of the expans  the stock market has been level to declin for    month   foreign real growth is taper off and has alreadi been downgrad a few  e in our forecast   the critic japanes economi is a continu sourc of forecast malais   auto sale are weak and futur

thank you  mr  chairman   i think the staff is to be commend for accur repres in it baselin forecast what i believ is a preponder of the quantit evid   the onli problem i have is that the baselin forecast in the  book strike me as a triumph of hope over realiti  i certain believ that the risk are almost all to the down side   the relat sudden revers in the outlook that has emerg recent from more qualit data suggest that the trajectori of the economi may be further downward instead of stabil at an annual growth rate of       to   percent   the rise in initi claim and the drop in consum sen ent both suggest to me the possibl that consum are like to retrench more aggress than is assum in the baselin   similar  earn revis have been come in at a pace i would describ as fast and furious   sinc our last meet  for exampl  we have seen a signific reduct in the expect of analyst for fourth quarter earn for the s p       the year over year growth rate of earn per share is now es  at about     percent   at the last meet that same number was about     percent  which suggest a fourth quarter annual growth rate of minus   percent   that is quit a major chang   similar  if we look at analyst  earn forecast for the year      and adjust them for the usual op  they tend to have  a number close to   percent is    what they are expect for growth in the year       that clear suggest some greater risk of retrench with respect to capit invest and capit deepen  which have been  as you know  a major part of the stori thus far in our economi  similar  we ve seen in other area an ongo tighten of financi condit and what i think someon describ as a  tender  in balanc sheet   when i look at moodi   s result to get a sens of all of this  their expect is that between     and     compani will default on bank loan  bond  or other borrow in the next    month   that is more than tripl the number of default we ve had sinc decemb of        these default  as i said  are driven by debt burden  higher cost of credit  energi  etc  so it seem to me that the risk are primarili to the down side and that the challeng today is to figur out how best to respond to that   we obvious have two choic   one is to use languag  an option that i think is certain heavili on the tabl   the other is to actual make a move with respect to polici  so whi am i not support a move in polici as my friend and colleagu governor   is suggest   for a coupl of reason   one is that i believ some of the first round effect of our tighten move are probabl alreadi behind us   oil price are like to fall and the futur market suggest that   second  there is a slight weaker dollar in the forecast  which i think is probabl go to materi  and that will give us a bit of assist   and third  frank  i think financi market are readi to react quit abrupt to almost ani chang  and in my view our role should be to make sure that their reaction don t end up be overreact that then forc us to take anoth action     so  at this stage i think languag is probabl better than action  but i also believ we should be quit flexibl and readi to move if the incom data suggest that my outlook here is inaccur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   there are two key question that highlight  at least for me  the challeng in make the forecast and set the cours of polici today   first  is the growth rate in the  book forecast over the next few quarter or the rate of revis in that forecast over the two most recent intermeet period a better guid to what the forecast will be the next  e we meet   if the current  book forecast turn out to be on the mark  we have in my view a relat benign outcom   we would see some of the excess aris from a long period of abov trend growth unwind and would return to near trend growth by        that outcom would contain the risk of higher inflat and like extend the life of this expans  i think there are two way of describ this outcom   the first is as a revers soft land emphas the therapeut valu of a slowdown   the second is a growth recess   we have had around the tabl a bit of discuss of that concept   this emphas the pain associ with rise unemploy  product cutback in area where demand has weaken the most  profit disappoint  declin in equiti valu  and the associ swing in consum and busi confid   but i ll remind you that these are just two differ way of describ the same outcom  howev  onc the economi has slow to below trend  the downsid risk to the forecast that earlier might actual have been welcom  quick becom a sourc of serious concern   and as presid   note  when there is a rapid swing from abov trend growth to below trend growth it becom  as it   at turn point  especi difficult to forecast   the intern    dynam of the economi becom veri hard to anticip   there are danger of inventori cycl just as there are at turn point and  therefor  of overshoot  while avail month data seem consist with the  book forecast for the current quarter  measur of confid in some real  e anecdot report point to downsid risk   in this regard i realli expect that the decemb data may be veri help in get a better handl on whether the slowdown is stabil or deepen   i think an import key will be whether or not product cutback in the fourth quarter make a signific contribut to slow inventori invest  as in the  book forecast   anoth import conting is whether we face a further signific declin in equiti price in respons to addit profit disappoint  the second key issu we face today relat to the possibl  and in my mind strong probabl  that the economi was oper beyond sustain capac befor this loss of momentum   if so  the question is whether that requir a more cautious and measur polici respons to the slowdown to below trend growth than would be the case if the economi were oper close to capac when growth move to below trend   the answer here seem obvious  but perhap the real issu is the level of output relat to potenti and our confid in such a read  those who  like myself  believ we are oper beyond sustain capac welcom a slowdown to below trend growth while appreci the import of not allow a slowdown to escal to one that is either excess or to an outright recess   but certain if i  like governor    believ that   percent was a sustain unemploy rate  i d be right where he is in term of the need to eas quick
thank you  mr  chairman   thing have been move fast recent   two meet ago we thought we might have a real slowdown at hand but could not yet be sure   at the    last meet it was clear that a slowdown was under way but it characterist were not yet ascertain   today we are confront with sever recent week of strong and concern downsid data   while a soften was expect  i have been surpris at the often serious weaken news about auto  consum confid  corpor earn  retail sale  high tech expenditur  and foreign econom growth  among other thing   clear  the balanc of risk has shift substanti downward  howev  consider strength remain  albeit less robust in almost everi sector  while credit extens has slow and asset qualiti concern have appear  bank remain veri healthi  inde  mani interest rate have fallen  which will bol  activ   and while product increas may slow with econom activ  the basic momentum in product growth remain strong  busi invest spend is slow but continu  with capit deepen remain a corpor imper   oil price are eas  but remain shock prone and it must be note  and has alreadi been note  that natur gas price are on a tear   new job are still be creat  although at a slower rate   i would argu that the composit of the declin in the stock market from the intergalact level of a few month ago is more a sign of the market s strength than of it weak  my main worri there is that market price are still veri high by histor standard  i would make two key observ  and each lead to a key question   observ number one  it is clear that the economi is transit to a lower growth level  and within limit this is welcom   question  will this declin bottom out spontan at an accept growth rate  perhap not too far below trend growth  or will it momentum carri it danger lower  observ number two  by most measur inflat is off it low and is slowli rise   question  how will inflat behav in this slowdown  character as it is by an intens competit and    high product growth environ   will inflat stall out quick in this environ or will momentum carri it on up  driven perhap by rise unit labor cost  on balanc  it would seem wise to begin to move to counter the new weak  given all the uncertainti and the lag respons of the economi to polici shift   but how and by how much   make a polici decis today in this situat remind me a bit of how i feel upon check into a hotel room and find it too chilli   i m confront with how to reset a strang thermostat of unknown properti   sever click in the warm direct are avail  but how mani click will most like result in a comfort temperatur when i return in a few hour after a dinner meet   my usual respons is a firm but cautious reset to start with  know that addit warm click are avail if it stay too cool  but minim the likelihood of induc overh and have to spend the night in an unpleas and unnecessari sweat    laughter
vice chair  top that if you can
there is no way i can top that   mr  chairman  the second district   s economi continu to expand  though at a more subdu pace than in some  e  cost and wage pressur persist  but there are few sign that these increas are be pass along to consum   privat sector employ grew at a brisk       percent annual rate in octob  a bit below the third quarter pace  despit declin in manufactur   unemploy rate continu to hold steadi near cyclic low   new york state retail report that same store sale slow somewhat in earli decemb and were run   to   percent ahead of a year ago  led by book  record  and specialti apparel store  avail offici and privat sector data make it clear that the expans is slow to a pace below trend growth   inflat seem quiescent  but it is not decreas   anecdot evid  howev  is overwhelm that the economi is slow consider fa  than the avail data    indic  and the anecdot inform is more forward look   the economi in my view is high like to grow at a slower pace than we had hope to achiev through our polici tighten  it is clear in my view that the balanc of risk has shift and now point to concern about econom weak   for this committe not to note the realiti of the world in which we live would itself be a sourc of instabl   our choic today  it seem to me  is between one of two option   one is a reduct in the fed fund rate  probabl by    basi point  with a statement that the risk are balanc between concern about inflat and about econom weak   altern  we could leav the rate where it is and go to languag express the view that the risk are weight main toward concern about econom weak   i prefer the latter option for two reason  first of all  it   s closer to my own view   second  it give us maximum flexibl to respond to incom data by reduc rate earli next year either at our next meet or beforehand if the data are suffici weak to make the more dramat respons of a move between meet appropri   on the other hand  if the data are not clear in that direct  it also leav us the option of not have to move the rate at all   although a shift in the balanc of risk languag from our current stanc of risk toward inflat to one of risk toward weak in econom growth is rather strong  it realli more clear reflect what is go on in market   i think the market are assum that  as a minimum  we will go to a balanc risk statement   and in the last few day  the view has probabl becom that we will move to languag that the risk are weight toward econom weak   on the other hand  i don t think the bang of the gong of a rate chang at this meet is anticip   now  the market are extraordinarili thin and veri risk avers   and therefor  if we were to do someth that might be deem a bit too dramat  i am not sure what the market reaction would be  especi what the second or third tier reaction would be after the first one   it seem to me that that is a bit more risk than we need to take when there is an option for    us to show that we see what s go on  that we are concern about econom weak  without take the market risk that i think a rate move would involv   thank you
final  presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   in recent week at the st  loui fed we ve had luncheon with invest profession from the st  loui area and with senior offici from biotech firm   the messag from them is veri similar to the one we ve heard around the tabl  one of a great deal of caution   the peopl i ve talk with  howev  do not believ that the economi is sink  just that growth is weaker  not current negat  a somewhat differ view emerg when i talk to my fedex and up contact   the first comment my fedex contact made was that sinc earli novemb there has been a real slowdown on the domest side   their domest packag busi is now up onli   to       percent year over year  and given the rapid growth they had experienc befor  that would mean  if a season adjust seri exist  that it is actual down   both of my contact said that intern busi remain good  but both had the same view of the domest busi   up volum is run   to   percent below what had been project  my fedex contact said that his firm has a lot of the packag busi in the auto  comput  and retail industri   they have check with their custom such as                   and other to see if the slowdown had someth to do with fedex or was an economi wide issu  and their custom all said that the overal economi was slow   my up contact express the same view  on the labor front  both compani have found consider easier condit with onli isol pocket of staf problem   they don t have ani general problem with staf their oper anymor   my fedex contact in particular point out that they no longer have difficulti    recruit and retain peopl in the profession rank   essenti  i think what has happen is that the slowdown in the dot com industri has releas a lot of worker into the marketplac and they are be absorb   it is take a lot of the pressur off the labor market  i think it s correct to say that econom activ in recent week has been surpris slow   and most peopl view the outlook for come month  the first quarter or so  as also like to be slow   howev  there is a general sens of op  about  let s say  the second quarter and beyond among the busi peopl we talk with   but as we look further out into the futur  i think perhap we need to appli more econom analysi becaus my gut feel is that cyclic process are under way   i see these reflect in area like durabl good order and much wider credit spread that are reduc credit avail to more margin borrow   in my view we are observ a fair standard set of cyclic process   but they need not  of cours  end up creat recess if we have a polici respons that is appropri to the chang circumst  i m remind that a coupl of week ago i had the veri pleasant experi of tour the boe f    assembl plant and had about thirti minut in the simul for an f      i must say i m a lot happier sit around this tabl than i am in an f      but in the process of tri to land that plane in the simul of the aircraft carrier  i end up produc what the instructor call  pilot induc oscil     laughter   that mean find oneself wobbl first one way and then the other way   and i think we have some of the same concern about monetari polici   we don t want to overreact
let me ask  did you land or didn t you land
well  i did not end up in the drink   i had some help hand  although on one occas the instructor forgot to put the hook down  so there was no catch on the deck  and we    push the throttl forward and took off again  what it amount to is a     million video game and it s a lot of fun  anyway  we don t want to produc a fed induc polici oscil   i think that is part of our concern   in my view we don t have that situat in front of us for the follow reason  polici is realli posit veri much on one side at the present  e   adjust for risk  the feder fund rate is the highest rate in the market   back in may when we rais it to       percent  some rate were abov and some rate were below   the fund rate was pretti much in the middl and there was room for rate to move substanti in either direct   right now  if we have a resurg in the economi  there is room for longer term rate to rise by     to     basi point without our do anyth   we re not forecast a resurg but if that happen  there s lot of room for rate to rise  i don t think there s much room for the market to take rate lower   outsid of a recess situat  i don t think one could find in the data a term structur more invert than the one we have now   so it seem to me that posit ourselv in the middl requir that we eas a bit   there would still be a lot of room then for rate to rise without a move by us  if it turn out that the economi is about to rebound  that is where i come out and whi i think this is an appropri  e to eas   i d also point out that as of ye day the feder fund market had price in a    percent probabl of an eas at today s meet   i don t know what the fed fund market is do at this moment  obvious  but a probabl of about    percent is not quit half way there but almost   and the probabl look to the februari fed fund futur contract is that by the end of januari we will be more than    basi point along an eas path   an eas of    basi point plus is price into the februari contract  so my bottom line is that we need to reposit ourselv to get back in the middl of the play field again   thank you
thank you veri much   is the coffe out there
yes  it is
let s recess   coffe break
the inform becom avail in the few week sinc your last meet has reinforc the percept that the economi has enter a period of adjust of uncertain dynam and dimens   the committe tighten polici from mid      to mid      in order to slow econom expans to a more sustain pace  this downshift probabl could never have been as smooth a process as some had hope for  as the inventori cycl now take place in auto and elsewher attest   but  in addit  the macroeconom downshift has interact with and has been amplifi by other develop that appear to be sap aggreg demand by consider more than was anticip a few month ago   one of these develop is the persist of high energi price  restrain household spend and busi profit   anoth is the emerg of credit problem for margin busi borrow even befor econom growth moder  lead bank and other lender to have becom more cautious alreadi  a final factor has been an appar reassess of the return  at least in the near term  from produc  own  and oper high tech equip   this reassess is not onli damp busi and household spend on such equip  but  through it effect on equiti price  it is curb demand more broad   signific  as   note  mani of the factor damp demand in the unit state also appear to be at work in other countri  this has kept the dollar from depreci much and will constrain the lift to net export that might ordinarili accompani a weaken in domest demand   in mani respect  as dave note  there would seem to be some countervail posit pressur that provid natur limit on the extent to which mani of these factor will tend to reduc the growth of aggreg demand   continu under strength in structur product growth should support capit invest  incom  and consumpt  a number of the credit problem are the residu of lax lend standard in effect befor the fall of      that have sinc been firm  and energi price probabl will move lower   moreov  fiscal polici seem high like to move in a s ul direct over come year   howev  these support element are work against the interact of slower growth  increas risk avers  declin    equiti price  and erod consum and busi confid that could well weaken demand more than call for by an order adjust to a more sustain suppli and demand balanc   the strength of the forc restrain demand clear has increas sinc your last meet   as a consequ  the committe   s assess of the balanc of risk would seem like to have shift sinc that meet  when you still saw inflat as the more import threat to achiev your long term object  albeit by a smaller margin than at your previous meet this year   the issu the committe face are by how much these risk have chang and what is the appropri respons   announc that the risk were balanc would suggest a relat modest chang in the committe   s percept of econom develop  slight greater prospect for slower econom growth  and part as a consequ  a littl less inflat risk   this is what most market comment expect you to do befor the unfortun wall street journal articl on monday  and balanc risk are rough consist with the staff forecast   in that forecast a steadi feder fund rate produc a gradual approach to the staff   s es  of a sustain level of labor util  with core inflat hold at about current rate  help by declin energi price   ordinarili  one might expect the real feder fund rate to declin as the unemploy rate rise toward it nairu in order to minim overshoot   but in the staff forecast  the real fund rate implicit is seen as not particular high relat to it neutral level  and some continu polici restraint is need to damp the effect on demand of fall energi price  a declin dollar  and more s ul fiscal polici   still  the committe may see downsid risk to the staff outlook for both inflat and output that it may want to take account of in it announc or it action   two key factor ad to pressur on price and produc the rough balanc in the staff forecast are the level of the nairu and the declin in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   if you judg the nairu as like to be lower than   the staff  inflat would tend to diminish  despit the expect fall in the dollar  if econom activ   inde expand more slowli than the growth of potenti as project by the staff   and  while you may believ that the dollar is more like to fall than to rise over  e given the current account deficit  the  e of ani declin is unknow   a steadi dollar  as shown in the  book simul with the staff   s nairu  produc notic less inflat and slower growth in      than in the staff forecast      moreov  in a situat appar character by larg and rapid shift in busi and consum sen ent  in lender percept of risk  in financi asset price  and in the interact of financi market and the real economi  judg the relationship of polici interest rate to econom outcom is even more difficult than usual   in such an environ  the weak tone to some of the veri recent evid on econom develop  includ the appreci downward revis to busi    sale and earn expect  togeth with the decreas in equiti price and the rise in risk premium that have character financi market respons to this inform  may suggest that the current stanc of polici entail a signific risk that the economi will be weaker than you will find accept   this seem to be the view implicit in financi market price  which have built in expect of more than a full percentag point of polici eas next year  begin at the januari meet   if you were reason confid that polici would need to be eas befor long  you might want to get start at this meet   the tighten through last may was necessari in part to counter the effect of op ist earn expect on invest and equiti price   the fade of this op  and the project edg lower of product growth may suggest that rate can now be reduc   the market valu of equiti price has fallen near    percent sinc your may meet  though interest rate on mortgag and invest grade debt have decreas sinc may  those on high yield debt have risen and the dollar has appreci a bit   with long term inflat expect perhap drop signific  judg from the treasuri bond market  even those household and busi face lower nomin rate may be see littl declin in real borrow cost  if they have declin at all  evid on shorter term inflat expect is harder to extract from the market   if such expect also fall  a not unreason respons to a weaken economi  the feder fund rate would need to be reduc at some point just to forestal a firm in polici in real term  and  the spread of credit concern increas into the invest grade area may suggest a risk that credit restraint could becom less select and more pervas   last  if you believ the economi can  in fact  oper on a sustain basi at a lower rate of unemploy than in the staff forecast  even if that rate is a bit abov the current level  a prompt eas could help to forestal an unnecessarili larg rise in the unemploy rate   at the same  e  flat or declin inflat expect and soften labor market should allevi concern about inflat  against this background  the committe may see littl to be gain by wait if it saw high odd that the growth of aggreg demand was still weaken      circumst that had becom serious enough in a short  e to requir immedi action might also be serious enough to warrant an assess that the risk go forward were weight toward econom weak even after polici was eas   the market reaction to a cut in rate coupl with unbalanc risk would be substanti  as market particip built in more and more rapid eas than they have to date  previous  they may have been held back in their forecast of the path of short term rate by percept that the feder reserv would be constrain by it concern about inflat and it assess that the econom slowdown was not excess   a more measur approach  even if the committe were worri about the possibl of slower growth than in the staff forecast  would be to keep rate unchang but announc that you now saw the risk as weight toward econom weak   one reason for adopt this approach is the start point for the economi   it still is oper with veri tight labor market  near the lower end of plausibl es  of sustain valu  if not below   and by mani measur  core inflat has edg higher  perhap close to the upper end of the rang of some committe member    object for inflat over  e   in addit  if product growth is level out  cost pressur could mount in tight labor market   in these circumst  the committe might want to proceed more deliber in eas polici in order to gain greater assur that labor market pressur would abat and inflat would be contain  even if it suspect that the nairu might not be far abov the current level of the unemploy rate   the natur of the recent inform might also counsel caution   a number of the more negat read are from volatil  high frequenc seri  are qualit  in the sens of be anecdot or about confid  or concern earn and sale shortfal that may be measur against expect that may well have been unreach in an economi grow at a sustain pace  inde  mani of the spend and employ data are consist with continu reason econom expans  albeit at a much slower rate than in the first half of the year and below potenti   in the transit to a slower growth economi  which the committe had sought  it is like to be especi difficult to sort out whether the new inform repres excess weak or is most a by product of the desir downshift   last  financi market continu to function reason well  they are by no mean    seiz up      better invest grade firm have been abl to access larg volum of credit at lower interest rate and have issu new equiti   and  in contrast to the circumst in       financi intermediari themselv remain sound  limit the potenti for concern about their health to lead to general restrict on credit avail      in these circumst  you might want greater confirm that the economi is slow by more than you would find accept befor lower interest rate    announc a balanc of risk toward econom weak would itself help to buoy valu in financi market and thus  spend   equiti and bond price should hold ye day   s gain and might ralli further with the confirm that the committe recogn the greater potenti for weak growth and  implicit  was prepar to take action to deal with it   in this regard  if the committe were concern about downsid risk to the economi  through this announc it would realiz a portion of the effect from an eas  without make the immedi commit   thank you  mr  chairman
question for don
two question  don  that may lead into one   at this  e last year  we had a fund rate of       percent   we were realli constrain then from do anyth becaus of y k  but we were learn at that  e of upward revis to growth  reinforc by the anecdot inform that thing were come in much stronger   we now know that we were halfway through a period of over   percent nomin spend growth on averag for the four quarter period   and  clear  a       percent fed fund rate was not consist with that   we agre about that   at the next three meet we move rather prompt and got the fund rate up to       percent   onc we got the rate to       percent  the differ among us were about whether it need to go higher or not  and that had to do with the forecast   now  certain  if i had thought that the economi was go to continu at   plus percent nomin growth  i would have been in the camp  too  that felt our work was not done and that we should keep go   but in fact growth did deceler   when i look at the current  book  i see that we are now  includ the forecast for next year  in a six quarter period of   percent or a littl less in nomin spend growth   and yet the  book assum that a       percent fund rate is consist with nomin spend of   percent or less   how do i get to that assess   how do i close that circl
dave might want to speak to this as well  but in the  book forecast the       percent fund rate is slight restrict   it is consist with the economi grow below the rate of potenti  so the unemploy rate is rise   it is not great restrict  but i think it s slight restrict   and as i note in my remark  the relat high level of the nomin fund rate and the real fund rate is made necessari by the judgment that under structur product growth will remain relat strong so that the equilibrium interest rate is relat high   and there are forc  like more expans fiscal polici  and in particular the assumpt of a depreci dollar  which put upward pressur on price and help to cushion weak in the unit state  that requir a slight restrict stanc of monetari polici
that lead into my second question becaus i read the bluebook as say that the reason for hold the fund rate at       percent is the desir to have the unemploy rate rise to   percent and to hold growth below potenti   so  if you don t want to rais the unemploy rate and hold growth below potenti  then you   d be in favor of reduc the rate   the onli reason i saw in the bluebook for hold the fund rate at       percent was to tri to drive up the unemploy rate
if you were absolut certain about the cours the economi was go to take and there was no uncertainti about the nairu or about the strength of demand  if you key in on these point forecast as what you expect to happen  then i think that rational would carri through   in other word  it would carri through if you just accept everyth in the  book forecast   but there are a lot of uncertainti here   a major issu that was rais in the bluebook was the degre of uncertainti and the extent to which it s veri hard to interpret the incom inform  so in this circumst  and with labor market a littl to the tight side  even if you didn t think the unemploy rate need to go to   percent but you want a littl daylight there to eas inflat    pressur a bit  you might want to proceed with ani eas a littl cautious   even if you didn t intend to get the unemploy rate to   percent  wait six week to reduc the feder fund rate until you had more confirm about the evolv situat wouldn t make veri much differ
one more brief follow up question  am i right that given the  book forecast for inflat  nomin spend  truck  and hous  and everyth els  if the current unemploy rate were   percent  then you would say  cut
and if the nairu were perceiv to be   percent   then that assess probabl would be more like
further question for don   let me start then  there continu to be some diverg of view among committe member  and those view have chang fair signific from where they were two meet ago   not onli have the averag and the median of those view move  but i think the tail of the distribut have move as well   everybodi has move  and the chang are fair uniform and predict among the various member of this committe    laughter   the rate of econom expans has veri clear and unambigu move down dramat from it pace of earlier this year  which was unsustain  to a point where the general view among the member is that if it stabil at it current level it would be sustain   i emphas the word    if it stabil     obvious  becaus the syllog isn t that we had a high degre of unsustain growth at the begin of the year  that growth has move down to a more sustain pace  and therefor everyth is fine   the key question  and one we realli cannot answer  is whether the growth rate has stabil   at this point we cannot know becaus growth has not been at it current rate long enough to exhibit evid of what we would normal call stabil     the problem  as i   ve indic on numer occas and as a number of you have comment  is that we do not have the capabl of reliabl forecast a recess  the reason may be express in the terminolog that dave   use  in term of    nonlinear event     or in term of the analog that i have often employ in the last two or three year  name that pressur may build up on a dam and noth seem to be a problem   but at some point the dam start to crumbl and may do so fair rapid as the water rush out of the system  as inde confid rush out of the econom system   our model do not forecast a recess becaus we build them and fit them in a linear manner so that the coeffici impli multipli effect that are not suffici rapid to offset the other specif of the model  name the adjust process   if we have an economi whose growth rate is declin  our model will have interest rate and cost of capit fall at speed suffici rapid to engend a rebalanc of the economi  often befor it fall into recess  we never actual see the nonlinear event in the model becaus they are defin out of the model  as we have observ on numer occas  such as the oil crise  we have never been abl to use our model structur to forecast a recess out of an oil shock   we ve had three oil shock in recent decad that were follow by recess  there are two possibl explan  either strict unrel chanc event occur  which is possibl  or our model cannot captur the chang that were go on   my own impress is that an oil shock   not necessarili mean we are go to get a recess  but i do think such a shock definit weaken the structur of the economi   and when we add to the latest shock the natur gas electr power generat problem that have emerg  we   re clear observ signific pressur on the economi  the negat effect of the energi shock have occur essenti as a result of a withdraw of demand through either the  import tax  that we   re all familiar with  or as a    consequ of increas domest natur gas cost  clear  no matter what one think about the impact of rise energi price on demand  the increas cost of energi is have an advers effect on corpor profit  that   s basic becaus the declin in the profit margin of nonfinanci  non energi corpor appear to be greater than the improv margin of the energi corpor  moreov  the appar impact of these develop on the capit expenditur of the non energi corpor   not seem to be fulli offset by the obvious increas that we re see in capit outlay in the energi area   part of the problem is the current restraint on the limit resourc avail to the energi sector  such as drill rig   but it is also a result of a veri subdu respons that we are see larg becaus the explor and develop budget of the major energi corpor are to a veri larg extent relat to the west texa intermedi oil price  depend on whether it is abov or below the area of  say      to     a barrel   in previous year when the price went up over      as it did in this particular run  those budget were expand veri rapid and were subsequ cut all the way back  the energi firm have stop do that  as a result  we are get an asymmetr macroeconom respons to the natur gas and electr compon of the cost increas  which have been quit substanti  needless to say  it strike me that we will not know for a good number of week whether the under structur of confid has been breach   we are at a point where we are go to learn whether that is inde the case  becaus if confid has not been breach  the normal recup process  the normal rebalanc process  will gradual elimin the risk   part of the problem is veri obvious stock market price declin  and clear the nasdaq declin have a major impact on the invest of high tech industri   i have gotten call from a number of senior high tech execut who are tell me that the market is dissolv rapid befor their eye   but i suspect that a not inconceiv possibl is that what is dissolv in front of their eye is their own    person net worth    laughter   that   bias one s view of what is happen in the world   so  we have to be a littl care about be seduc by those type of evalu   i ve been hear the same sort of adject that all of you have heard use to describ everyth that is go wrong  and inde we ought to be veri care to recogn that if one could put hard number on the anecdot data we now have  we would not be look at a   percent plus growth rate in gdp   it would be closer to zero   how one read that evid is a question  which we have to consid  at this point i would say that the outlook is for a veri signific subdu rate of inflat and  if anyth  price power in the corpor sector has been fall quit appreci in the last six to eight week  there are some slight disturb price pattern in the consum area  as you know  i don t like the cpi  so let   s stay with the pce implicit deflat   for the first  e we are begin to see some movement in the under rental compon   now  owner equival rent is not exact a market price  it is base on a sampl of market rental   the ratio of rent to valu of properti  which has been go down progress quarter after quarter  now final seem to be show that the expans in asset price may be begin to spill over into consum price  i think the medic cost increas we are see are real   they are dollar figur   but the divis of medic cost between price and volum  i m almost certain  is terribl bias toward an inflat that   not exist  in my view  the inflat rate for the noncorpor sector  which is well abov that for the corpor sector  is not a reflect of real inflat in medic price becaus there s veri littl evid that the under structur of such price is acceler   inde  everi analyst who   a microanalysi of a specif price categori in the medic servic area conclud that the data we see on medic price inflat are grossli overvalu   and with medic technolog chang the way it is  we are have veri littl in the way of medic price inflat  if such inflat is measur proper   even so  there is no question that we are see veri signific    inflat in medic cost  and to the extent that those cost feed into labor compens they have an impact on price   but  if anyth  that process is not acceler at this particular stage   and inde what we re see in the implic for inflat expect in the tip spread is that irrespect of the price level from which we start  inflat expect have clear come down about     percentag point   how much of that truli repres an under declin in inflat expect is an arguabl issu becaus the tip implicit price deflat is fundament an arguabl issu to begin with  in ani event  when we look at what s go on in the economi and recogn that we have almost a    go no go    possibl over the next number of week with respect to how this econom deterior is go to play out  it seem pretti evid that what we want to be sure of  whatev we decid  is that we not end up with a symmetr or balanc risk statement  that is not the way it look out there   if we were to decid to reduc the fund rate by    basi point today  which i don t think is a good idea  we still should adopt  in my judgment  a balanc of risk statement weight toward the down side   that   s becaus with whatev move we make  whether it   s    basi point or someth els  a symmetr risk statement would impli that we have finish our adjust process  and that conclus in my judgment would be mistaken  so i think the real choic here are    basi point plus asymmetri toward the down side or zero chang now with downsid asymmetri and the understand that it is quit conceiv that we may have to have a telephon confer and move the rate befor the next meet   that s becaus we may find in this interv the answer concern whether or not the declin in the rate of econom growth has stabil  what i conclud at the end of the day is that we need to recogn that we realli do not know the answer for the intermedi period   i would encapsul that into no chang in the fund    rate  but with a bias toward the down side and the recognit that  if the eros continu  we veri like will have to move befor the next meet   and that move would be trigger  i would presum  by a telephon confer some  in the earli day of januari  the first week or mayb the second week at the latest   given the uncertainti that we face and the general tenor of what i ve heard around the tabl this morn  that strike me as the best thing that we should do for the moment  vice chair
mr  chairman  i agre fulli with both the conclus you   ve reach and the reason for them   i believ that the most import thing in public life is to know what you don   t know   and we don t in fact know enough at this point to move the rate downward   do so would be unwis  in my view  especi for the reason i cite earlier  the market are just too thin   but i think we have to have the balanc of risk toward concern for econom weak  and we have to be veri flexibl dure the month of januari as you have suggest
mr  chairman  as you know from my earlier comment  i would have prefer to reduc the feder fund rate at this meet by    basi point   let me tri to put my posit this way   on the issu of when to eas we can ask the question in two way   obvious  the market fulli expect an eas at the begin of next year  and one question to ask is what differ   it make if we eas now rather than wait   but we can put the question the other way around  what differ   it make if we wait six week   it s hard to imagin that six week make ani real differ   the extent to which it may make a differ has to have someth to do with expect and public attitud   in my view  in term of public attitud and expect about our polici move  there are ampl data in hand now to justifi eas   that is  i don t think    anyon would say that we are make a mistak by act at this point   on the other hand  probabl the singl most promin piec of inform we   re go to get that bear on this polici issu is the decemb employ report that will come out at the begin of januari   if that show weak  veri low employ growth or a declin in employ  i think there will be a great deal of pressur  probabl within the committe and in the public at larg  for us to respond   quit frank  i believ it would be better for us to anticip that develop rather than wait until we have such a piec of negat news   as i said befor  i think there s ampl space for rate to move up and not much space for them to move down   so  i would prefer to see us posit ourselv in the middl  as i indic earlier
mr  chairman  i too would prefer move now   i think the fund rate is high and the effect has been to slow the economi as intend   in my view a quarter point reduct in the rate now would still leav us with a tight polici  one that continu to slow the economi  and yet it would recogn the risk that we ve talk about around the tabl   i believ it is like that we will have a confer call and that we will lower rate at that point   and certain we can wait until then
mr  chairman  i can certain accept your recommend   when i was think about that possibl at the end of last week  i was concern that the market might find it a bit confus in term of what we are tri to communic   iron  as it turn out  the articl that appear in the wall street journal may make that less of a problem   in addit  it seem to me that our press statement should be veri care word becaus my concern is that the market might be a littl confus about how weak we think the economi is and might rais the issu of whi    we didn t chang the fund rate today   so  how our decis is written up could be an import element in term of the success of your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a slight differ of opinion with my colleagu  mr  parri  on the wall street journal articl   i consid that articl veri unfortun becaus when leak like that occur i think it make us look bad as a central bank   we   ve had this discuss befor   so  i don t see ani good side to it  get back to the subject at hand  clear we are in a situat where we re all concern that the slow that we want to see and are now see is go to be excess   as you and other have point out  no one know with certainti whether further weaken will occur becaus of the complex of our economi and the interact of the financi market  consum confid  and all the other factor that we discuss   i agre that the anecdot point to a much lower rate of growth than do our model at this  e   but they are anecdot  and i think we   d all like to see some more evid in the data and other inform we receiv that would help clarifi the situat   in a period of uncertainti like this  the increment approach seem appropri and i agre with your recommend for no chang in rate but an asymmetr statement that the risk are weight toward econom weak at this  e
mr  chairman  i thought the articl was abomin
now you agre   so do i
mr  chairman  i would prefer not to eas today   i don t know how you score me on your note pad  but in the go around i was tri to convey that i came with a view that    a balanc risk statement would be the proper first move   my staff would tell you that we were debat until i left for the airport whether the slowdown was as broad as we were begin to sens and whether the uneasi was as great as we sens and  therefor  whether the recommend you made would be the appropri move  vice chairman   captur my view that an eas today  although i suspect that s where we are head  is too much too soon   to the extent that part of what is go on is that peopl are recalibr from expect of       and   percent gdp as relat to hous and auto and cruis ship or whatev  i think that s someth we ought to let play out   so i think your recommend is the right one   thank you  mr  chairman
i support your propos for the reason you state  mr  chairman  as presid   indic  it   s also import that we recogn what we don t know and not communic to the marketplac someth that we didn t intend to convey by move at this point
thank you  mr  chairman   as you know  the polici you suggest is not my first choic   obvious  there is a lot of uncertainti out there  but i share the view of a few other around the tabl who think that we ve seen enough to eas fair soon   on the other hand  if we all agre to stand by our telephon   laughter  the polici you suggest  morph  into what i would prefer  so i will support it on that basi   but i think we ought to be alert and stand by our telephon
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain don t want to be predict but i suppos i am in this regard
sorri about that   i was just report as a statistician
what do they say about consist be the hobgoblin of someth  i m also not in favor of retain ani particular polici sole to move the unemploy rate up   i don t know where the nairu is  i don t know whether anyon realli know where it is right now  but i do continu to see resourc constraint in labor market  and they have been a constraint on growth for some industri   i think the current slow could potenti lead to a resolut of this whole problem  anoth issu that peopl have focus on relat to financi condit  widen credit spread and the level of real interest rate   i m in harmoni with jack guynn on the idea that credit market right now are reflect of the last loan made when spread were realli narrow in      and earli        and in an environ of general healthi bank condit  i don t view them as a problem   i think that bankabl credit are get bank  where should real interest rate be  that s a t i question when we   re move from a period of veri rapid growth to one of slower growth in an environ of strong under product   so it s hard for me to look at the level of the fed fund rate right now and see it as a problem all by itself  i agre that we have to wait and see   i would have been abl to vote for a balanc risk statement  but i can also go with a statement of the grow sens of uncertainti on the down side   i just think we ought not to let all the strength that s still in the economi be forgotten in the face of what are larg anecdot and expect relat data   they could turn if the market receiv what we do today veri favor   so i think the wait and see attitud is the right one   hope we won t have to stand by our telephon
well  you have to stand by  you just don t have to answer   laughter
no  i intend on answer
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
presid  n
i general support your recommend   let me briefli make two other comment   first  i do share some of bob parri   s concern that a statement about risk weight toward econom weak is go to rais the question of whi didn t we act now   hope  we will have some languag in the announc that will at least give a sens of our reason  second  and this is a point i   ve made befor  i think we soon ought to consid put at least one nail in the nairu coffin   not onli has the economi fail to perform accord to that framework in the last five or six year but  so far as i m awar  go back    or    year there just is no evid of an empir relat between labor market condit and inflat
mr  chairman  let me say first that i can accept your propos   i definit recogn the downsid risk and i am get the same kind of messag as everyon els   my prefer would have been to have a balanc risk statement   my concern with this move is that it is not yet fulli price in the market   and i think it will be seen by some as a fair aggress move toward eas in the context of an histor low unemploy rate and a labor market situat that is tight by histor standard   that could set up a seri of expect  which could put us in a box if confid is not yet breach  to use your phrase  and the economi begin to show some strength go forward   but i can accept your propos   i would recommend    and would hope that the press statement that accompani our announc includ languag make it clear that we are not yet panick  that it   s not a foregon conclus that we   re necessarili go to eas further   i guess that comment was predict    laughter
we are not yet panick
i don t think we will make you our press secretari
i m express my prefer
thank you  mr  chairman   jack guynn said he was still debat when he left for the airport ye day   i m still debat now   clear  base on what i said earlier  if the reason for not lower the fund rate is becaus we re wait for the unemploy rate to go up  then i can t agre with that   so if the press statement is go to make ani refer to continu tight in the labor market  then i would disagre with that   but i guess i won t know what the press statement is go to say until after we vote on this   so i may have to guess as to how it will
i can tell you that the preliminari press statement   not includ such a refer
okay   the other reason for not move is becaus it s awkward to go from a balanc of risk toward inflat to a balanc risk statement  which would seem to be out of tune with realiti   i would find that troubl   and i ve alway thought that whenev we reach the point where we had to announc a balanc of risk toward weak and we didn t act  it was go to be a problem for us   it put the burden on us to explain whi we didn t do anyth if we saw the balanc of risk as weight toward weak  whi we didn t act is go to have to be explain  whether we do it in the press statement or in remark peopl make subsequ
may i ask you a question   whi don t we have that problem  no matter which direct we see the risk  everi  e we move to an asymmetr statement
that s whi i don t like be asymmetr
okay   sorri    laughter
he is veri consist
i know  speaker      he is veri predict    laughter
and my final point  speak of predict  is that what appar is expect out there is that we would chang the languag this  e  and then everybodi could read into that that we would chang polici the next  e   and i don t like be predict    laughter  i would like to do the unpredict thing  what is not fulli anticip in the market today  and that is to lower the rate   i think that would give us a lot more mileag than wait to eas until after it s well anticip that we will eas at the next meet or in between meet
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend for the reason you put forward  which in some sens has tend to be forgotten as we ve gone around the tabl   we are in a period  i believ  of great uncertainti   and i think it s not illegi  for us to recogn some uncertainti by say that we tend to think the risk are in one direct   on the other hand  it s not inappropri to wait for a littl confirm   when we origin thought through this complex set of issu on the languag and so forth  we all knew we might get in this posit   and as abomin as that terribl articl was in the wall street journal  i think it did get the concept  and lo and behold the world did not fall apart     so i m actual veri comfort with exact where you are   it reflect uncertainti and it reflect the realiti of a tough convers   the market will not think us foolish for not jump base on what is anecdot evid  but we are warn them  or in some sens mayb comfort them  that we are awak and aliv and if thing work out in a certain way  we   re prepar to respond   so i am quit comfort with your propos
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   i continu to believ that a period of below trend growth is construct  but i m mind of the downsid risk we face today   i think one reason for be cautious about move immedi is that the market alreadi anticip a move earli next year and a cumul eas of     basi point over the cours of next year   i don t think we should do or say anyth at this meet that would disconfirm or unwind those expect  but neither do i believ that it would be particular construct to escal them further   so  i think this is the right move for now   but this period of uncertainti is a  e when the incom data may be veri reveal  and an intermeet move could certain be a possibl
predict  let me say that a quarter point is not much  and i realli think we need to get start earlier rather than later   i agre with most of what bill pool said about the current situat   one thing he said was that we are not go to learn much in earli januari except the employ unemploy number   we actual had a declin in employ last month on the household measur   you onc said  mr  chairman  that we alway make one move too mani   if we lower the fund rate a quarter point now  we   d remov just half of our last increas   if we expect to act by telephon  i m afraid it will look as if we decid at that point that we made a    mistak today   on the other hand  i came into this meet expect the outcom to be a balanc risk statement and this is better than that    laughter
i think a major is in favor of no chang in rate and the balanc of risk toward the down side  read the appropri languag
the word is on page    of the bluebook    the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around       percent    and for the balanc of risk sentenc in the press releas   against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth  and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk are weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur

let me indic that the next meet is go to be a rather yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes long one becaus our agenda is quit lengthi   we will be meet at   a m  on both tuesday and wednesday  which is longer than usual  so i ll give you all a head up   let s go to lunch
oh  i m sorri   that tell you how hungri i am    laughter
could i suggest a chang in one word
the seventh line begin with  financi market suggest that econom   it say  growth  and i   d like to substitut  activ    the reason is that we are  i believ  still argu and are main of the view that we continu to be in the midst of a product shock   i think this is more about activ than growth
what s the opinion     anybodi support that
i d rather be redund than mislead
i think most peopl  unlik expert  understand growth more than activ
i don t know whether slow activ actual mean a declin
slow activ mean the level as distinct from
yes  as oppos to the growth
what we basic would be say is that the economi is go down   we don t have that view
we think we have moder growth
further suggest   if not  let s go to lunch  end of meet
