good afternoon  everybodi   let me be the first to welcom denni   sit in for the feder reserv bank of atlanta   we   ll start with bill
thank you  mr  chairman   financi market have becom much more turbul sinc the last meet   especi in subprim mortgag and associ secur  in u s  and global equiti  and in foreign exchang market  the good news is that market have general remain liquid and well function  with a minor except on the new york stock exchang on februari      moreov  there are few sign of signific contagion from the subprim mortgag market into the rest of the mortgag market or from subprim mortgag credit spread to corpor credit spread more general   in general  the debt market have been most unruffl by recent develop   i plan to focus my attent on four major market develop   first  the substanti turmoil in the subprim mortgag market   i talk about the risk that this market might unravel at the januari fomc meet  that certain occur more quick and more forc than i anticip   second  i want to talk a littl about the declin in u s  equiti price and the accompani rise in actual and impli price volatil   third is the sharp correct in the so call    carri trade    in foreign exchang market   the low interest rate currenc such as the yen and the swiss franc have appreci  with the greatest move come against their higher yield counterpart   final  i   ll talk a bit about the sharp downward shift in market expect about the path of the feder fund rate target over the next year and a half   two key question motiv my comment   first  is the market turbul driven main by fundament develop  or   it reflect main a shift in the risk appetit of investor   second  what is the ongo risk of contagion from the market area that has experienc the most stress   the subprim mortgag market   to other market   regard the subprim mortgag market  the deterior appear driven most by fundament develop   as you know  the delinqu rate for subprim adjust rate mortgag have risen sharpli   in contrast  as shown in exhibit   of the handout  there has been littl chang in delinqu rate for fix rate mortgag  most signific  delinqu rate for the      vintag of subprim adjust rate mortgag have climb unusu quick   as shown in exhibit    the last vintag that went this bad so fast was the      vintag  and that had a much differ econom environ   one character by a mild recess and a rise unemploy rate   the deterior in the qualiti of subprim mortgag credit has led to a sharp widen in credit spread for the abx index   the abx index    materi use by mr    is append to this transcript  appendix     repres the cost of default protect on a basket of collater debt oblig that are backstop main by subprim mortgag   as shown in exhibit    although this widen has been most pronounc at the bottom end of the credit qualiti spectrum  bbb minus and bbb   it has rippl upward to the higher rate tranch that are better protect   exhibit   show how the credit deterior initi regist in the abx index as market particip sought to buy protect   in milder form  this deterior also regist in the under collater debt oblig and asset back secur   the widen of the credit spread in the abx index was probabl exagger by the fact that there was an asymmetri between the mani that were seek loss protect and the few that were will to write protect   this can be seen in two way   first  as shown in exhibit    the spread widen was more pronounc in the abx index than in either under collater debt oblig or asset back secur   second  as shown in exhibit    the abx spread have come down a bit from their peak even as the under market for subprim mortgag  as reflect in the ongo viabil of mani mortgag origin  has continu to deterior   the deterior in the subprim market has undermin the econom of subprim mortgag origin and securit   this is especi true for those mortgag origin with poorer underwrit track record   their loan can no longer be sold at a suffici premium to par valu to cover their origin cost   in addit  the cost that they must incur to replac loan that have default earli have increas sharpli   in sever case  these difficulti have caus bank to pull their warehous line of credit   sever of the larg monolin origin are bankrupt  distress  or up for sale   they are highlight in red in exhibit     moreov  sever of the diversifi lender  such as hsbc  have indic that they are tighten credit standard and pull back from this sector   the result is that the volum of subprim mortgag origin is like to fall sharpli this year   perhap drop one third or more from the      rate of slight more than      billion   this tighten of credit avail to subprim borrow is like to manifest itself through a number of channel   these channel includ     a drop in hous demand  as borrow who would have been abl to get credit in      no longer qualifi under now toughen underwrit standard      an increas in hous suppli  as the rate of hous foreclosur increas  notabl  the mortgag banker associ report last week that the rate of loan enter the foreclosur process in the fourth quarter of      reach a record level of      percent  the highest level in the histori of the thirti seven year old survey   and     addit downward pressur on home price  which in turn threaten to increas the magnitud of credit problem  delinqu  and foreclosur   in consid these channel  it is import to emphas that the credit strain in the subprim sector are unlik to have peak yet   the reset risk on the adjust rate portion of the subprim loan origin in      and      will be felt main over the remaind of      and        most of the adjust rate loan are fix for two year at low    teaser    rate   when yield adjust upward onc the teaser rate period is over  some borrow may have insuffici resourc to servic these debt   the good news   at least to date   is that spillov into the alt a mortgag and conform mortgag area is veri mild  both in term of credit spread and in term of loan perform   although there has been some rise in delinqu and foreclosur rate for higher qualiti residenti mortgag  these rate are still low both qualit and histor   moreov  there is littl evid that the subprim problem have hurt mortgag loan volum   for exampl  the mortgag banker associ index of mortgag applic for purchas has increas in the past three week   turn next to the u s  equiti market  it is less clear cut whether the declin in price and the rise in volatil are fundament base   as sever observ have note  equiti valuat do not appear to be excess   if that is the case  then whi have equiti been more turbul than corpor and emerg market debt  for which spread remain unusu narrow   although this point is legi   two fundament develop that make u s  equiti price less attract deserv mention   first  equiti analyst have been reduc their earn forecast for       although the top down view of the equiti strategist for the s p     index has not chang much  on a bottom up basi  earn expect have drop sharpli  as shown in exhibit    the aggreg forecast of the individu sector analyst now indic a growth rate in s p     earn for      of about   percent  down from about   percent at the begin of the year   in contrast  s p     earn have grown at an annual rate of more than    percent for four consecut year   it should be no surpris that fall earn expect could weigh on equiti price  second  uncertainti about the growth outlook has increas   this show up clear  for exampl  in our most recent primari dealer survey   becaus greater uncertainti about the growth outlook presum impli greater risk  the rise in uncertainti should   all els be equal   result in lower share price   in contrast  it is easier to explain the modest widen of corpor credit spread   in theori  lower share price and higher volatil impli a greater risk of default  which should impli wider credit spread   corpor credit spread have behav in a manner consist with this   josh rosenberg from the research group at the feder reserv bank of new york recent investig this issu   he found that the spread widen in the high yield corpor debt sector was consist with past period in which the impli volatil for equiti rose sharpli   exhibit   summar one key result   the widen in the bb rate corpor spread in the week after the februari    retrench was of a magnitud similar to that of other instanc in which impli equiti price volatil as measur by the vix index rose sharpli   in the most recent episod  the vix index rose     basi point  and the bb corpor spread rose    basi point   this rise compar with an averag rise of    basi point in the bb spread in the ten case in which the vix rose most sharpli   the rise in the most recent episod is well within the rang of histor experi   in mani other area in which asset price have move sharpli  risk reduct effort appear to have play the biggest role   for exampl  in the foreign exchang market  the biggest currenc move were in the currenc pair associ with so call carri trade  such as the yen and swiss franc for the low yield currenc and the australian and new zealand dollar for the high yielder   exhibit   indic the chang in the yen versus the australian dollar  the new zealand dollar  the euro  the british pound  and the u s  dollar dure three separ period   the week befor the februari    stock market selloff  the week of the stock market selloff  and the past two week   the high yield currenc appreci the most dure the run up to the februari    selloff  fell the most dure the februari    week  and have recov the most against the yen over the past two week   the chang in specul posit in foreign exchang futur market tell a similar stori  exhibit   show the chang in the share of the open interest posit held by particip in the noncommerci futur market   over the past few week  net short posit as a percentag of the overal open interest in the yen have drop  and long posit in the british pound and australian dollar have drop   an examin of how treasuri yield  stock price  exchang rate  and credit spread have move also indic that risk reduct effort have been import  exhibit    show the correl of daili price and yield movement in      befor februari      as one can see  the correl were quit low   in contrast  the correl matrix in exhibit    show the correl of daili price move for the period begin on februari      most of the correl have climb sharpli  suggest that risk posit is drive price and yield movement   final  short term interest rate expect have shift substanti sinc the last fomc meet   as shown in exhibit     near term expect have shift  with market particip now expect a modest reduct in the feder fund rate target by late summer   howev  the feder fund rate futur curv is still abov the curv at the  e of the decemb fomc meet   in contrast  longer term expect have shift more sharpli  with a larger move toward eas   as shown in exhibit     the june      june      eurodollar calendar spread is now invert by about    basi point   this calendar spread is more invert than it was at the  e of the decemb      fomc meet   compar with the shift in market expect  the forecast of primari dealer have not chang much   exhibit    and    compar dealer expect with market expect befor the januari fomc meet and befor this meet   the horizont bold line repres market expect   the blue circl repres the differ dealer forecast   the   circl repres the averag dealer forecast for each period   the two exhibit illustr sever noteworthi point   first  the averag dealer forecast has not chang much sinc the januari fomc meet   the   circl in the two chart are in virtual the same posit   second  the amount of dispers among the dealer    forecast has not chang much   in fact  the rang of the blue circl is slight narrow current   although mani dealer now mention that their uncertainti about the growth outlook has increas  that   not appear to have been reflect in their modal forecast   third  there is now a substanti gap between the dealer    averag forecast and market expect   the gap between the horizont bold line  which repres market expect  and the   circl  which repres the averag dealer   s view  has increas   whi is there a larg gap between the dealer    forecast and market expect    i think there are three major explan   first  the dealer    forecast are modal forecast and do not reflect the downsid risk that mani dealer now believ have emerg in the growth outlook  second  dealer forecast often lag behind econom and market develop   onli when    downsid risk    grow big enough to pass some threshold are dealer like to alter their modal forecast   third  some of the downward shift in market expect may repres risk reduct effort   an investor with specul risk posit that would be vulner to econom weak might hedg these risk by buy eurodollar futur contract   this hedg could push the impli yield on eurodollar futur contract lower than what would be consist with an unbias forecast of the like path of the feder fund rate   nevertheless  the potenti gap between market expect and the committe   s interest rate expect may pose a bit of a conundrum for the committe   if the committe were to shift the bias of it statement in the direct of neutral  market expect with respect to eas would undoubt be pull forward and might becom more pronounc   after all  most dealer expect that the committe will not chang the inflat bias of the januari fomc statement   in contrast  keep the bias unchang in order to keep market expect from shift further in the eas direct might be inconsist with the committe   s assess of the relat risk regard growth and inflat   if the committe were to keep the bias unchang even when it view had chang  the communic process might be impair   on a housekeep note  i wish to bring to the committe   s attent the chang to the    morn call    with the trade desk   they were discuss in a memo distribut to the committe last week   under the new format  which we plan to implement on thursday  the call will be open to all member of the committe  and you will have the option of particip in the      a m  discuss of reserv manag issu  the      a m  portion cover recent develop in global market  or both portion   the march    memo outlin the new procedur for join these call   final  there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the januari fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
thank you   are there question for bill either about the outlook or the housekeep matter   presid
bill  you talk about subprim mortgag in some detail but not about alt a mortgag in great detail   my understand is  and i just want to check to see whether i   m correct  that    percent of the      purchas dollar origin were alt a  rough the same percentag as subprim   it   s my further understand that    percent of the alt a origin were no document or low document loan   how much confid do you have   and i can tell by your reaction that there   s a question   that alt a mortgag are not as peril as subprim   if you don   t have confid or if they are peril  what consequ might ensu
well  unfortun  the inform on the alt a market is not veri good  in fact  there is disagr about exact what an alt a mortgag is   if you can   t defin it  it   s pretti hard to measur   that is problem number one   a good way of think about the mortgag market is as a continuum of loan qualiti extend from  at the bottom  the worst underwritten subprim mortgag that are adjust rate up to the conform mortgag that we alway associ with the gses  with alt a somewher in the middl   obvious  to the extent that the hous market deterior and home price don   t go up  there will be more strain on the alt a market  but i don   t get a sens that we will see the kind of underwrit problem that we have seen in the subprim mortgag area   as of this date  we don   t see a lot of evid of a signific problem in that area  but  again  we don   t have veri good inform  and we   ll have to wait and see
may i ask of bill  mr  chairman  that we continu the analysi on this front and keep probe
this is a continu of the same question becaus i was intrigu by your chart that show      sixti day and over delinqu for subprim arm track with        i don   t recal the world as we know it come to an end in the subprim market in       but i also wonder how big the subprim market was and how much it might have been character by some of the rather difficult practic that we know went on  particular from the middl of       through the end of the year
you   re absolut right   the market was much smaller at that  e   i would character the deterior that you saw in      as probabl most driven by the macroeconomi  and the deterior that you saw in      as driven most by two thing   more laxiti in the underwrit process and a chang in the trajectori of home price   so i think the caus of the deterior in the two case were quit differ   the subprim mortgag market in      is sever  e the size of the origin in       so obvious it will have a bigger consequ
you made a distinct at the begin between someth that was fundament and someth that was about a chang in risk percept   just conceptu  how do you distinguish between those two thing   is the latter someth that you can   t attribut to a chang in observ econom condit
the distinct i   d make between fundament and risk reduct is that the latter occur when peopl adjust their portfolio not becaus they chang their view about the qualiti of a particular asset but becaus they are reduc the amount of risk exposur to the market that they want to have   so when you have a big event like februari     obvious volatil goe up  and so valu at risk goe up  and you may decid to reduc your risk   so you   re go to sell all sort of thing  and the price of those thing you sell will go down regardless of whether you   ve actual chang your opinion about them in ani meaning way   whi did corn price on februari    fall   percent   it was probabl becaus corn price had been in a big bull market  peopl had risk posit in corn  and so they want to get out of those posit
i guess my question is  how do you know
you don   t
you don   t know   thank you
you don   t know with certainti   you make an infer
mr  chairman  may i follow up
bill  one of the factor you said that might account for the gap between the primari dealer expect about the fed fund rate at differ horizon and the averag market price might be the flight to qualiti   it   s not quit a flight to qualiti  but it reflect the demand for safer asset
or asset that would do well in a bad econom environ as a hedg to the rest of your risk
a flight to liquid or someth like that   do you think the same stori might account for what happen in far forward interest rate in the treasuri market as well   would you say that perhap the same kind of phenomenon might account for that
go out on the curv to ten year  it   s possibl   the eurodollar market is probabl the most liquid market in which one could do this veri  veri quick   so i guess i would view what happen in the longer date treasuri is probabl more reflect of emerg downsid risk to the economi  but there   s probabl some of the flight to liquid as well   i think it   s hard to tell
what institut or quantit constraint are there on trader who would be posit to take the other side of the movement into eurodollar futur for the hedg oper   you paint a pictur of everyon know that the fed fund rate path is abov what   s impli by eurodollar futur and of no one be abl to pan that out of the market
well  anoth explan is that the economist who make the dealer forecast are not the trader who execut the eurodollar futur posit   so that   s a possibl altern explan   general  there   s a disequilibrium   a number of peopl that i   ve talk to in the market have said that this is what they thought was go on  and they advis me not to take what was go on in the eurodollar futur market liter becaus they felt that some of them were put on these posit in case of a bad scenario that led to signific reduct in short term interest rate   so i   m basic take the explan somewhat on the advic of market particip who told me that they were do this
let me just follow up   i look at eurodollar futur everi day   you   re an experienc  savvi market guy and i want to learn how to understand these market   my presumpt would be that  if that take place  there   s someth limit the capit of peopl who could take the offset posit   how could market be so out of whack for so long
let me just say for the record that i don   t think bill is say that the market is mispric the valu
i thought that was clear what he said
i think he is just say that the primari dealer whom we survey  who are a strang group   laughter  have a view that   s somewhat differ from the view of the market
no  he said that peopl told him not to take the eurodollar price as indic of the expect valu of the eurodollar rate at that date   is that what you were say  you said    disequilibrium      i   m tri to understand how financi market work here
when peopl are in risk reduct mode  they don   t want to take on more risk   so there may be an imbal temporarili between those who want to hedg versus those who want to take more risk   to take the other side of that bet  they   re basic increas their risk   the abx market is anoth exampl of that   whi did the abx index go to a       yield spread   well  it was part becaus a lot more peopl want to buy protect in the subprim mortgag market than want to sell it   in a perfect econom world  it should be arbitrag away  but i think there are case where that just  sn   t necessarili happen
i think it   s the other point  presid    about how much confid you put in the   dot  which are the survey of  to use the vice chairman   s word  that strang group that the new york fed contact
this isn   t about the   dot   this is about the eurodollar
no  no  no   becaus primari dealer    economist  quit often  probabl are report their modal forecast becaus they   re tell a stori about where the committe was go forward and paint an overal pictur of the economi  wherea the eurodollar contract reflect averag across all the state of natur   what we see when we look at option is a grow downsid tail   so it could be the emerg of that signific downsid tail  which economist will talk about as a risk to their outlook but trader actual have to price  as anoth reason that those two thing are diverg
that   s help   but  still  apart from the   dot  he   s tell us there   s some mispric that   s systemat
it   s a possibl explan   vinc   s explan  which i made in fact in my prepar remark  is probabl one i would put a greater weight on
i just want to get back to the subprim market for a quick question  there have been a lot of newspap stori about peopl who default on the first payment in these mortgag  which is a bit of a puzzl to me  unless it   s just pure fraud   i was just wonder if you had ani inform about whether there has been an increas in fraud here or whether there are other reason for peopl default on the veri first payment on their mortgag
first  a simpl explan   i don   t know if this is correct   is that  if home price are go up and you   re get     percent loan to valu  you   re get basic a free option to see if the home price will keep go up   if they don   t go up  you decid  okay  thank you veri much for your loan  and i   m not go to make ani payment   so probabl some peopl are specul   certain  there have been anecdot report of investor who were do this   second  there probabl has been fraud   i mean  there are exampl of peopl who were obtain mortgag for other peopl  when they weren   t the true beneficiari of the loan
have you seen ani data or hard evid on this
actual  michael  the ceo of a larg bank that origin mortgag  with whom i had a convers  comment that this indic is a bit confus becaus it has to do with the fact that the owner of these loan chang   by the  e the person make the first payment  it is a struggl to figur out to whom that payment goe   so the mortgag show up as default with the end owner  but the person did make the payment   the payment just didn   t get to the right place   so the ceo said that we need to be care about make too much of that number becaus it   s more of an account issu than it is peopl actual default on their first payment
that is a fair point   in fact  that   s whi we like to look at sixti day plus delinqu and tri to push peopl away from look at thirti day   it take  e for the payment to find the actual loan holder
he mention that a number of   percent was attach to first payment in default and that number is just way out of whack
i had been puzzl about the quantit relationship between the subprim problem and the stock market   i think that the actual money at risk is on the order of     billion from default on subprim  which is veri small compar with the capit of the stock market   it look as though a lot of the problem is come from bad underwrit as oppos to some fundament in the economi   so i guess i   m a bit puzzl about whether it   s a signal about fundament or how it   s link to the stock market
it   s hard to know how connect the subprim market and the stock market have been in the past month or two   clear  peopl are nervous about the posit feedback loop of less mortgag origin lead to less hous demand lead to lower home price lead to a weaker economi   and then that feed into corpor earn and disappoint on the corpor earn side   i don   t think ani of us know exact how power those linkag are  but that   s probabl at least one element that equiti investor are worri about
anyon have ani question about the call procedur  are there ani other question   then we need a vote to ratifi domest oper
so move  speaker   second
without object   thank you   it   s  e for the econom situat   dave
thank you  mr  chairman   on the whole  the staff forecast has surviv the econom news and financi event of the past seven week reason well   although we revis down our project for the growth of real activ  we don   t realli see the fundament of the economi as have chang signific over the intermeet period   inde  our forecast for the growth of real gdp for      has been fluctuat in the   to    percent rang sinc last august  and this latest revis has onli return us to the lower end of that relat narrow rang   still  i   ll admit that i   ve been experienc someth like the pang of a nervous flier   for the most part  my anxieti have been held in check by an econom ride that has proceed relat smooth along the anticip flight path   but each episod of turbul seem to trigger the panick thought that economi  like plane  realli do crash from  e to  e   don   t worri   i will spare you anoth episod of self psychoanalysi  laughter   loosen my grip on the armrest  and concentr this afternoon on a dispassion analysi of recent event and their implic for the econom outlook   i must say  we have had some import develop with which to contend   weaker econom data  higher oil price  problem in subprim mortgag market  and a drop in equiti valuat   among the weak report  one that was not a surpris to us was the downward revis in the bea   s es  of fourth quarter gdp   as you will recal  one of the major differ between our januari forecast of a     percent increas in fourth quarter real gdp and the bea   s advanc es  of a     percent increas was their much higher figur for inventori invest   while i am certain that it was more luck than skill  the incom inventori data for the fourth quarter were veri close to our expect and far below the bea   s figur   account for a sizabl fraction of their downward revis to real gdp   that was import becaus a central element in our stori is that  although some inventori buildup have develop in recent month  product adjust are occur prompt enough to prevent the emerg of a full blown inventori cycl that could caus a period of subpar growth to morph into an econom downturn  inventori sale ratio rose notic over the second half of last year  as the growth of final demand shift down   the problem were most appar in the motor vehicl industri   but aggress cut in motor vehicl assembl in the second half of last year and earli this year combin with a reason stabl pace of sale in the neighborhood of      million unit appear to have put this problem larg behind us  judg by the increas in product schedul for the second quarter  the automak seem to share that view   inventori also back up in a wide varieti of construct relat industri  and substanti cut in the product of construct suppli occur in the fourth quarter   but we still see inventori problem linger here   more recent  some sign of excess stockbuild have extend beyond motor vehicl and construct suppli  most notabl in machineri  electr equip  applianc  and furnitur   as a consequ  we expect manufactur output to remain quit tepid in the first half of this year   that forecast seem consist with the general lacklust result from nation and region survey of busi activ   still  we don   t see the current situat as precipit a cyclic downturn in aggreg activ   i offer that observ with some trepid   for some reason  i recal past humili more vivid than success  perhap becaus they have occur with much greater frequenc    laughter   but i recal sit here in the autumn of      tell presid pool that we did not see a serious inventori overhang in the tech sector   look back on that episod  it wasn   t that we weren   t look care enough at the data in hand  rather we were led astray by our failur to anticip how rapid final demand for these good would crumbl   if you were inclin to worri on that score  the recent data on final demand might not be encourag  as we have had more surpris to the downsid than the upsid  in that regard  one of the most noteworthi area of downsid surpris has been equip spend   the januari figur on order and shipment for nondefens capit good were weaker than we had expect  and those read came on the heel of consider soft late last year   demand for high technolog good seem to have been well maintain  and although transport invest has been weak  that had larg been expect   the princip surpris has been equip invest outsid high tech and transport  which now seem pois to fall about   percent at an annual rate this quarter after have fallen about   percent in the fourth quarter   both figur well below our earlier expect   to be perfect honest  we   re not entir sure what to make of the magnitud and extent of this soft in capit spend   we don   t think that it is entir a statist mirag becaus we have seen a notic weaken in our industri product measur of busi equip  which for the most part are independ observ   to be sure  much of the slow has occur for equip relat to the motor vehicl and construct industri   but just like the inventori data  the recent inform on capit spend suggest weak beyond these two area   our best guess is that busi may have becom a bit more cautious and possibl scale back or put on hold some capit spend plan while they gaug the extent to which the econom landscap may have shift over the past six month   if so  it may be a while befor those concern fulli abat  accord  we have mark down our forecast for the growth in real e s in       to    percent  from the    percent pace we were project in januari   we do  howev  expect spend growth to pick back up to a rate of about   percent in       onli a bit below our previous forecast   we don   t think a more aggress adjust   such as the one we highlight as the busi pessim scenario in the  book   is yet warrant  financi condit remain favor  corpor balanc sheet general look healthi  capit spend survey have been upbeat  and busi sen ent has soften a bit but not serious sag   we just don   t see the precondit for a serious retrench in capit spend in come quarter   in addit to e s spend  the other major sourc of downward revis in our project was hous   two factor led to the further downward adjust that we made to our hous forecast   first  the actual data on hous start and build permit came in below our expect in januari and suggest to us that the pace of activ in come quarter was like to be more subdu than we had earlier expect   the data that we receiv this morn on start and permit was a mix bag   start of singl famili home rose    percent in februari  in contrast to the   percent increas that we had project   but adjust permit  a less noisi indic of activ  fell   percent last month  close to our expect   taken togeth  the februari read have littl consequ for our project   the second factor weigh on our hous forecast was the rapid intensif of problem in the subprim market   in this project  we made an explicit adjust to our forecast of sale and start for what we now expect to be a signific pullback in nonprim origin in the period ahead   as we note in the  book  we es  that the eas of lend standard may have elev nonprim origin by an amount equal to    percent of total home sale in      and   percent of sale in        we have lower the level of our forecast of start and sale a further   percent to account for a more abrupt pullback in nonprim origin in the month ahead   this would be rough consist with a declin of about    percent in nonprim origin this year   in revis this aspect of our forecast  we have assum that the increas in foreclosur associ with subprim difficulti will have onli a small negat effect on overal hous price   we take some comfort from the fact that futur price on the case shiller hous price index have edg onli slight lower in the past coupl of week as this issu gain attent   we have also assum that there is littl spillov from subprim difficulti into the prime portion of the market   we have for some  e been assum that  as newli issu loan season and as rate reset on adjust rate mortgag  some gradual deterior would occur in loan perform  and that is still our view   in sum  the combin of the weaker incom data and the problem in subprim lend led us to mark down our residenti invest forecast enough to take about   percentag point off the growth of real gdp this year   obvious  this area will requir continu scrutini in the period ahead   elsewher in the household sector  consum spend has been come in veri close to our expect   last week   s retail sale report was read by mani as weak  but it was right in line with our forecast   to be sure  sale increas have trail off in recent month  but that pattern is consist with the mark slow in consumpt growth that we are forecast for the second quarter   although the data have been in line with our expect  the fundament for consum spend have weaken sinc the januari  book   in particular  the trajectori of oil price is about    per barrel abov our previous forecast  and this should take a bite out of purchas power go forward   in addit  we now have equiti price run about   percent below our previous project  which along with slight weaker hous price  suggest a bit less impetus to spend from wealth   all told  real pce is expect to increas at an annual rate of     percent this year and next  down about   percentag point from our previous forecast   this might sound like a pretti gloomi report   but there have been some posit  too     will discuss the extern sector  which is expect to be a smaller drag on output in this forecast compar with our previous one   also  fiscal polici  most notabl defens spend  seem like to impart more impetus to growth than we had earlier expect   moreov  the labor market continu to flash stronger signal than would be expect from an economi in which growth has slow below the pace of it potenti   the unemploy rate fell back to     percent in februari and has been basic trendless sinc last fall   if payrol employ gain have slow at all in recent month  they have slow just a bit  there have been a few develop of late that hint of a slow in labor demand  initi claim have averag a higher level in recent week  and insur unemploy has move up   moreov  job loser unemploy less than five week   a proxi for the layoff rate   have increas  and survey of hire plan have turn a bit less posit   we still think a slowdown in labor demand will becom more evid in the come month  but you   ve heard me say that befor   in the end  there were more minus than pluse over this intermeet period  and we mark down our forecast for the growth of real gdp by   percentag point both this year and next  to     and     percent  respect   but we consid these to be increment adjust to a stori that remain basic unchang   hous is current exert a consider drag on aggreg econom activ   that drag should lessen in the second half of this year  and the pace of expans should pick up somewhat   howev  the reacceler of activ seem like to be limit   the slowdown in hous price impli a diminish impetus from household wealth and the normal multipli acceler consequ of the current hit to home construct should restrain the growth of consumpt and busi invest  with growth project to remain below potenti  the unemploy rate is expect to drift up to     percent by the end of next year  a bit abov our previous project   as for inflat  we have had onli minor chang in our forecast of it key determin   as i note earlier  the path of oil price is up about    per barrel  and this add about   percentag point to overal pce inflat this year  boost our forecast to     percent for      and leav      unchang at about   percent   the indirect effect of higher oil price add a few basi point to our forecast of core pce inflat  but those effect were rough offset by the slight larger gdp gap and the slight higher unemploy rate in this forecast   after the forecast close last week  we receiv the cpi and the ppi for februari   the core cpi increas     percent last month  right in line with our project   howev  a jump in the ppi seri on physician servic suggest that core pce price could be up about     percent in februari  a tenth abov our forecast   if this es  is close to the mark  we will revis up our forecast of core pce inflat in the first quarter to about     percent   we are not inclin  howev  to accord much signal to one month read  and for now  we are stick with our forecast for core pce inflat of    percent this year and   percent in        one reason for keep the inflat forecast unchang despit this news on price is that we have had some low read on labor compens   the eci and averag hour earn have come in below our forecast  after we adjust for the transitori influenc of a jump in bonus and stock option  the growth of nonfarm busi hour compens look to be run below our previous forecast   look at the big pictur  pressur on inflat do not appear to us to be intensifi  but they also don   t seem to be abat much either  for the most part  that is what we had been expect to see at this junctur   i will now turn the floor over to   to sum up develop in the other     economi of the world    laughter
construct our outlook for the rest of the global economi this  e entail assess the inform in and implic of vari indic of activ from differ region  the somewhat weaker prospect for u s  output growth  and the backup in global oil price   in addit  we struggl to understand the like consequ of the episod of financi market volatil that emerg in global equiti and credit market at the end of februari as well as the risk to our forecast that this episod might foreshadow   in the end  our baselin forecast for real gdp growth abroad is just slight stronger over this year and about the same next year as in the januari  book   our project for foreign inflat has been revis up just a littl in respons to the higher level of our path for oil price   the result contribut for u s  real gdp growth this year from the extern sector is about neutral and that for next year is a small negat  we now see export  relat to the januari forecast  as contribut slight more posit to u s  gdp growth over the forecast period and are project an arithmet negat contribut from import that is a bit smaller in magnitud  especi this year   the favor news for activ abroad was most from the major foreign industri countri   we were particular surpris by japanes real gdp growth in the fourth quarter  which in the latest data was an annual rate of     percent    percentag point abov our expect in januari   household consumpt show some sign of strength   a develop that has been lack in japanes econom activ for a long  e   in addit  privat invest spend increas at a doubl digit rate   avail indic for activ in januari  such as machineri order and household expenditur  support the view that solid expans is continu  and we have revis up our near term forecast such that our project growth rate for      is    percentag point stronger   the econom expans in the euro area continu to firm  and we were surpris by the fourth quarter growth rate there  as well   the     percent annual rate of growth record for last quarter was   percentag point higher than we had expect in januari   that strength was due particular to invest and to export demand   we have revis up our outlook for growth over the forecast period about   percentag point as a result   within emerg asia  real gdp continu to expand vigor in china and in india  sustain expans in the region at an averag annual rate of about   percent  we see averag growth in latin america this quarter as have been slow by weak in mexico that is relat to soft in u s  manufactur product  mexican growth should rebound in line with the project improv in u s  industri product  result in averag growth in the region of about     percent over the forecast period   we have revis down slight our forecast for growth in mexico and emerg asia relat to the januari outlook   on balanc  we do not see the negat implic of the slight weaker u s  project this  e as outweigh the indic of robust domest demand in europ and asia   accord  our baselin forecast continu to be for vigor growth on averag abroad   a weaker u s  outcom than project is clear a downsid risk for the global economi  howev   the rise in oil price over the intermeet period eras some of the inflat restraint that the low januari level of global crude price provid   we have ad a coupl of tenth to our inflat project as a result  with most of the upward revis project for the asian emerg market economi that are veri depend on import crude oil   the heighten financi market volatil that appear in late februari was a global event  with stock price in sever major foreign countri declin   to

govern bond move down in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and canada as investor shift to higher qualiti secur   but in mani instanc  these move just brought the particular price or yield back to it level toward the end of last year   although the drop in chines stock price on februari    was seen on that day as a contribut factor  market develop on subsequ day support the view that much of the concern of global investor is direct toward the u s  expans and  in particular  the u s  subprim mortgag market   we do not see the market correct to date as a sourc of signific restraint on spend abroad   in addit  the evid weak in the u s  hous sector has limit potenti for spillov to econom activ abroad  accord  we have strengthen a littl our forecast for foreign real output growth and reduc the magnitud of the net subtract from u s  gdp growth impli by the project for export and import   clear  global financi market particip are readi to react strong to ani news suggest less favor outcom on invest   this pose a negat risk to the global outlook as the financi market respons to a negat shock may intensifi the consequ of that shock for credit extens  spend  and ul  global growth   on the upsid  we have been surpris by the strength of domest demand in some foreign industri countri  and we could be underes  it momentum   in addit  a more buoyant outcom for china is alway a possibl   last week we receiv data on the u s  balanc of payment for the fourth quarter  complet our pictur for the year as whole   although the annual total for the current account deficit rose in       the balanc for the fourth quarter narrow quit a bit   that narrow is due to a reduc trade deficit and a swing to posit in the figur for net invest incom   a decreas in our nomin oil bill larg account for the improv in the trade deficit  but the non oil trade balanc also narrow somewhat   the smaller bill for import oil in the fourth quarter result main from lower price  although the quantiti import declin as well   the balanc on the portfolio portion of u s  net invest incom was a sizabl deficit that widen about    billion at an annual rate from the previous quarter   howev  the posit balanc on direct invest incom jump near     billion at an annual rate as receipt continu to be robust and payment fell sharpli   the declin in payment was widespread across sector and countri   the net result was a posit figur for total invest incom of near     billion   go forward  we expect that the current account deficit will resum widen from it reduc  fourth quarter level and will reach about      billion  or     percent of gdp  by the end of        we project that a widen of the trade deficit will continu  with the oil and the non oil compon of the merchandis balanc both becom larger deficit   howev  a posit chang in the balanc on servic will partial offset the deterior in the deficit on trade good   the net invest incom balanc should account for a larger portion of the current account widen  the posit balanc of direct invest incom should drop back in the near term but then rise slowli to record a small  posit net chang over the forecast period  howev  the negat balanc for portfolio incom is expect to increas in magnitud signific  as our net intern invest posit record yet greater net indebted   this increas net indebted and wider current account deficit will continu as long as the trade deficit remain sizabl     and i will be happi to answer ani question
thank you veri much   are there question  presid pool
dave  i have a question relat to hous   i gather that a good part of the project that the drag from hous will work off by the end of this year come from the belief that sale will gradual clean out the inventori of unsold home and  onc that happen  construct can return to the rate of sale   that   s the unsold inventori of recent built new home that i guess have never been occupi   if you take the hous boom over  say  the three year end in the middl of last year  was there an accumul of hous that ran beyond the under demograph and incom   and the financ cost  too   i   m interest in those longer run determin of the equilibrium stock of hous   did we end up with a stock of hous that outran the under long run determin and has to be work off   in the sens that the under determin have to catch up to the stock that has alreadi been construct
that   s possibl   we have not taken that view   overal hous construct had some unexplain strength over the past year  not from a bottom up demograph addit but just in term of what we would have expect given the growth in employ  incom  and wealth   admit  the evid is still veri tentat  but we think we see some sign of demand stabil around current level so that  in our start forecast  we   ll be abl to drive the month    suppli of home back down relat to the low level that it had actual been run from the mid     s to the middl of the hous boom   so i don   t think we   re see an excess suppli of home that peopl just won   t want at current price  or rough current price  but that is a consider risk   ad up household format and demolit   there   s a lot of uncertainti about that  and there   s a lot of cyclic sensit as well to the overal household format rate   so whether the hous stock outran the long run determin is kind of hard to nail down   we see that as a risk  but it   s not incorpor in this forecast   if that were the case  there could be a bigger drag on hous activ than we   re anticip
recoveri in that sector could take much longer
presid  n
dave  i have a question about the signific downshift in employ that you have start around midyear becaus i notic that output per hour continu to move along quit nice throughout the period through the end of next year   is that just a bet that most of the expans on the suppli side will come from product  or is someth els go on there
it   s a combin of two bet that are probabl both riski   one is that in fact product will continu and that what we   ve seen more recent is a littl more pronounc cyclic sag in product growth and not a sign that under structur product is weaker than we   re es    the second bet is that  on the suppli side  the growth in the labor forc will be relat weak   therefor  we will not need to have as much employ growth
the unemploy rate   go up
those are two element of the forecast that we   re struggl with  over the past few month there has been a littl evid perhap that the particip rate has been a bit higher than our model was forecast   that might suggest some upsid risk on the labor forc growth   on the other hand  the product figur have probabl been run below what our model would have expect  given our es  of structur product
just for clarif     from peak to trough in term of hous start  what percent chang in construct do you forecast
we   re think of a declin someth like    or    percent at this point
so     million  is that right
in our forecast  we   re not too far from the bottom   we made the bottom a littl deeper this  e and put it off just a littl bit longer   i said befor that we saw sign that demand was stabil   in some sens  the adjust that we   ve made for these recent subprim develop suggest to us that there will be anoth small step down in demand go forward from where we current are   that make the process of work off the inventori  to which presid pool point  a littl more prolong   it also put this hous downturn  in term of magnitud  veri close to the one that occur in the earli     s
are there other question   if not  we are readi for the econom go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   recent data on econom activ have been downbeat in mani sector  and i agre with the general tenor of the  book that the near term outlook is weaker than befor   inde  we have cut expect growth this year almost    percentag point  to    percent   this pace of growth is substanti below potenti  and we expect the unemploy rate to start to edg up fair quick   even relat to this lower baselin  i think the downsid risk to the prospect for output growth have sharpen in the intermeet period   i   m especi concern about two risk   broader retrench in financi market along the line that we   re see in the subprim mortgag market and a further hesit and falter of capit spend  as we discuss in detail two year ago  an asset price bubbl inevit lead to unsustain imbal in the economi and a misalloc of resourc   the extraordinari run up in hous price in recent year led to construct and sale boom that couldn   t last   so far the adjust to more sustain level of hous start and sale have been relat order   howev  there is still an overhang of precari financ from the past relax mortgag lend standard that has to be elimin   for exampl  in      and      someth like    percent of first  e homebuy put no money down with their purchas   the market is begin to recogn the size of this overhang and  with the recent deterior in the perform of subprim mortgag  is dramat reassess mortgag risk   go forward  we will have to close monitor increas in mortgag risk compens and tighten of credit standard   such chang  especi if they go too fast or too far  could amplifi the hous sector declin as has been recogn  push hous price and activ down  and with spillov to consum spend  they could prove to be a substanti drag on the overal economi  despit the recent turmoil in equiti and mortgag market  a reassess of overal risk has yet to occur   we are still in an environ of low long term yield  ampl liquid  and what appear to be a general low level of compens for risk   for exampl  i recent talk with the princip of sever major privat equiti fund  who were not just amaz but also appal about the amount of money their industri has attract    laughter   one partner said that he would have no difficulti immedi rais    billion   inde  one of his biggest problem is would be investor who get angri at him becaus he is unwil to take their money   this unwilling reflect his difficulti in identifi deal that are like to yield adequ return even though  for the buyout firm  debt also is avail in what they depict as veri attract so call coven lite term   perhap too attract given the vulner of some of the high leverag yield   my contact suggest that some privat equiti firm with similar assess of the shortag of profit opportun are less restrain and do take addit money  part becaus of the larg upfront fee that are generat by these deal   so just as we have seen in mortgag market  the bubbl in privat equiti  as my sourc character it  and the overabund of liquid more general rais the risk of a sharp retrench in credit and higher risk spread with associ risk to econom growth and  conceiv  even financi stabil  a second  relat risk concern invest spend   it   s surpris that  despit the ampl financ avail  firm have still been reluct to ramp up their capit spend  certain  ani precipit tighten of financ could curtail invest   howev  as note in one of the  book altern simul  greater busi pessim about futur return to new capit is also a signific risk   the recent pullback in order and shipment for capit good has persist and deepen more than ani of us had anticip   even for high tech spend  which continu to expand  my contact on the manufactur side are not veri op ist   sale of pcs and relat equip were mild disappoint in       and our contact don   t see the introduct of the microsoft vista oper system in januari as have generat much enthusiasm among busi  turn to inflat  our outlook for core inflat  like that of the  book  has chang littl sinc januari   i continu to anticip gradual moder inflat with core pce price inflat edg down from    percent in      to   percent this year   there are certain clear upsid risk to this forecast  especi given the resumpt of increas in energi price   these risk remain despit some weaken in the outlook for real activ   in principl  the anticip subpar growth should help reliev inflationari pressur   howev  we remain veri uncertain about what par is   the continu low unemploy rate  coupl with recent sluggish output growth  suggest via     s law that potenti output could be grow in the vicin of    percent   if  contrari to our assumpt  that were the case  ani labor market tight now boost inflat might not diminish this year  more favor news is found in recent survey evid on inflat expect   as mani of you have comment in past meet  inflat expect are perhap more influenti to the inflat outlook than is the unemploy rate   their relat stabil over the past sever year has probabl been a key factor restrain the rise in inflat over the past two year   howev  what has not general been note is the import of near term inflat expect  those with a forecast horizon of a year or two   both econom theori and empir evid suggest that these near term inflat expect are as import as long run expect for determin inflat dynam   the latest blue chip and profession forecast survey both show expect of core inflat edg down next year   for exampl  the spf show core pce inflat drop to   percent next year  exact in line with our own forecast   i also see the general downward tilt in inflat expect over the next coupl of year as contribut to a favor inflat prognosi
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the seventh district are similar to what i report last  e   busi activ continu to expand at a modest pace  howev  while my contact express some increas uncertainti  most of them maintain a posit view about the outlook for the second half of the year   as we know  the two sector that generat the most uncertainti this round are hous and busi invest  and so i want to concentr some of my comment on those two area  on the hous front  my contact continu to be unsur about how soon the turnaround will be   a director from pult home saw hint of a better tone in the market but acknowledg that sign were still tentat   he did say that the larger builder have reduc their stock of specul home   anoth director  who is ceo of u s  gypsum  thought it would be a coupl of month befor he had a better idea whether the market had hit bottom   furthermor  he thought that  even after the market hit bottom  it would be quit a while befor build materi recov to normal sale level   as we were discuss  the subprim situat could be a serious problem for the macroeconomi in a coupl of way   one would be a major spillov to hous price   it   s too soon to tell about this now  but new spring list should shed some light by our next meet   the other would be signific fallout to other credit market segment  and we don   t see this yet either   i contact both gm and ford  and they said that the subprim mortgag held by their credit subsidiari had deterior  but they had not seen increas default in other portion of their portfolio   notabl  they had not seen ani unusu problem in auto loan  and we general heard this sen ent of a lack of spillov from banker as well   on the suppli side  given the ampl liquid in financi market  it seem unlik that the subprim problem will caus major chang in overal credit avail or price  turn to busi invest  none of my contact report ani major chang in capit spend plan one way or the other   that said  i did sens that busi had becom a bit more cautious  as   mention   a ceo of a major bank thought that some of this caution was due to the news in the subprim market  but he didn   t think that this was imping on spend in a meaning way   as note by the head of a major privat equiti firm  who is on our board  the recent volatil in financi market has not signific alter the avail or term for financ  even for riskier project   privat equiti firm continu to rais larg sum  as   discuss   so although i   m more concern about the outlook  i don   t see the forc in play that would generat a major retrench in capit spend   inventori are anoth factor that has weigh on growth recent   we   ve heard mix report from district contact about how far along they are in the inventori adjust process   in steel  the process seem to be take longer than expect  but in motor vehicl  both gm and ford now are general comfort with their inventori posit and current are not plan ani major chang in their assembl schedul   final  some sector of the economi appear to be on good foot   healthi labor market continu to support solid gain in consum spend  and as   discuss  growth abroad continu to support export demand  after balanc all the factor  we mark down our near term forecast for gdp a bit but retain the basic contour of our previous project   the most import differ between our forecast and the  book is that we do not see as much short term weak  but the uncertainti surround this forecast has increas   by itself  the chang to the growth outlook this round would suggest slight less inflat risk  but other factor point to continu concern about inflat   the past coupl of read on consum price have been disappoint   oil price are higher than at our last meet  and unit labor cost acceler notic over the past year   furthermor  labor market remain tight   so while the benefit of some factor  notabl the earlier declin in energi cost  will be transitori  pressur from high labor cost are like to persist   markup remain high enough to absorb some cost increas  but these margin could evapor quick  as they did in the late      s  in the end  we did not materi chang our outlook for inflat   we continu to project that core pce price will increas about    percent both this year and next   this inflat rate is too high for my tast  and i think for mani of us  and i   m not confid that inflat will moder adequ as we move into        one reason for my concern is highlight in the bluebook   name  that the privat sector seem to be bet that our inflat object is   percent or higher   so i continu to think that over the forecast period as a whole the risk to price stabil exceed the risk to sustain growth
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom pictur in our region has chang littl sinc our last meet   it seem as though i   ve use that phrase almost everi meet for the past three meet   econom activ is expand at a moder pace in our district   busi contact expect that pace to continu in the come month   accord to our march survey  manufactur activ in our region remain flat  and we   ve seen littl chang in this activ in the last six month   the general activ index actual fell from     in februari to     in march  which are both essenti the same and veri close to zero   but there were some posit to be read from the survey   first  both the new order and shipment index improv this month   second  the diffus index of capit expenditur  which reflect firm    plan spend six month from now  move up to    percent   a level that is consider abov the averag level of    seen over the past two expans   third  other index of futur activ remain relat strong   final  in respons to a special survey question and ignor mere season chang in activ  twice as mani of our firm said that they expect their own product to acceler rather than to deceler in the second quarter compar with the first quarter      percent  compar with    percent   i take these as sign that our manufactur see the soft patch as temporari rather than more prolong  and this is consist with the anecdot evid gather in talk to the busi contact in our region   thus  busi sen ent among our manufactur firm appear to have chang littl sinc our last meet  there has been littl chang not onli in overal activ but also in the pattern across sector   hous continu to weaken   area homebuild that we survey in februari indic that sale continu to declin  and high inventori continu to hold back construct activ   nonresidenti real estat market in the region remain firm  but construct has not gain ani appreci strength   one of my contact in a major bank see continu strong loan demand  howev   busi that come to him for loan have strong balanc sheet  their profit remain good  and from his perspect that is support of continu busi invest go forward   this may be suggest that busi invest  which   as mani of us have been concern about   has been weak in the past sever month  may be on the verg of rebound   labor market in the region remain tight   employ in my three state has grown at a pace of     percent over the past three month end in januari  an acceler from the     percent pace over the past twelv month   the unemploy rate has held steadi  and employ continu to complain of difficulti find both skill and unskil labor  on the inflat front  price for industri good continu to move up  but retail price increas have not been widespread   howev  there are sign of increas pressur on wage and salari   wage in low skill job in new jersey and pennsylvania have certain increas becaus of increas in state minimum wage  yet the acceler in wage appear to be more widespread   employ in a number of industri have said they had to rais salari much more this year than they did last year in order to hire and retain worker in certain profession and manageri occup as well as high skill worker in a varieti of job  in summari  busi activ in the region continu to advanc at a moder pace   i   m look for other word to substitut for    moder     which get old after a while   our busi contact expect this moder pace to be maintain in come month  turn to the nation economi  at the  e of our last meet  the data on real activ had come in stronger than expect  and inflat  while still elev  had move down a bit  sinc then  the data suggest perhap a somewhat weaker near term growth outlook and a backslid in my view in the progress on inflat   if these recent data are indic of the futur  then we are in a much less comfort posit than we thought we were a few week ago   i think there is still good reason to believ that the weak we are see on the real side of the economi remain confin to the effect of the hous correct and to a lesser extent of the auto correct  which should moder over the year  and that the fundament under the economi remain somewhat strong   i think that labor market will be consider firmer than in the  book forecast and that the consum sector will also hold up in part becaus of that  it   s particular difficult to infer trend from the data from this past januari and februari   a sizabl swing in temperatur from one of the warmest januari on record to one of the coldest februari has led to larg swing in both season factor and the econom data more broad   so i think that we need to be a littl more cautious than usual in tri to interpret these volatil month to month number   that said  i must admit that the uncertainti surround my own forecast that growth will soon return to trend has increas sinc our last meet   the recent declin in new order over the past sever month suggest that the weak we   ve seen in busi invest in the fourth quarter may linger a littl longer than expect  despit healthi busi balanc sheet and posit invest and busi sen ent   although in my view the reassess of risk in the subprim mortgag market suggest that this market is work as it should  the overal weaken in credit condit in the mortgag market increas uncertainti as to whether the hous correct will be contain or whether it will spill over into other sector of the economi   thus  although i   m not realli readi to abandon my forecast  i do think my uncertainti of that forecast has increas somewhat  at the same  e  i   m less convinc that inflat is moder and that we   re make suffici progress toward price stabil   perhap i realli should say that i am more concern that we are not   the twelv month chang in the core cpi was     percent  and the three month chang has reacceler   i find the upward trend in core inflat over the past year  from   to    percent  troubl   i take some comfort in the fact that inflat expect have move down somewhat   even ten year expect inflat in our first quarter survey of profession forecast move down to      percent from     percent   that   s a seismic event   laughter  given the stabil of that number over the past eight year   howev  these expect continu to lag  not lead  inflat   so i remain concern with the inflat number that we are in fact see   thus  i find myself back to where i was this fall   a slowdown in real econom activ  if sustain  would suggest a lower equilibrium real rate  but inflat remain elev  at this point  i would allow for some implicit polici firm impli by a constant fed fund rate unless we see stronger evid of a declin economi   thank you

mr  chairman  i   ll spend a littl  e on the district   i think you can describ it as almost robust  recogn that we are a district that export a lot of raw materi and byproduct of raw materi   we have had solid job gain led by further tighten in our labor market  and recent revis suggest that      job growth was stronger than we had previous thought   mine led the job growth  but we also saw strong gain in profession and busi servic and in leisur and hospit   in fact  our ski season this year was a record  as the snow was also a record   besid shortag of skill labor  of which we are constant get report  we are see also shortag of some lower skill worker as well   in the temporari employ area  for exampl  it is also noteworthi that our manufactur activ has been strengthen   we have receiv good report from our director and advisori council member that it actual strengthen in februari   lower inventori of finish good led to a surg in order backlog  and most industri report robust activ led by machineri and high tech equip product   in addit  plant manag express greater op  about the outlook for employ and capit spend as they look forward  not as they   re look right now  turn to real estat  hous activ may have stabil   we have suffer like the rest of the countri in that area  especi in our denver market  where we have had record level of foreclosur   but beyond that   and even there   we have seen some stabil in our hous market  and our commerci activ remain realli quit solid   hous permit and the valu of new residenti construct held steadi in februari   in addit  the buildup of home inventori has actual slow  and district contact expect inventori to declin gradual in the come month  as they are now see thing turn   nonresidenti construct remain strong  with absorpt of offic space increas in most citi and vacanc rate continu to declin throughout our region   commerci real estat contact expect more new construct in the month ahead   they are actual see it come on the draw board   they also report that offic price and rent increas further  even though sale were somewhat flat over the last month or so  farm financi condit have improv overal  with increas crop price that are be driven by the expand ethanol product   usda forecast that net farm incom will rise about    percent this year   strong incom prospect have boost land price   signific  i might add  in some part   and solidifi farm balanc sheet   one piec of inform i would note is that ethanol is a boom industri right now in the region   not in just our region but in the area around nebraska and iowa   in that area      plant are produc  there are    on the draw board  but we are see some back away from that   three project have been pull back in oklahoma recent  and one more in kansa   but still  a lot are go forward  and it give me some paus becaus it has the tone of too much  too quick  and the real economi will suffer if it back away from that develop   anyway  on balanc  the region economi is veri strong right now  turn to the nation outlook  i would say that  on balanc  although i have revis my outlook down somewhat in       i still have it project as grow on the whole for the year better than     percent   so my outlook is more op ist than that of the  book   there are some reason for that  at least that we   re think through   like other  we see hous stabil  perhap take a littl longer to come back  but inventori seem to have stabil  as those inventori are work off through the first half of this year  we think hous should improv through the rest of the year  at least given where the fix interest rate lie   we   re also see that the secondari effect of the slow of the hous market seem contain at the moment  so that slow is not spill over  and the contain is be strengthen by the fact that person incom are actual continu to improv and that we have a good labor market   so those factor are import   also  as we discuss earlier  foreign demand is strong  and the outlook seem to be good   final  feder spend   the fact is that we   re fight a war  and you tend to spend more over the cours of a war   is pick up i think   coffer are strong  and state are spend at a fair rapid rate   so a lot of factor are affect demand  and therefor i think that this economi will pick up as the year goe on  i recogn veri clear that there are some risk to keep in mind   one is that the hous market could worsen  and there could be further spillov   i   m veri mind of that   but on the other side  i do share some of the concern rais by other in term of the inflat outlook  inflat has not come down as much as we had hope  although i   m still project that it will so long as we keep the rate at their current level   but there are some upsid risk with the tighter labor market and strong demand  and we could see energi price put more pressur on it   so it   s a mix bag perhap with  on balanc  some upsid risk as well as downsid risk to this economi   thank you
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i was remind the other day that the origin stori of goldilock was not quit as we later came to learn it   the first version that was draft was actual call silver hair   when the three bear came back to the hous  the elder ladi  not the littl girl  jump out the window   that was the begin of the goldilock stori  which was later adapt to a more palat commerci stori    laughter   i   m not readi to jump out the window yet  but i do have some concern  and i   d like to talk about three area   the intern side  where the porridg seem to be hot  the domest economi  where it seem to be cool  and in my district  where it seem to be just about right  so  first  on the intern side  just to complement some of     s point  our research and anecdot find show that global capac util has move to the higher end of it rang   world unemploy rate have been fall   capac expans seem to be underpac  even though there is some structur chang in util  and it seem insuffici to meet demand or quell inflat   price for import u s  good have clear move away from deflationari trend to neutral or slight inflationari  as i report befor   and  by the way  across near all product categori   the grow tight in the market for skill foreign labor may be the contribut factor   a veri larg foreign retail oper in china report that they are see wage price inflat for the first  e in the store that they are open and oper   as one of the high tech ceo mention to me earlier  even the indian that they now import  not by bring them physic across but by fiber optic cabl  are be price much more expens   if you add turnov  these worker have becom increas expens   we see pressur from the shipper  note that there are continu upward pressur on fleet util  spot price  and port congest   airlin are report stronger intern load and price traction than in the unit state   express shipper and logist compani are report doubl digit growth in the year to date in europ and still higher rate of growth in asia   so  on balanc  our view from the dalla fed from the intern perspect is that intern data and anecdot evid point to some excess demand outsid the unit state with concomit increas in price pressur  turn to the domest scene  we appear to be sail between the charybdi of a slowdown in the economi and the scylla of higher inflat   i want to talk about both   we   re both measur and hear of greater fragil in the domest economi relat to econom growth and the kind of excess that is lead to the financi turbul that   spoke about  i   ll turn to that in a second   also  we   re not encourag  despit our wish think  on the inflationari front   let me just give you some point other than those that have alreadi been mention  particular other than capit spend  which we see slow across the nation  express shipper  logist compani  report     percent growth year over year for domest ground oper and weaker than expect overal growth  between   and     percent on balanc in the year to date   substanti less than they expect   rail car load are flat to down  reflect the declin in demand for materi for hous and a declin in durabl good order   truck tonnag is off  and order for replac of fleet seem to be reflect more than the effect of these new engin regul that are go into place   i   ll give you one data point mention    bilt   s order book is one third of what it was last year   airlin report weaker domest book and slacken demand relat to last year   with regard to the retail  i have been urg to be cautious in analyz the data  first becaus last year was in essenc a fifti three week year becaus of the late holiday or a thirteen month year due to gift card   our contact report continu strength for high end retail    to   percent unit growth in the first quarter for middl retail like kohl   s and jcpenney  and signific lower growth rate with compani like wal mart pray that the advanc of daylight save  e will lift them from flat growth to   to   percent comp   final  restaur report continu movement down the food chain   no pun intend    laughter  from the middl incom eateri to the mcdonald   s of the world   if you notic mcdonald   s report  they are quit stout  wherea the middl incom eateri are suffer   in short  we expect slower top line growth across the board  i want to talk for a minut about hous   one of my contact at wal mart mention that  when they recent survey their custom  concern about hous did not even rank in the top ten of consum    concern   despit that  a larg housebuild  whom i mention in previous convers around this tabl  say that they have gone from monsoon to scatter thunderstorm  and anoth report a declin in the need to grant concess   yet both are concern about subprim and alt a    infect     as one call it   go back to our previous convers  one of the builder  whose averag home price exceed           has through thorough analysi just discov that    percent of last year   s build were financ by alt a mortgag   if you look at the secur analysi for that particular compani  the best guess  is    percent   so  be from the clinton administr  i   m a bit worri  i   m get to the point where    don   t ask  don   t tell    may be the best approach to interview some of these homebuild   clear  they are concern   they have an overstock of inventori  and they   re begin to cut back signific on activ   if you rememb     origin i did talk about a    percent peak to trough correct when you were not quit at that number   now i   ve caught up with you   i   m at    percent at a minimum and quit concern about it  i   m also concern about what presid   refer to as a possibl for a retrench in the credit market   i point  as other have done  to the signific oversuppli of privat equiti capit   to give you a specif exampl  in the case of texa util  between a friday and a wednesday  the two princip investor line up      billion apiec  anoth billion from five other equiti investor  and in the end over     billion of commit capit from the bank in a two day lineup period  onli half of which was use   so  mr  chairman  in short  in the domest economi  i   m concern that the tail in term of a recess has not becom slimmer as i mention last  e   i would redact those word   i believ it has becom fatter  and i believ that financi market turbul has a potenti to becom greater  as to the scylla of inflat  i keep tell myself     that with the passag of  e we   ll see improv  that one month   s set of number such as we had in decemb   not a trend make   i tell myself that two month    number  like those we saw in decemb and januari  do not a trend make   but the number are less than comfort   on a six month basi through januari  both our trim mean at the dalla feder reserv bank and your pce exclud food and energi are stuck at     percent   on a twelv month basi  the trim mean was stuck at     percent  and your pce exclud food and energi was     percent   the recent cpi report was hard encourag   sixti eight percent of the compon rose   percent or more   to be sure  there are tamer oer read  but they   re be offset by a pickup in core good inflat   i continu to worri about the polit effect of this kind of inflationari run   i note ye day   s headlin in the christian scienc monitor state that    inflat is eat up u s  wage gain     on the region side  what i   ve report abov is reflect to some extent in the eleventh district   growth has slow  but hous price are stabl  and hous inventori are thus far healthi   yet we continu to experi signific wage price pressur   our dynam are much stronger than those of the rest of the nation   one of the credit card compani report that sale use their card in our region were up      percent year over year through februari  versus   to   percent on the ea n and we n seaboard  in short  mr  chairman  i see geograph dispers in the growth pattern   strong growth oversea  relat strong growth in our district  and a develop worrisom growth scenario for the rest of the unit state   we see less abat of inflat than we had hope for   with regard to prepar for tomorrow   s discuss about what to do about it  i find myself on the horn of a dilemma   i would say that the risk are more even balanc  and yet the tail of less growth and the risk of recess and the other tail of aw stubborn inflat have fatten and not trim   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   overal  econom activ in the fifth district expand modest in recent week  though perform across sector remain uneven  growth is center in the servic sector  where moder posit read continu   real activ has recov somewhat in recent week  and big ticket sale have post modest gain after two month of quit weak read   in manufactur  our survey respond continu to report a downward drift in activ   they remain op ist about their futur prospect  howev  though mani comment on general weak current demand   labor market remain tight in most jurisdict  with the standard report of spot shortag of skill worker  but wage pressur are report to be moder   we continu to hear of some reason firm hous activ in a number of district local   home price remain general flat  though builder are offer more incent to buyer   inflat pressur appear to have moder in march accord to our latest survey  but manufactur and servic provid expect price pressur to increas modest over the next six month  on the nation level  risk seem to have risen late  but my sens is that prospect are still reason sound   subprim mortgag  obvious  have domin the financi news in recent week   concern about the welfar of famili suffer foreclosur are quit natur  and anecdot about outright fraud suggest some crimin   but my overal sens of what   s go on is that an industri of origin and investor simpli misjudg subprim mortgag default frequenc   realiz of that risk seem to be play out in a fair order way so far  mortgag back secur have lost valu as risk spread have widen  and there have been insolv among firm that special in this sector   the updat of risk es  in light of recent experi will lead to higher borrow cost in the affect market segment  and at the margin this increas could shift some household from homeownership to rent   but in my judgment  that isn   t like to affect the net demand for hous unit   notabl  we have not seen broader risk to credit avail in other market or to the financi safeti net   perhap the greatest econom risk pose by recent subprim develop is legisl that imped the avail of credit or that provid financi support ex post that was unanticip ex ant but affect privat decisionmak henceforth  somewhat like ad hoc disast relief  hous construct continu to contract  of cours  and inventori remain elev  the choppi winter data make it hard to gaug the descent  but overal home sale seem to be hold steadi  and we haven   t heard anyth local that suggest a renew contract in demand   so the hous outlook hasn   t chang much for me   howev  the recent weak in busi invest has been disappoint   one would expect soft patch relat to hous  auto  and the new truck regul  but the broader sluggish is a bit at odd with the general favor fundament   i still expect this invest to pick up ul   although i have to admit that the recent data have left me a bit less certain  especi about when   the outlook for consum spend remain fair healthi  though   real dispos incom growth has been power by continu gain in employ and firmer wage growth   so all in all  i still think the current episod of below trend growth is fundament a transitori phenomenon that will most like be behind us by the end of the year  although the recent weak in busi invest suggest more downsid risk than befor  core inflat continu to firm  and it now seem clear that the fourth quarter   s energi induc lull is over   we have yet to see much sign of the long await eas in resourc util   it   s not obvious that we will be get ani help from labor cost ani  e soon  and inflat expect remain center at or abov   percent   so to me  the prospect for moder in inflat remain tenuous   i continu to believ that  by summer  growth concern are like to be behind us  and we will want to act to reduc inflat  which we recogn is higher than we want   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   comment from my busi contact confirm the soften in econom activ that is depict in the  book   most of the peopl i talk with dure this intermeet period confirm the slow that we are see in the nation data   but at the same  e  they expect that busi will improv over this year   my busi contact are still plan to add modest to staff and to expand output  although their capit spend plan are not particular ambiti this year   a number of my busi contact told me that the dollar depreci is final have an effect   they are get more order and are be ask to quot more job from foreign custom  i have recent had convers with ceo of the larg bank from my district  who have an interest perspect on the ongo turmoil in the subprim mortgag market   they don   t seem to be particular concern that the situat in the mortgag market is go to be substanti wors than is alreadi factor into the admit weak hous forecast   but they are concern  as presid   mention in her comment earlier  that the subprim mortgag problem are symptomat of broader issu that could spill over into hedg fund and privat equiti fund   both of which have becom an increas import sourc of fund for busi invest activ   they worri that retrench among manag of these fund could advers affect busi confid more general   their comment resembl the altern  book scenario label    busi pessim with spillov      the differ  howev  is that my busi contact are suggest that the problem could origin in the financi sector and spill over to produc    expect  turn to inflat  the volatil in the month retail price number  even in the so call core measur  will make it difficult to clear perceiv the veri modest progress in the inflat trend that appear in the  book baselin   given the usual nois in the price data  work by my research depart indic that identifi a break in the inflat trend on the order of about    percentag point with a fair amount of certainti can take somewher between a year and a half and two year after the break has in fact occur   while i believ we are still on a cours that lead to a lower inflat trend  the path we take to get there will not like be a smooth one  and there will be  e that will test our nerv   inde  as i look at the data today  i would judg that the downsid risk to the real economi has increas somewhat   still  in my view the primari risk we face is that inflat could remain stuck higher than either i or the  book forese   under these condit  i think two qualiti are essenti   patienc and clariti   we need to be patient so that we don   t becom unnecessarili aggress in tri to fo  lower inflat in a soften econom environ  and we need clariti so that the public   not come to see our patienc as indiffer to the current inflat trend   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   perhap unlik in the rest of the countri  most of the recent cyclic data point to some reason for op  about near term growth in new england  with the possibl except of the rate of foreclosur initi relat to subprim mortgag   the annual benchmark revis by the bls paint a happier pictur of the current state of region job growth  especi in massachusett and connecticut   the overal messag is that the region has been grow at a pace that is about at it long term trend and has been ad job consist in recent month   this pictur is a bit differ from the one we   ve been see for some  e  the region   s unemploy rate remain about at the nation   s  and demand for skill labor  as measur by both onlin and newspap help want ad and by anecdot report  is quit strong   inde  mani continu to note that hire the skill worker they need has been difficult   both temporari help servic firm and softwar and it firm report strong demand for labor  particular to meet financ and technic posit and to meet a grow backlog in activ in high tech busi   this aspect of the region   s labor market may be pull some discourag worker back into the labor forc  as reflect in the perhap temporari uptick in unemploy   reflect this better news on region job growth  the philadelphia fed   s coincid econom index point to econom activ in the region   s two largest state that is on a par with nation growth   when we survey a wide swath of retail contact  we saw a bit of gloom on the retail side   but the fact that in new england you have an array of veri small compani  some  in uniqu circumst  may have given a littl downbeat sens to the retail climat   the report from larger retail in the survey   and we have a coupl of them   show solid year over year growth   manufactur employ continu to declin  but manufactur export last quarter rose at a pace just a bit slower than the nation   s and were buoy by airlin relat product  fabric metal  and general machineri   as i   ve note befor  downtown vacanc rate in most of the citi in new england are declin  as are suburban offic vacanc  rent are rise  and one or two corridor fan out from boston are report hot site for new biotech firm locat   busi confid  as measur by local survey  is up  as is consum confid   so  overal  thing are not too bad  a concern among this most brighter news is the rise rate of initi of real estat foreclosur  especi those relat to properti financ with subprim adjust rate mortgag   accord to data from the mortgag banker associ  whether one look at the rate of total foreclosur or at the pace of foreclosur among just subprim mortgag  initi have risen rapid in new england from a veri low base and now outstrip the nation   s   this is not a contest you want to win   anecdot abound about individu borrow lure into what appear to be quit inappropri mortgag  and the feder reserv bank of boston has been work with local banker    associ and the massachusett bank depart and other on outreach and educ   whi new england general  and massachusett specif  should be outstrip the nation in this area isn   t realli clear   the local bank industri   not appear to have play much of a role in subprim lend  nor were we an area of bubbl like real estat growth  though clear price rose rapid in the region over a fair long  e   the detriment effect to local communiti from the rise in foreclosur and the potenti for negat polit fallout   not unlik what presid   mention   seem obvious  on the nation scene  the incom data on the real economi  with the possibl except of job growth  have been slower than i expect   inflat data  if anyth  have been higher   the pictur is not comfort  and it is complic by question relat both to the hous market and the surpris slow pace of busi spend   mani peopl around the tabl have mention both those thing   the degre of nation fallout from problem in subprim mortgag lend is a question right now  as it bear both on the pace of recoveri in residenti real estat invest and on the potenti for wider spillov from hous to consumpt   at present  we in boston  like the  book author  don   t expect that subprim mortgag problem will by themselv have much of an effect on overal growth   but we do have a concern if these problem lead to tighter lend standard  make mortgag and other borrow more difficult to obtain and therebi exacerb hous inventori overhang  extend the current period of sluggish new home start  and creat further downward pressur on home price   so far  we don   t see much of that happen   trend in overal market and bank liquid  mortgag interest rate  and new mortgag issuanc are all posit   we think that those trend  combin with posit consum home buy attitud  paint a reassur pictur that some of the downward trend will not be as sever as they otherwis might be   inde  i spoke to member of the advisori board of harvard   s joint center for hous studi in late februari   the group was compos of about fifti major homebuild and major supplier to the build industri   they were in a bit of collect shock regard the rapid deterior that they saw in their industri from late last year into the current quarter and seem to be focus on inventori and cost control rather than on profit this year  which they didn   t expect  howev  they saw continu spend on home improv  growth from commerci construct  and strength in non u s  market as partial offset   no one in the group mention the subprim issu or potenti problem in mortgag financ  but that may have just been the fact of the moment   it was actual the day befor the market break in late februari  so it   s possibl that they are not think along the same line today  we have also been ask ourselv whi busi fix invest has been so slow relat to fundament   we had been assum that this inexplic trend would right itself and that growth of produc    durabl equip would show greater sign of health  but that hasn   t happen   we  like the  book  have written down expect regard pde   i   d realli like to be wrong on the downsid regard this area  as it worri me a bit more than subprim mortgag or ani of the recent financi market up and down   if busi lack the confid to invest in new equip as much as they might be expect to given the fundament  how much longer will they continu to hire staff   if job growth slow  what will happen to consumpt   to date  both hire and consumpt remain pretti solid   but while i saw some upsid risk here at our last meet  now i   m a littl worri on the downsid   in view of the incom data  we have written down our forecast  much as the  book has  and we have join the  book in a lower es  of potenti   we see growth a bit abov   percent this year  rise to the mid  s in        with slight rise unemploy and onli slight slow core pce inflat  howev  as i probabl impli befor  i think the risk around this forecast on both side seem to have risen   will hous trend and the possibl effect of diminish busi spend affect the resili consum more than we now expect   will the under pattern of core inflat continu to surpris on the upsid  with the moder we expect remain most in the forecast   i don   t mean to overreact here   there are posit   extern growth is strong  fiscal spend at both the state and the nation level should be support   financi market  though certain a bit more volatil and nervous  remain accommod   perhap the downsid risk to growth that i see are simpli the ebb and flow of the u s  economi continu it transit from an abov trend rate of expans just a year ago  not unlik the slow patch we saw in the late summer and earli fall of last year   all in all  i remain somewhat more concern about risk on the inflat side than about risk to growth   but it   seem to me as though the balanc act in meet our two object has gotten a bit more difficult
thank you   presid    could you just say a word about your outreach on the mortgag problem
we have done quit a bit of work with the bank depart of the state of massachusett and with the massachusett banker associ   we have had meet with those two group in mani of the affect area around massachusett  basic look to provid educ   we   ve done some materi on the educ side   obvious  onc you   re in the midst of a foreclosur  educ isn   t all that help   the bank depart has been tri to bring along local lender to see what they can do to creat a refinanc situat for borrow   we   re not part of that particular convers  but we have been part of the outreach that the bank depart has been make
well  we here in washington expect to have to answer a few question about the subprim situat  and we would be veri interest in anyon   s experi   if ani other reserv bank is involv or has ani plan  we   d be interest to hear about them

thank you  mr  chairman   as other have comment  the latest number on the perform of the nation economi have been mix  which is to say less posit than i had expect  and i take the  book   s point that growth is subdu this quarter   i don   t view the recent news on inflat as especi favor  but i don   t find it over alarm either   the question for me is  do the latest read have implic for econom perform beyond the current quarter   that is  say  over the next sever quarter or so   at this stage  my answer to that question is    no     in part becaus i want to avoid get whipsaw by mark down the forecast now onli to mark it back up in may or june   more fundament  i think that continu gain in employ and incom  sound fundament for busi invest  sustain increas in govern spend  and general liquid financi condit are like to maintain the expans  i also think that the trade situat may turn out to be a bit better than that depict in the  book  assum that energi price don   t take off a lot from here   i also take some comfort that  at least until now  i haven   t view my forecast as especi ebulli   by the way  i do think that the hous correct still has some way to run  as i   ve comment befor  larg becaus of the overhang of unsold properti  to get some addit evid on the latest develop  we call a number of our contact in retail late last week to see if we could detect anyth new in consum spend  the short answer i would say is    no      a clear trend was not appar from our contact   some report signific increas in sale recent and were op ist about prospect   some experienc sale decreas and were at the least cautious  and some said sale were unfold more or less as anticip   overal  this is probabl modest good news  sinc at least there was no obvious break in consum outlay   as for inflat  i would judg that the situat has not chang appreci  and so i continu to expect modest deceler over  e   i don   t sens that price pressur are build at this point  but you have to look pretti hard to find convinc sign of moder as well   thank you
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   regard the small hand of contact with whom i   ve talk  my truck industri contact find thing slight better in februari and march  but thing had been veri  veri slow befor that   the compani has reduc it truck fleet by      my contact say that price is flat for the first  e in six year  there is a tremend amount of price competit   he say that he   s get four  e the usual number of bid   so the custom are shop around hard look for price concess   he said thing were just margin better  both the up and fedex contact had a similar messag   that activ is come in substanti below what they had anticip   the overnight letter busi is declin   it is down about   percent  the next day packag busi is up about   percent   those are the express product  the net of those is about zero or mayb   percent  and they had been expect someth on the order of   percent   so they   re revis down their expect for this year but appar not chang their under capit invest plan   howev  my up contact  in particular  said that they are realli scrambl now to reduc outlay   essenti  their commit for expens are pretti well set in the short run  and so revenu shortfal go direct to the bottom line  therefor they are scratch around to reduc expens   they are not replac staff when there   s attrit  and they are cut out unnecessari travel   all the usual kind of thing   they have reduc staff  focus particular on manag posit  which they have reduc by        i   ve been reflect on what we make out of the slower than expect capit spend  and let me summar my posit this way   i   m just uneasi about the outlook   if the  book gdp outlook is wrong  i   m guess we   re go to come in below it   i   m mind  of cours  of the standard error go in both direct and so forth  and we could certain have upsid surpris  i   m just say that i   m uneasi about that   i   m also uneasi about the inflat forecast   it could be on the high side or could hang higher   and i worri particular becaus it   s the one that produc the most difficult polici situat for us  with output come in below expect and inflat hang abov target   that   s the toughest   that   s the classic polici dilemma situat   it caus the most pain   so that   s the one i concentr on  it  sn   t seem to me that we   re like to have a tradit recess   money growth remain on the high side   in the past six month  m  has been run about   percent  and mzm about   percent   that  sn   t look like a recess   if you think about the expans phase of the cycl  with the except of hous there were no big imbal   we didn   t have the sort of dot com and telecom over invest that we had in the late     s   so what might be go on here  well  it   s clear that busi have an intens desir to see increas profit quarter after quarter after quarter  and when you get a revenu slowdown  they go after cost  even if it might not be perhap long run profit maxim  but they feel an intens pressur   then you get a keynesian kind of mechan in which some peopl get laid off and some thing get delay and so forth  and that produc some declin in incom  and it could lead to a prolong soft spot in the economi  that   s the kind of process that i think may be under way   if that   s what   s happen  we   re go to have to be patient and let it work out   so that   s where i am right now   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   our view of the outlook has chang sinc our last meet  but more in the balanc of risk and the sourc of uncertainti than in our actual forecast for growth   but just to go through the chang quick  we   ve reduc our forecast for growth in       a bit  to someth less than   percent  and we see more downsid risk to that forecast   we   ve move up the expect path of core pce inflat just a bit in light of recent number  but we have maintain essenti the same view as befor   that inflat will moder to around   percent by the end of this year and a bit below that in         we see the risk to this forecast still to the upsid   we face greater uncertainti about the near term outlook than we have over the past few meet   look to the medium term  although we haven   t yet reduc our es  of potenti growth  we   re a bit more concern than we   ve been about the strength of under structur product growth go forward   we have also chang our view of the appropri path of polici a bit  introduc a gentl move down now in the fed fund rate begin around the middl of the year   so this put us a bit below the assum path in the  book  but we assum a slower  smaller reduct in the nomin fed fund rate than the market   today   our forecast is quit close to that of the staff   s in the  book  and the basic stori is similar   our differ are the same as they have been for some  e   we have slight more growth and slight lower inflat   that reflect thing we talk about befor  differ view about inform dynam and about potenti growth   our view of the output gap and it evolut  howev  is similar  i have just a few point on some issu   on the growth front  the recent number suggest both a deeper adjust in hous and a broader weak in the economi than we anticip  notabl in capit good order   the effect of these develop on our forecast is not that larg  howev   their signific is more in the risk to the outlook and the uncertainti  the puzzl that the invest weak present for the medium term   on hous and consumpt  the probabl of the dark scenario is still small  but it is higher than it has been and deserv some attent   the dark scenario is the risk that the reduct in credit to the household sector amplifi the declin in hous demand  which lead to a greater adjust in price  with a risk of a more pronounc  prolong declin in growth and spend   monetari polici should not be direct at tri to put a floor on hous demand or on price  onli at limit the risk that the weak accumul substanti or spread to overal demand   regard capit spend  we just don   t have a good explan for whi   with margin that are still pretti good  reason earn growth  solid growth in aggreg demand here and global  relat low interest rate  and reason level of busi confid   spend has continu to come in well below our expect   this seri of disappoint  of cours  has been go on for some  e  it   s not just about the latest number for durabl good order   perhap this situat will prove transitori  but it justifi a bit more caution to the outlook   of these two risk   in hous and in invest   i   d say the latter matter more and is potenti more consequenti   but both of these effect are offset  in our basic view  by the expect strength in person incom growth go forward  by what are still fair favor overal financi condit  and by fair robust extern demand  regard product  product growth per quarter at an annual rate has  over the past ten quarter  come in signific below   percent  kind of close to the es  of the trend rate for the period between       and         some of the analyst who spend a lot of  e think about this are start to lose convict that trend growth is still in the neighborhood of     percent for the nonfarm busi sector   we   re still view the recent weak as transitori or cyclic  but the risk that trend growth is below our es  is  i think  increas  on inflat  despit the higher recent number  not much has realli chang in our view  we still expect core pce to move to below   percent over the forecast period  and we still see the risk as not get quit that moder   the sourc of the recent negat surpris in the core data  which seem concentr in medic servic  probabl don   t say much about monetari polici or broader inflat dynam  and inflat expect remain stabl at reason level   so our view of the growth outlook has chang a bit  but our view of the inflat outlook hasn   t chang much base on these number  on the market  as mani peopl have said and as bill discuss at the begin  i don   t see much that   s been troubl thus far   although correl across asset market have risen  overal liquid seem fine   there   s been veri limit contagion from mortgag into other credit market  debt issuanc seem to be continu   peopl are abl to rais money to financ corpor restructur invest   there is veri littl concern  i think  about substanti loss  on the basi of what   s happen to date  in the core of the financi system and veri limit evid of stress among the various fund   but it   s still earli in some way  and the fundament outlook for growth is a bit weaker and more uncertain   risk premium  credit spread  and volatil still look potenti vulner to a more substanti revers   the weak in the subprim market will take some  e to work through the full rang of secur issu against pool of collater that includ mortgag   the complex in valu structur mortgag product  the difficulti in design hedg that actual work against exposur to that risk  and uncertainti about the shape of the advers tail and that part of the credit spectrum are all condit that appli to a rang of other structur credit market and credit product   in the debat about the implic of this prolong yield curv invers  we have tend to side with those who have found comfort in the contrari signal you see in lower level of risk premium and credit spread   yet it   s possibl that the forc that may have been hold down forward rate are also hold down credit spread and hold up the valu of other asset and  therefor  may be mask weak in the economi rather than mask strength  on balanc  although the outlook still look fundament posit  we see a more complic and less benign set of risk to the outlook  more downsid risk to growth  and some continu concern that we won   t get enough moder in inflat   to us  this outlook justifi a stanc of polici with a path for the fed fund rate somewhat abov what is now price into the market   this  sn   t mean  in our view  that we need to signal that nomin rate go forward are more like to rise than to fall from current level  it mean onli that we should convey the sens that our view of the most like evolut of polici still impli a higher path than is now price into the market   we can afford to be patient befor adjust polici  as sandi said  but we need to have as much flexibl as possibl go forward   this suggest that we acknowledg that the overal balanc of risk has shift a bit toward neutral  toward a flat stanc of polici  but not all the way there   a delic task for us is to do this without induc a reaction in the market that pull forward signific more eas than has alreadi occur
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like mani other  i view the data over the intermeet period as not fundament undermin the basic contour of our expect forecast  we   re still on track for moder growth and gradual eb inflat   the economi has enough under strength  bol  by financi condit that remain quit support of growth  so that the hous correct should not be enough to knock the economi off the moder growth track  growth modest below potenti  along with the unwind of some special factor like rent increas  should allow further declin in inflat  real side data reflect the fact that the downshift from abov trend growth for sever year to expans at or a littl below trend hasn   t been entir smooth  and mayb we never should have expect it to be so   besid the overpr and overbuild of hous  busi appar built their stock of inventori and fix capit in anticip of continu strong growth  and we   re see downshift in demand for inventori and capit to align them with the slower pace of expect growth   busi typic also hoard labor under these circumst  result in weaker product growth  and we may just be see this adjust get under way  judg from the gradual upcreep in initi and continu claim   the inher uneven natur of the stock adjust process and the uncertainti around it help to explain both the overal contour of the recent data and the short run swing in the data and percept of them  a number of factor  most of them mention by other  do support expect of moder growth ahead   outsid the subprim market  financi condit remain support of growth   intermedi and long term rate are low in real as well as in nomin term   the dollar has fallen   the fallout from the recent turbul has been veri limit   asid from hous  a good portion of the inventori correct is behind us or is be put behind us   so over  e product ought to line up better with sale   both a rise in the nation ism index and increas in industri commod price  especi in metal  support the notion of a come recoveri in manufactur  though i admit the increas in metal price may be a factor of the global econom expans as well   continu good growth of job to date will support increas in person incom  and as mani have remark  growth in the rest of the world has been pretti strong   i was struck by the upward revis in rest of world growth in the  book despit weak in the unit state  the rise in oil price  and the declin in equiti valu   so as   remark  domest demand abroad seem to be strengthen  and i think this bode well for global extern adjust as well as for u s  export  but the inform we have receiv over the intermeet period not onli shift expect growth down a littl but also highlight some downsid risk to activ   in hous  those downsid risk center on the implic of the subprim debacl   will it affect hous demand  will lend term tighten beyond the subprim market and the mortgag market   how much will tighten spill over to other lend market  such as home equiti line of credit  and perhap affect consum demand   the possibl answer to these question seem to me to have downsid tail that are fatter than the upsid tail   unexpect weak in invest spend outsid hous and auto relat industri is anoth risk factor   the question is whether this weak repres just a short term adjust to moder growth or whether busi themselv see a downsid shift in under demand that we don   t see   financi condit may not remain as support of growth  besid the possibl of the drop of other shoe  such as privat equiti  as mani have mention   i see a distinct downsid risk to the staff   s assumpt of continu increas in equiti price given the likelihood that  if the economi evolv the way the staff anticip  long term interest rate will rise and profit will be veri disappoint to market analyst  despit weaker spend  we still face upsid risk to the gradual downdrift in inflat  recent data haven   t been as favor to deceler as we would have hope   softer invest  slower growth of product  and continu strength in labor market could suggest a slower path of trend product growth   if so  we would need to adjust down our expect for growth  and labor cost would get a boost even at slower growth rate unless increas in nomin wage also downshift pretti prompt   good growth in labor demand could suggest a stronger path for demand and less slack than the staff is es    final  the nairu could well be lower than the   percent that the staff is es   especi in light of the relat slow updrift in mani measur of compens   but  at     percent  the unemploy rate is low by histor standard  and this suggest to me that the risk from resourc util remain toward higher inflat   in sum  downsid risk to our maximum employ object have increas  but i do not think they outweigh the continu upsid risk to more moder inflat  at least not yet  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me say at the outset that i believ the moder growth scenario is the most like for        but as mani of you have alreadi discuss  i had thought that busi fix invest particular was a veri real upsid opportun and now consid it a veri real downsid risk   the  book mark down bfi over the next coupl of quarter  but i think there   s further reason to be concern about it  let me confin the rest of my remark to the market tumult of the past sever week and give you my view on that  which are broad consist with what bill said at the outset   first  my sens of what the market seem to be tell us is that the real economi is weaker   the first quarter earn number that bill show us veri much reflect a trend that we could be see more of and that suggest some downsid risk in the equiti market that governor kohn refer to a moment ago   a markdown of data in the fourth quarter of       disappoint data regard busi fix invest  the weak in the subprim market  and so forth suggest to me that perhap the market have been react to a u s  domest economi that is in somewhat weaker shape than we could have expect even a coupl of month ago  what was the caus of the market tumult of the past sever week   when market cannot singl out a proxim caus  they have a tendenc either to construct one or to be complet dismiss   in my view  some subset of rather sophist investor over the past six month or so have been look for an opportun  or mayb i should say an excus  to pull back from certain market in which credit risk spread have been unusu low  and over the past sever week  they found one   there has been a general discomfort with market price for perfect and level of volatil that seem uncorrel with the real world which we   re all tri to analyz   mani of us have note in speech dure the past coupl of quarter that we have been surpris by the level of certainti impli in market price  and i think that messag is now start to find it way into the marketplac   so the tumult and volatil that we   ve seen in the past sever week will  as it continu  make it more difficult for us to gaug what   s go on  might this financi market tumult then actual affect the real economi go forward  general  i would have said that these financi market activ are quit distinct from the real economi   but in the case of busi fix invest  i can   t help but believ that the market uncertainti  the talk of recess  the anim spirit that certain have been negat affect   all might affect some board of director and manag team that are tri to decid about whether to step on the gas on cap ex or might get them to retreat even further   given strong balanc sheet  incred strong oper cash flow  and all of the momentum that they should have  i   m as puzzl as     as to whi we haven   t seen that capit invest   the tumult in the market in recent week give me more reason to be concern there   perhap these manag team are go to find share buyback to be even more compel compar with the altern of capit invest  in general  i took the volatil of the market at first blush as probabl be a proper wake up call to folk who had gotten perhap a littl too complac about what was go on  particular in the credit market   have spent a lot of  e in new york in the past sever week  i think that  if that was a wake up call  mani market particip seem to have hit the snooz button   laughter   mani are review their portfolio and risk posit certain  and we are see a bit more caution   perhap that   s justifi by real econom fundament or by some lem phenomenon   that is  most of these invest bank and other asset manag have in front of them as they   re make decis a credit risk button and a client risk button   over the past coupl of year  they have alway hit the client risk button   that is  i don   t want to take client risk  i don   t want to lose this busi   so they have hit that button  and the credit market have been so accommod and the syndic market so strong that they   ve been abl to make some free money there   for a short  short window after februari     they seem pois to hit the credit risk button   one senior credit risk offic at a major institut told me that he was veri popular again  peopl want him in everi meet as they were make underwrit commit   he call me back a few day later and said     no one want to talk to me again       laughter   so i worri whether that wake up call has actual been felt  now  could this market volatil of recent week spread beyond the subprim market and lead to the kind of credit crunch that would have meaning downsid risk to the economi   i tri to imagin the circumst in which that would come   first  i look at financi intermediari  and rather than tri to distinguish between commerci bank and invest bank  hedg fund  and other privat equiti  i tri to think about them as be creator of credit  distributor of credit  or holder of credit  forget all other label that are associ with them   typic  befor the rather robust capit market of the past sever year  most of these institut would decid which of those area they would be in    do they creat product and get them off their book  or do they make big bet by decid what to hold and not   mani of them have now decid that they could be in all three busi   all three busi were profit   to the extent that a portfolio posit no longer fit  they could sell it or syndic it veri quick   in this new environ  howev  with new volatil  these portfolio hold over  e may prove harder to liquid  and the out of the money option that the creator of structur product have been write may no longer be free   a coupl of week ago  warren buffett describ one of these financi hedg fund phenomena   he describ the group as the    innov  the imit  and then the swarm mass of incompet       laughter   i won   t describ who is in what categori in these market  but mani financi institut seem to be follow one particular premier invest bank that has manag to be a creator of product  to be a syndic  and to be take veri larg princip posit  what happen if these other financi institut get uncomfort as these market tighten  to the extent that they decid that they no longer want to be in the equiti bridg busi  to cite one exampl  which presid   rais  in a veri larg  high leverag transact recent  a coupl of the invest bank decid to put up a coupl billion dollar of capit  and they were short some equiti check   typic  they would then go to a seri of other bank  bring them into the deal  and then tri to syndic that quick   but the first invest bank that were involv want to make sure that there was no competit in the syndic market   so three non u s  financi institut wrote    billion check for an extrem small fee and agre to hold that billion dollar of equiti on their own balanc sheet for a term of not less than     day and to syndic it later onli to those who would be satisfactori to the lead invest bank   to what extent over the next twelv month will they and other feel uncomfort in this new busi environ with that kind of equiti exposur   if that process end up be disord  there could be a rapid turn to risk avers   of cours  i think the more like case is that this is order and support of sustain growth  but that   s the financi situat in which i would get veri nervous veri quick  i think a second mechan by which the situat could becom wors involv a whole set of legal risk around the subprim market and uncertainti general over where liabil rest  through the good intent of policymak in the congress and in state legislatur  some uncertainti could be introduc into the foreclosur market and into the syndic market  mani enterpris state attorney general seem pois to do just the same  and that kind of legal risk could be veri danger for these credit market  final  what   that situat mean for us   i suspect that  besid our need to keep a focus on these financi market  it is what   s happen in the real economi   as we   ll discuss a bit more tomorrow  our statement should be and will necessarili be read in the context of our reaction to incom real data as oppos to our reaction to what   s happen in the financi market  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i veri much agre with presid  n   s character that  although some of the incom data are a bit weaker than we had been see  we certain shouldn   t overreact   op   we should react to what the data tell us about the futur  and i   m not sure we   ve learn an enorm amount about the futur over the past few month   actual dave has kept a veri steadi hand on the forecast throttl becaus we have seen a lot of data come in over the past six month  but they haven   t led to much chang in the  book forecast  and i think that   s quit reason   given that some of the number have come in slight weaker and given some of the market volatil  i think that uncertainti is a bit up  so the tail are somewhat fatter  and i agre with the number of peopl who had said that  quick look at gdp from the c   i   g   net export context  i think net export will be reason robust as world growth  at least over the next few quarter  is go to be fair strong  we also heard a lot of anecdot support for that   on both the state and feder level  govern spend is like to continu at a pace that will certain not reduc demand and may have the potenti to add to demand   but when it come to consumpt and invest  that   s where the uncertainti are   i won   t restat the concern that sever of you have rais about the deepen puzzl in invest   i mention this at the last meet   that for mani month we   ve been see veri good balanc sheet  good employ number  good sen ent  good return  and so on and so forth  but no pickup in invest   given that we   ve now gone at least six month without see that pickup  i am concern that  with the greater uncertainti that seem to be in the market  we may not see that pickup and that somehow our model may be miss someth that should be in there but that has not been there in the past  the other area of the greatest uncertainti is relat to the subprim market   as you know now  we and the other feder regul put out for comment   actual right at the end of the week of the increas concern about volatil in the subprim market   guidanc with respect to subprim mortgag  the so call     s and     s   that is still out for comment   we   re veri mind of some of the comment that have been rais here about whether that could inappropri reduc the suppli of credit in this market  and in the notic of propos rulemak  we have realli emphas question about what the unintend consequ are   so we want to make sure that we get inform in on that   some loan that were made may have been inappropri  but there may have been some that were complet appropri   we want to make sure that  when we put out the guidanc  we don   t choke off the appropri loan  the supervis and regul staff has survey five activ lender in the subprim market that repres about    percent of that market   we   ve gotten data so far from three of the five  from some of them it   s a bit difficult to get the data quick becaus of a fair amount of manag turnov  but we are still work on it   but i think it   s a healthi thing that there are some delay   what   s interest is that one of the main concern is refinanc   what will happen to these guy becaus this market seem to be dri up   as we discuss at the begin  it   s realli the variabl rate subprim market   the subprim market is rough    percent of the total mortgag outstand   the variabl rate subprim is about     percent of total mortgag outstand  near two third of the subprim market   the fix rate part has not had ani uptick in delinqu   becaus of the invers of the yield curv  the peopl who may be face increas in their variabl rate may be abl to refin into fix rate subprim   over        the averag introductori adjust rate subprim mortgag were in the   percent to   percent area   depend on the loan to valu ratio  debt to incom ratio  and so forth   if incom was state   right now  to refin into fix rate  the rang is about     percent to     percent   it   s fair similar  so mani of these peopl may be abl to move into this area  one thing that we want to know is what happen after peopl get these loan   what do they do with them next   in the survey  about    percent of the loan were retain by the individu bank  and so we could follow through what happen to the borrow when they refinanc  but we see onli    percent   obvious this share could be heavili select  but it still may be somewhat interest to know that about    percent of those on whom we have some inform actual move into a prime product   about    percent went into a fix subprim  and the rest  about    percent  refinanc to anoth type of variabl subprim   so a fair number of these are abl to move either into prime or into fix subprim   although this sampl is obvious select  it say someth about the like effect go forward   the benefit  at least in the short run  of the invert yield curv are that mani of these individu will have a lot of opportun to refin into a fix product that will have payment similar to the one that they   re pay now rather than one that would be much higher  that said  the situat suggest that the concern about what will happen to the market may not be as strong as some peopl have said   we still don   t know  as presid   said  a lot about the alt a market   that market almost by definit is low document or no document   the fico score tend to be higher   from the survey  a lot of these peopl appear to be self employ  so it becom more difficult to independ verifi the incom that they have   that   s a larg part of the market  but obvious potenti a veri riski part of the market   fortun  it   s not an enorm part of the market  and so it  sn   t seem to be a major challeng go forward  certain there are some potenti challeng  but i think some of the data from the survey are interest  with respect to inflat pressur  i think veri much like dave  now that he   s a much more balanc person than he was earlier in        that we see neither intensifi nor abat inflationari pressur   you know  some of the number more recent have not been as favor as they could be  but they are certain by no mean out of control   expect continu to appear well anchor and well contain   we don   t know a lot about what   s drive short term to intermedi term inflat dynam   it   s hard to see lot of correl with unemploy rate  econom activ  resourc util  energi price  and other thing   i have been hope to see and we have been see a gradual downtrend that seem to be flatten out to neither intensifi nor abat  which leav us with some concern go forward about the upsid potenti to inflat
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   one way i think about the situat is to compar what   s happen now  not to the last meet  but to two meet befor   from decemb to januari we had posit news   now we have gone from januari to march  and we   ve had negat news   when you look at the overal pictur  we   re not in a veri differ place from where we were in decemb  although i do think that there   s actual more uncertainti around the forecast   so let me go into a littl more detail on this   i   m much less worri about the hous market as a serious downsid risk   first of all  i do see sign of stabil of demand  and i realli agre veri much with what randi just discuss   first of all  this market is a fair small part of the overal mortgag market   also  there are way for peopl to work out their situat   so the subprim market has realli been overplay in the media  and i do not see it as that big a downsid risk   i am comfort with the fact that we have lower our forecast on hous a bit  but the number that just came in recent were actual one that indic some stabil there   in term of hous demand  in particular  when i worri about the risk to the forecast  i   m realli much more worri about capit expenditur in term of invest   the problem here is that the fundament look fair strong and yet we haven   t seen strong busi fix invest   i ask myself     well  what   s go on     one possibl is that  in fact  there will be a bounceback   that these strong fundament in term of balanc sheet and so forth will produc actual stronger invest in the futur  and i think that is a signific possibl   howev  i   m realli a bit more worri that the weak capit expenditur may indic that someth deeper is wrong in term of the fundament   in particular  i   m a bit worri about the issu of what could be happen to product in the futur  we   ve seen some weaker number in term of product  and we think that is just sort of cyclic and not a chang in structur product   but mayb the busi sector is see someth that we   re not see  and in that context  busi may not be invest as much becaus they don   t see that product will be that strong in the futur   they don   t see the return in the futur  and so they   re not invest as much   that   s actual bad news in sever dimens   one dimens would be that it would actual indic a serious downsid risk in term of aggreg demand   also if product is lower  that   s not a good thing for inflat   so the situat here is one about which i   m not super worri  but the environ is more complic  and it make our job more interest    laughter   there is  of cours  the chines curs that you should live through interest  e  but we   ll have more interest fomc meet  on the inflat front  i am comfort with the view that the  book and other have express that we should expect some moder decreas in inflat   in fact  the latest data don   t realli get me that nervous on this   howev  we must recogn that  when we have more anchor inflat expect  it   s actual harder to forecast the littl blip in inflat becaus what   s realli go on is what   s left   it is no longer the trend but just the transitori movement  and those are particular hard to forecast   so there is a bad side to the overal better news  but i think the key is that inflat expect seem to be veri solid ground   it   s hard to know exact what the number are  but they seem to be around   percent   so it   s realist to think that  in fact  inflat is go to move toward the   percent level  although there may be some blip up and down  howev  it is also import to recogn that i don   t see ani reason for it drop much below that   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   thank you veri much for the comment   i   m go to offer  as i alway do  a brief summari and invit ani comment and correct  and then i   d like to add a few comment of my own   most particip today agre that growth look as though it   s go to be slower  but there is some divers of opinion about how persist the slowdown would be   mani peopl have mark down growth expect for the remaind of the year  and there was a general sens that the uncertainti about growth prospect and downsid risk have increas   howev  some peopl saw the current slowdown as onli a soft patch that would be revers soon   hous remain weak  and some particip note the risk that problem in mortgag and credit market and increas foreclosur rate might contribut to further weak  howev  other felt that the hous situat has not chang materi sinc the last meet  the slowdown in capit invest drew more concern  in part becaus it has prove difficult to explain   an inventori correct continu  but automobil inventori have been brought into line  some factor that will support growth includ a boom global economi and stronger govern spend at both the feder and the state and local level   the labor market continu to be tight  with some note increas in wage   develop in the labor  hous  and credit market will be import in determin the futur cours of consumpt  sever particip point to potenti financi risk  includ possibl knock on effect of the subprim mortgag problem and the possibl of the dri up of current abund liquid and financi market   corpor earn are also like to slow   if these risk materi  they could add to downsid pressur on output   howev  some thought that financi condit will remain support   some  but not all  think that inflat will continu to moder  albeit veri slowli   there is general disappoint with recent inflat read  and some were skeptic that ani meaning progress against inflat is be made   in particular  resourc util pressur  particular tight labor market  pose a longer term inflat threat   import price and slower product growth also add to inflat risk   the view of most particip were that upsid inflat risk still outweigh downsid risk to output  that uncertainti has increas  and that the tail of the distribut have becom fatter  are there comment   if not  let me just add a few thought   it   s veri difficult to speak last   all the good idea have alreadi been present   so i   ll say just a few thing  i think the growth outlook is slight wors   the hous market is  of cours  central to near term develop   the central scenario that hous will stabil some  dure the middl of the year remain intact  but there have been a few negat innov   we   ve note the subprim issu and the possibl of foreclosur  reduc confid  and tighten credit term  and i   ve also note that report from builder about the spring sell season have not been particular upbeat  in general   at the same  e  we continu to see rough stabil in sale  start  and permit   the effect of the declin in subprim lend may have alreadi been most seen  sinc that has slow from last fall   mortgag rate  of cours  remain quit low  and the labor market is a key determin of hous demand and of mortgag delinqu  particular cross section   across the countri  there   s a veri close correl between foreclosur rate and state unemploy rate   so long as the labor market remain strong  i would think that the general health of the hous market would be improv   the hous market  i think  will follow the same scenario  but there are a few negat innov  there was a lot of discuss about capit invest  and i share the puzzlement about whi that   s happen   like governor    i am concern that it might signal someth about product   anoth possibl in the current environ goe back to my ph d  thesi on the effect of uncertainti on invest  which found that greater uncertainti can make peopl delay their commit   in our last meet  we discuss the possibl upsid risk to consumpt   i think that risk is much diminish now   our retail sale have been quit flat  and the strong growth of consumpt in the first quarter is almost entir due to the decemb blip  which will carri through to the quarter arithmet   but consumpt is veri like to slow   gas price are anoth reason that consumpt is like to slow   the labor market  again  remain strong   i agre with the  book that there is some likelihood of soften go forward   in particular  i think governor kohn mention that the slow product growth we   re see could be consist with some labor hoard in this late stage of the cycl  again  i   ve mark down my growth expect onli a bit  but if we were handicap recess  i   m afraid that risk has probabl gone up a bit   i would cite at least three reason   first  there seem to be a pretti good chanc that potenti output growth is lower than in the past  and almost by definit  if growth is lower  then the chanc of negat quarter is greater   second  the  book has a    basi point increas in unemploy occur stabli over the next two year  if that happen  it will be the first  e it has ever happen    laughter   general speak  increas in unemploy tend either not to occur or to be bigger than    basi point   final  we   ve discuss the financi market sensit  which are have an effect  so that chang in the outlook could have pretti substanti feedback effect onto the economi through the stock market  other financi market  and credit market   so i think  as presid      that the tail in that direct is unfortun somewhat fatter  likewis with inflat  the news was disappoint   we knew that there would be   and we have seen   month to month volatil   it is difficult  as presid pianalto note  to make a firm conclus base on the recent data about whether or not inflat is moder   i would just note that rent and owner    equival rent are still pretti import here   they have not yet slow much  which may have to do with the natur of the uncertainti about the hous market   that possibl will be help go forward   at an earlier meet i indic that medic cost were a risk  and they have  inde  prove to be a risk  speak about inflat make me reflect on the difficulti of measur aggreg suppli in general   as we think about the economi go forward  we face two countervail possibl  one  which i and sever other have alreadi mention  is that potenti output growth may well be lower than mani outsid and mayb even the  book think   obvious that will make it difficult to get econom slack and will make this situat much more challeng   at the same  e  the lack of wage acceler at least rais the possibl that the nairu might be somewhat lower than   percent  which would be help in the other direct   with respect to inflat  again  as i said  i   m disappoint by the recent number   i don   t get a sens from busi peopl or from survey and so on that the general public   s worri about inflat has increas veri much  except insofar as they perceiv that inflat is constrain the fed from act   so  again  i don   t think we   ve seen an advers breakout by ani mean  but obvious we   re go to have to remain veri vigil and make sure that we maintain our credibl on the inflat front  as the last item  i would like   to distribut tabl     we made a coupl of chang in the descript of the economi   he can make a few comment  and then everyon will have an opportun to look at it overnight  and we can discuss the communic issu tomorrow
i have the unenvi posit of be the last speed bump between you and the open bar across the street    laughter   in the interest of  e  i   d like to draw your attent to the latest version of tabl   and then deliv the rest of my remark tomorrow   that way you   ll get a chanc to cogit over the chang to the tabl overnight  and i will get to showcas an outfit that i anticip will be just as fetch as this one tomorrow    laughter   the latest version of tabl    which was just distribut  introduc modifi word in the rational portion of altern b   in section    the factor support growth are made a littl more explicit  includ some of the thing that you   ve spoken about today   favor financi condit and the recent mix indic   as for section    the cpi releas was a touch to the high side of expect  and the medic servic compon of the ppi even more so   this situat make it like that the core pce price index will be disappoint and argu for substitut materi similar to the bracket materi in the bluebook   as for the risk assess  this draft continu to character inflat as the committe   s    princip    concern  although some of you would prefer to identifi it as your    predomin    concern  part becaus of the precedenti use of that word in the chairman   s monetari polici tes oni   i hope for your sake that your hotel room have both a gideon bibl and an unabridg dictionari    laughter   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   i hope you   ll join me now in bid farewel to governor bie   we will reconven tomorrow at      a m     the tabl to which mr  reinhart refer is append to this transcript  appendix      meet recess  march               of     march            morn session
thank you  mr  chairman
how nice you look today
thank you   that will be note in the transcript    laughter
i like his red vest better
that won   t be note in the transcript    laughter   i   ll be refer to the materi right in front of you   financi market were volatil over the intermeet period amid a repric of riski asset   as can be seen in the top left panel of your first exhibit  monetari polici expect shift down almost    percentag point  on net  at longer horizon  and uncertainti about that path  the top middl panel  spike higher   investor now admit the possibl of much lower polici rate just six month from now   the red bar in the top right panel   compar with the hollow dash bar wit at the  e of the januari meet   a part of this downward revis was due to concern that strain in the subprim mortgag market would leav a more signific mark on spend than previous suspect  as shown by the blue line in the middl left panel  the spread on the bbb minus rate tranch of a cds index cover subprim mortgag that were origin in the first half of last year balloon in respons to remark poor payment perform   about the same  e that investor rethought the prospect for the mortgag market  they mark down the price of equiti consider  the bottom left panel   the combin of lower equiti price and an expect of mark easier futur monetari polici presum signal that market think the prospect for econom growth are now less bright   against this backdrop  nomin ten year treasuri yield fell about    basi point  as shown by the dot blue line in the right panel   longer term tip yield  the red dash line  fell as much as their nomin counterpart  leav inflat compens littl chang   the ten year bbb corpor yield  the solid black line  follow the downward track of compar treasuri yield until februari     keep the correspond spread littl chang   sinc februari     this risk spread  like other  has widen modest   as shown in the top panel of exhibit    the yield on the two year treasuri note remain well below the intend feder fund rate  the last  e this spread was so decid negat was in       the shade area  late in the previous econom expans   as shown in the middl left panel  the committe began      with three success polici tighten  which brought the feder fund rate to     percent   at those meet  market particip had expect some firm   that is shown by the dot line plot the path of the expect feder fund rate for each meet   by summer  howev  investor had taken out    materi use by mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix     the anticip of firm  subsequ  they price in polici eas   this occur as forecast for real activ soften  as shown at the middl right by the blue chip consensus forecast for real gdp growth over       the solid line  and for the annual averag      unemploy rate  the dot line   as note in the bottom left panel  in the first seven meet of the year  the committe held that the balanc of risk was tilt toward heighten inflat pressur   in part  it seem from reread the transcript  becaus no one want to be seen as lack vigil against inflat  three lesson from this experi are note at the bottom right   first  statement languag can hamper your flexibl   second  downward move in financi market yield can be inform   third  those forward look adjust in financi market can help to offset the effect of gradual in policymak   in write the bluebook  we tri to offer a greater measur of flexibl for polici go forward in altern a and b   you might want that flexibl if you harbor serious concern about the hous market  the subject of the top panel of exhibit     in particular  some member might be of the view that the turmoil in the subprim market may prompt a signific pullback in fund for hous  steepen the slide in home sale  the left panel  at the same  e  homebuy attitud  the middl panel  have improv  no doubt in part becaus the drop in market yield has pull down mortgag rate for prime borrow  the right panel   given these cross current  you might be inclin to await more inform and be prepar to move in either direct when the  e come   wait a bit might not seem so cost  in that the real feder fund rate  the solid line in the middl panel  is right on top of the equilibrium real feder fund rate consist with the  book forecast   by that measur  at least  maintain the current real feder fund rate at   percent would impli close the output gap in the next coupl of year   keep the fed fund rate steadi for a  e is the prescript from the standard op  control exercis with the frb us model with a   percent inflat goal  the solid line in the bottom panel    as explain in a recent memo and a bluebook box  the inertia of inflat in the frb us model is due import to the sluggish of inflat expect   if you believ that the public could be made to understand an inflat goal of     percent relat quick and costless  perhap as in the    immedi recognit    scenario plot as the dash line  you might not feel the need to hurri to move the fed fund rate even if your inflat target was     percent   this was the first bluebook in some  e that fulli live up to it offici titl     monetari polici altern      that is  we provid three altern for the level of the intend feder fund rate   the polici eas of altern a and the firm of altern c  howev  may have an air of unreal to them becaus market particip seem so firm convinc that you will stand pat today  and i will expand on that issu with the aid of exhibit     the top panel plot the es  effect of fomc polici announc on near term polici expect over the past six year   to be sure  a    basi point cut or hike would translat into a    basi point surpris  someth that has not been seen sinc        by the way  the color of the bar expos regular in your behavior   polici eas  the red bar  tend to be surpris  wherea firm  the blue one  tend to be more predict   that is  you   ve shown a reveal prefer to be more will to surpris market on the downsid than on the upsid   but befor you obsess too much on the peril of surpris market in general  i would note that when the bank of england tighten    basi point on januari     fifti one out of the fifti one economist survey by bloomberg just befor the meet had expect no chang   as shown in the middl left panel  rate did rise that day but by a mute amount at longer matur   as shown at the middl right  the imprint on ten year gilt yield was not long last  nor was impli volatil deflect from it downward track   as to the direct of the potenti polici surpris  the case for altern a  as laid out in the bottom panel  probabl rest on the belief that the ongo weak in the hous sector will intensifi and be join by soft in some other sector   one candid is busi spend given that  as at the left  purchas manag see busi condit as tread water and  as at the right  view their custom    inventori as too high   the polici eas in altern a  and perhap even the hold pattern of altern b  might come at the cost of an increas in expect inflat  a concern that would be at the forefront for anyon inclin to the    basi point firm of altern c  the subject of exhibit     as shown in the top panel  inflat expect as survey from household  the solid line  or profession forecast  the dot line  remain abov what mani of you have identifi as your comfort zone for inflat   the appar poor

real net export to gdp growth was     percentag point  and as shown in the tabl at the middl right  the staff forecast foreign econom growth to continu to expand robust   the fact that the recent angst about the u s  expans is not wide share intern may lend some comfort that econom growth at home still has a firm foot   you might also view this meet as an opportun to set market particip straight about your prioriti   polici firm would disabus peopl of the notion that the fomc respond mechan to a declin in stock price   inde  the still low level of impli volatil  as in the bottom left panel  may suggest that investor maintain the faith that monetari polici will smooth everi road   the bottom right panel plot five minut chang in the s p      along the horizont axi  against five minut chang in the one year ahead eurodollar futur rate  along the vertic axi  sinc februari      in the past few week  interest rate expect have been veri respons to equiti price   possibl suggest a widespread belief that the fomc support equiti price
thank you   are there question for     governor kohn
on exhibit    the two year treasuri spread over the target feder fund rate  for a while we have been discount the tendenc of the ten year rate to be below the fed fund rate becaus term premium have been unusu low  so we   ve said it   s not as indic of expect weak   are term premium low for the two year rate  or do we know
to start where we are now  to get to about    basi point or zero at the ten year mark  you probabl should smooth across the matur structur   yes  inde  the two year term premium are lower  so some of the low level of the spread   reflect less compens for risk   at the same  e  we haven   t done much to chang our es  of term premium at veri short matur  and the impli set of futur rate do point downward and give you    basi point of eas in the next year
i had essenti the same question   if you take the two year rate over the past year  how much of that could be explain by a chang in the term premium   you said term premium are low  but i   m talk about the chang
you have to go back about two year   the term premium start declin about two year ago
but quantit  how big is that
quantit  a good portion is due to lower term premium
okay   but then    that have much bear on  let   s say  eurodollar futur a year or a year and a half out
well  you   d assum that there are arbitrag opportun across the collect of fix incom secur  and lower term premium in the treasuri market are not a peculiar attribut just for the treasuri market   they say someth about investor    attitud toward risk and percept of risk  and that should be reflect in all fix incom secur   so yes  we think those term premium are lower everywher
but if we take the chang in the eurodollar market just sinc the last fomc meet  or take your exhibit    the top right hand panel or the top left hand panel  my instinct is that it has to reflect almost entir chang in market view about the futur fed fund rate
i think your instinct would be guid by the top middl panel  which show that impli volatil went up  which would not be consist with term premium go down   we would first see  at the veri short end  that the sensit of the term premium to volatil is lower than it is with longer capit instrument and then would interpret the shift in the upper left panel as reflect expect about polici
are there other question   if not  we   re readi for our polici go round   presid pool
first of all  i like altern b   i   ll start with that   i think we have a coupl of issu that are pull in differ direct   vinc talk about this a bit   a lot of peopl in the market seem to believ that de facto our inflat object is more like     to     percent   they don   t realli believ   to     that may mean a lot of resist in the marketplac to revis of expect  which tend to feed through the whole economi and to keep current inflat higher than would otherwis be the case   clear  we don   t want to do anyth that would reinforc the market   s view that we   re will to keep the current inflat rate or that our upper end is     percent   i think that there   s a lot to be said for state that our inflat object is     percent  plus or minus      howev  the whole rational of tri to have veri firm entrench inflat expect in the market is to maxim employ and growth over the long run and to reduc the cyclic effect on employ   inflat is an inerti process  and we would like to avoid a situat in which we hang on longer than is realli necessari so that employ is driven down if the economi generat some cumul weak   that   s a major part of the polici problem  so i ask myself this question   the market anticip  let   s say by the end of       a fed fund rate that is    basi point below the staff assumpt in the  book   i think    is the right number   wouldn   t it be desir for us to tri to chang the market   s expect on the fed fund rate to match our own  book expect   my answer is clear    no      there is a lot to be said for allow market fluctuat in rate to help stabil the economi  and i think that vinc was get at this point in talk about the experi in the last downturn   that the market can help stabil the real economi by move rate   we can avoid send wrong signal about our longer run inflat object by delay ani polici respons and let the market do a lot of the stabil work for us in term of the real economi   obvious  if the economi eventu weaken  we have to follow through   the statement languag goe veri much in that direct  perhap as much as we can possibl craft   so i realli like the polici   no chang in the rate   and the languag that are in altern b   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i am inclin toward leav the rate unchang  so that would be altern b   i   d like to comment on a coupl of thing   although the downsid risk to growth appear to have increas somewhat on a nation level sinc the last meet  i continu to expect that we will see a pickup in the economi  as i said ye day  over the year   at the same  e  i am obvious disappoint  as other are  that the recent inflat number have not continu to show the progress we saw last fall   consequ  i think that the risk of inflat will remain abov accept level for a while  and that situat on balanc outweigh the downsid risk to growth   so while i favor no chang in polici  i also continu to favor statement languag that reflect an explicit bias toward firm or that make it veri clear to the market that we will remain firm until we actual see the inflat number consist improv  that lead me to the issu of the statement   i   m open to the languag there  but i like the word that    the committe   s princip polici    or    predomin     whichev you prefer     concern remain the risk that inflat will fail to moder as expect      i   m a littl uneasi about the part that say that    futur polici adjust    will be depend on event   i think it should say someth along the line of    the extent and  e of ani addit firm    so that we don   t confirm the market   s view that we will see a drop of as much as    basi point in the fed fund rate in the futur   our most like event are to hold firm as we go forward  and i   d like to convey that to the market one way or anoth   i   m open as to whether or not we do that by say that the bias is still on the upsid   i   m more concern that  by say that we   re go to look for data in the futur as defin which way we go  we will confirm the lower rate in the market  and that will complic our job rather than simplifi it   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i also favor keep the feder fund rate at the current level   as mani peopl remark ye day  that probabl stand the best chanc  for now anyhow  of keep growth at a reason good rate and reduc inflat at least a littl further  albeit gradual   the best chanc  that is  of come closest to our dual object   we are present with some challeng here on communic   the incom data certain have result in a downward adjust to expect growth  and i have highlight some downsid risk on the activ side   but output is still run close to potenti  in level term  it might even be beyond potenti  so it   s not a big problem   i think we all see the risk that inflat won   t moder as still be substanti and probabl greater than the risk of a shortfal in output   so our challeng is to recogn that the real economi has shift somewhat  but not a lot  while avoid give the impress that we   re react in ani way to the financi market develop  maintain our primari emphasi on inflat risk  and  i hope  not induc a further declin in expect feder fund rate   i agre with presid pool that the market construct is build in it own expect  but we shouldn   t push them ourselv   i   m not sure it   s possibl to meet all these goal    laughter  altern b come as close as i think i could come in acknowledg the mix data but emphas that we expect moder growth ahead  emphas that the recent read on inflat have been too high   particular the shift from last  e  which suggest that we had been a littl disappoint in the inflat and the inflat risk   and point out that the committe   s princip polici concern remain that inflat will fail to moder as expect  as for    princip    versus    predomin     i   m sort of indiffer   i guess i   d lean slight in the direct of    predomin    for the reason that   gave   you use    predomin    in your tes oni  mr  chairman   but it   s not a big deal  i think my prefer here  part reason from the fall of       would be to give as honest a represent of our view as possibl and to downgrad our worri about how the financi market are go to react   i myself am a littl haunt by novemb       when thing were slip away and the committe was afraid to shift it view becaus we were afraid of the effect on financi market   there was a lot of discuss at that meet  and i think in retrospect that we look a littl silli   so i think i would go with altern b as state here   if the market ralli a littl  so be it   from my perspect  this is as good an outlin of where i think the committe is as i could put togeth   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as has alreadi been suggest  i  too  favor maintain the fed fund rate today at    percent   as i said in the first go round  the data we have receiv sinc the last meet have certain increas my uncertainti about the forecast  but i think that the fundament haven   t chang that much   besid  as we discuss ye day  the earlier sign of moder inflat seem to have eb somewhat  and inflat still seem to be higher than i   d like to see   so i am still concern about the upsid risk to inflat   although my uncertainti about real growth has grown somewhat  it   not overcom my concern about inflat at this point   thus  until i see more convinc evid that the econom weak we see crop up here and there will be deeper and longer live  i would favor maintain the current fed fund rate   the combin of temporarili slower growth with a constant fed fund rate  in my view    repres a modest firm of polici  which i think will have desir effect both on inflat and on our credibl   cut rate at this  e  it seem to me  is inappropri as it   s unlik to have a signific effect on the weak in real output or invest in the short run in that the absolut level of long term real rate remain relat low   moreov  a cut in the rate is like to signal to the market that we are much less concern about inflat than we previous indic and that we are will to forgo our inflat object in search of modest increas in real growth   i simpli don   t believ that we can fine tune with such precis  and we shouldn   t encourag the market to believ that we can do so   such a move might also have undesir consequ for our reput and credibl   it also might put us on a downward path that we may find hard to resist and thus put our inflat object at risk   in other word  befor we take a step to cut rate  we need to have a much clearer pictur of where we   re go  and i think we don   t have that yet   howev  if the data evolv so as to suggest that the slowdown is go to worsen  the fomc clear would need to allow the fed fund rate to fall with equilibrium real rate but onli to a level and at a pace that are consist with make progress on our goal of price stabil   nevertheless  now is not the  e for that  turn to languag  regard the new altern b that you gave us ye day  i   m actual pretti happi with most of that languag   i think section     a veri good job  and i   m fair comfort with the languag in section     as i   ve said befor  although i am skeptic about inflat pressur moder on their own  i cannot bring myself to endors the languag of potenti  of capac util   my read of empir evid is that it cast serious doubt on the use of such measur to forecast inflat   i don   t like the idea of perpetu in the marketplac a belief that it might be use becaus in the long run it can damag our own credibl   but you   ve heard me say that befor  and i won   t belabor that point ani further   the final section on the balanc of risk is the most signific part of this statement  and i have a coupl of point to make there   frank  i   m pretti happi with the way the new version read   i think it repres a slight recognit that the economi has weaken  without be veri explicit about it  it   s more of an implicit acknowledg   so i could live with the languag as it is propos  presid hoenig suggest that he would like    firm      i guess i   m a littl torn   i   m sympathet with that point of view  but as i suggest  if in fact the real rate is fall  by our hold the rate constant we are actual make a slight firm of polici   i   m not sure the market fulli understand that subtleti   of either that languag or that view of polici   but i think it might be help to communic it at some point  which is back to the communic issu   so  frank  i   m pretti happi with leav the fed fund rate as it is  and i could live with the languag in altern b as it is
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also favor leav our polici rate unchang today  and i support the languag in altern b  although i find myself sympathet to the assess of risk languag in altern a   the incom inform we have receiv sinc our last meet has led me to believ that the economi may not be as firm foot as i thought at our last meet   howev  my sen ent about the under strength in the economi has taken more than a few turn in the past year  and i think the assess of risk languag in altern a may convey greater certainti over these real side risk than i think we current know   so i think that remov the    addit firm    phrase that we   ve been use for some  e more accur reflect how the softer tone in the incom data has influenc my assess of risk   it   s still my view that the predomin risk that we face come from the possibl that we   re not make the kind of progress we want to make against the inflat trend that i believ our polici are tri to engin   so i   m comfort with no chang in the fed fund rate today and the languag in altern b   i am indiffer about the issu of whether we use    princip    or    predomin      i think that  perhap becaus you   ve use the word    predomin    in your tes oni  use it here help us  but i can go either way   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i  too  am veri much in favor of stay put with our current stanc of polici   as i said ye day  my own sens  as i listen to the commentari around the tabl  is not terribl differ from that of everybodi els   a sens that risk have risen on both side of the forecast   but i   m still will to believ that we are realli more in an ebb and flow process here  as we were last fall  and that the under strength of the economi is such that the chanc go forward are that we   re on fair solid foot   in that regard  i would like to stay where we are   i would like to have a littl more pressur on inflat to prevent it from move up in the futur and to keep it on the downward trajectori that   s in the  book forecast   so for all those reason  i   m comfort with altern b  with stay put   although i think that vinc is right on the mark   that it   s a good thing we now have a set of altern   i think that have that set is reflect of the under risk in the economi   we are do ourselv a favor by look serious at whether or not we should move down  stay put  or go up at this  e becaus there are argument in all three direct  depend on where you come out on the risk to the economi   so i was glad to see that evolut of the bluebook  in term of languag for altern b  in general i   m pretti happi with it   if it were just up to me  i would go with a shorter form of section     i would not put in the list of thing that are support the moder pace of expans over the come quarter   i would just leav that alon  and let the two sentenc stand on their own   that recent indic have been mix  the adjust to the hous sector is ongo  but the economi seem like to continu expand at a moder pace   i just think that not modifi it by all the thing that we expect to continu to be strong allow us a bit more flexibl go forward   it  sn   t give the market a lot of thing to watch  in particular   to some degre  mention financi condit as still favor heighten the market   s attent to our attent to financi condit  if that make ani sens to anybodi   it just elev that consider to someth with which i   m realli not all that comfort   i think we   re better off with a simpl statement that the economi still seem on track from the perspect of growth   the inflat statement in section   is right on   i like the way it   s state   i could go with either    princip    or    predomin         princip    seem a littl softer than    predomin     but that   s just a matter of tast   i do take the point that the second sentenc in the assess of risk   that futur polici adjust depend on the evolut rather than the assumpt of the next one be a tighten   is a big chang  and i think the market are go to see it as a big chang   it is appropri reflect of what i heard around the tabl ye day and what we ought to be think about at this  e   so i   m veri much in favor of that way of talk in this announc   but i think we ought to recogn that the market are go to see it as a big chang   so with a littl modif  i   m on board with altern b
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i   m larg in agreement with all i   ve heard around the tabl so far this morn   as other have comment  i think ye day   s discuss and the incom data on the economi suggest that uncertainti about the outlook  in term of both growth and inflat  has increas at least a bit  but i don   t think they provid a signific reason to chang polici and adjust the feder fund rate at this point   so i continu to favor altern b and most of the languag associ with it   i   m perfect happi with section   and   as draft   with regard to section    although i can certain go with it as it is  i would suggest replac the second sentenc in section    altern b  with the second sentenc from altern c  and let it go at that   i would do that to highlight the uncertainti that surround the judgment that inflat is go to moder or deceler a bit from here   so i think that highlight that has some valu and it is consist with our concern   that a lot of uncertainti is associ with this   and it would be valuabl to get that thought in there   that   s my one suggest   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the bluebook altern b  both leav the feder fund rate unchang and also the languag basic as it stand   i think the current stanc of polici is like to fo  an economi that gradual move toward a soft land of the type portray in the  book forecast  but obvious i have becom much more focus on the downsid risk to econom activ sinc we met in januari   on the inflat front  the news hasn   t much alter my view   i still think core inflat is like to edg down this year and next  but i certain think it   s too soon to conclud that ani new lower trend has set in   and i do definit see upsid risk  given that labor market are still somewhat tight  oil price have risen  and the dollar has fallen   so for me  the risk do seem more balanc in the sens that there are downsid risk to real activ and upsid risk to inflat  and i think it is appropri   i agre with cathi   s comment   to reflect that in the statement   for a minut i contempl support the languag about the risk assess in altern a  but realli  upon further reflect  i like altern b veri much   the shift to    futur polici adjust    from    firm    appropri hint at downsid risk  as we all recogn in our discuss ye day  i agre with vinc that it creat greater polici flexibl for us and let the market work in this stabil manner   even so  it   retain an asymmetr bias  which i think market expect  and i consid it reason becaus  on the whole  i do remain somewhat more concern about inflat risk  and it is wise for our messag on that to be consist over  e
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i mention ye day  my overal assess of the economi call for growth to averag somewhat below potenti in       and to improv in        and i expect labor market will remain tight with the unemploy rate stay below   percent   core inflat is higher than i like   i see some forc that will help moder inflat toward   percent  but i   m concern that these will not be strong enough to push inflat below   percent within a reason  e frame   so while i recogn the downsid risk to growth  i still think the inflat situat pose the greater risk  and at this point  the cost of a polici mistak on inflat are greater than those of a mistak on growth   the weak growth environ   suggest that the short term equilibrium real interest rate may be lower now  if so  then maintain the fed fund rate at    percent may provid a bit more polici restraint and with it somewhat more impetus for reduc inflat   howev  the analysi in the bluebook suggest that this effect will be minor beyond the near term   so with the increas uncertainti over the growth outlook sinc our last meet  it seem reason to continu to hold polici steadi while we gather more inform   so i do favor altern b  let me make some comment on the languag   i agre with cathi     s comment on section     of stop the statement after the phrase    moder pace over come quarter     just put a period there   i agre with everyth she said as reason for take out the addit languag  and i would just add that  as now written  it mention hous again   so hous is mention twice in that section  and i think it   s unnecessari to add those addit phrase at the end   the statement come out much more succinct and focus if we stop it after the phrase    come quarter      on the question about    predomin    versus    princip     i prefer stick with    predomin    sinc it was use befor in your tes oni   it would be my guess that the definit is probabl the same   i don   t think that   s what should determin the use   i just think it   s better if we   re consist here  so i would have a prefer for use the same languag that was use in the tes oni  on the    addit firm    question that tom hoenig rais  i have some sympathi with him on this   as the bluebook said  it   s difficult to know how the market will react to this chang   it   s alway tentat how the market are go to react  but the bluebook said that now the judgment is more tentat than usual as to how they   ll react to this chang in the statement  i think it will reinforc the market   s anticip of futur polici eas and probabl increas expect of eas   but have said that  i think the new version   more accur reflect our view and the view around this tabl   so it   s a close call  but on balanc i think we ought to make the chang  and i would support the languag in section   as written
thank you   presid pool
i think the like effect of take the firm languag out this afternoon will be as     suggest   but the more import point is how it condit the market over the period to the next meet   there i think it   s go to be driven by the flow of incom data  and i think that   s the more import point
well  we   ll see    laughter
good answer   i think it   s tentat   the judgment is tentat
that   s total immateri to whether this is go to affect what the rate is at the next meet   i mean  lot of chang to rate could occur between now and the next meet  or the effect of this statement on rate after this meet could persist until the next meet   so i don   t see how it   s relev  bill
well  like so mani other  i agre with keep the fund rate at the current level and the languag in altern b   we   re experienc real growth at about the rate we expect  but inflat is no longer declin   have said that  i   m comfort with the current polici and don   t see a need to move until we becom convinc that our forecast for inflat moder won   t be realiz   in regard to the languag  i   m not yet a ma  of the nuanc   laughter  and so i don   t have strong opinion on    predomin    versus    princip     becaus    predomin    is consist with the past  it   strike me as be slight stronger  therefor  i   ll go with the consensus  but i would favor that
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  ye day i indic concern for the downsid  even though i come from a district that is run a pretti warm economi   my sound with busi leader and my interpret of what i heard around the tabl ye day lead me to conclud that we are perhap one revis or one shock  includ possibl a financi market shock or a credit crunch shock  away from a recess   i   m in favor of altern b   i   m still concern about inflationari pressur   i   m impress by tom hoenig   s argument on how power ethanol and other forc are in our societi  but i think that   s adequ reflect in the last section   that is  if thing chang and we had stronger econom data and  in my case  stronger verisimilitud  if not similitud  from the privat sector  then it leav the space to tighten becaus the last section is a balanc statement  i want to comment on what presid   and presid   point out about the second section   that   s the key point i   d like to dwell on   i think it   s wise to make a full stop after the word    quarter         still favor    impli doubt  and i don   t think that   s a wise thing for us to impli   second  we do repeat ourselv on hous   third  we can   t say with certainti that there is a gradual wane of the correct in the hous market  we don   t know   so  again  i would strong recommend that you have a full stop after the word    quarter      final  i will play my role of a broken record to suggest onc again that we insert the word    global    befor    resourc util    so that we don   t continu to further the belief that we are orient toward a close economi   those would be my recommend  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m okay leav the fed fund rate unchang today   i say that despit the fact that inflat read have been less favor late   core inflat is clear higher than we want   i see littl reason to expect moder any  soon without action on our part   if the truth about the forecast is that  as the  book say  we expect moder at the rate of   basi point a month or less  it would take a statistician quit a while to discern statist between that and no moder at all   concern about growth continu to keep us on the sidelin  and recent jitter about subprim mortgag and busi invest have ad to ongo concern sinc the last meet   these concern have given me the jitter as well both becaus i would prefer stronger growth to less and becaus at  e in the past such concern have deter need action on inflat   so to repeat  i   m okay leav the fed fund rate unchang   as i said  i do believ we will need to tighten this year to reduc inflat  but this  sn   t seem like a propiti  e to do so  with regard to the statement  i veri much agre with presid hoenig   i   m not sure i understand what the languag in section   is suppos to convey   on the one hand  it seem to retain and even strengthen our anti inflat tilt by label inflat our princip polici concern  on the other hand  the move to symmetr languag in the second sentenc would seem to remov a tighten bias   thus these sentenc seem to work in opposit direct   so more broad  i agre with presid hoenig   we should not be loosen the sens of our tighten bias in this statement   i also agre with presid     i   ll just regist agreement with his concern about the capac util languag   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i also general share the view of altern b and favor maintain the feder fund rate today   i thought what i   d do is just highlight a coupl of thing   first  i think the statement need to be reflect of the real economi rather than financi market  as we discuss ye day   so let me spend a moment on the refer to    still favor financi condit    in altern b   i think the financi condit are still favor  and so that   s an honest depict of event  as is the rest of the statement after the refer to come quarter   i think the question realli is  if we enter the debat over describ the financi condit  how do we get out of it   so when we meet next  i   m wonder how we   ll then describ the financi condit   or if we stop ani refer thereto  what is that say   that is  i think these market are adjust in a veri order way   i don   t feel now  as i fear a few week ago  that we would have to say and do thing to ensur that adjust occur   if we don   t refer to these financi condit and we continu to suggest that we think the economi will expand at a moder pace over the come quarter  that in itself show that we have some degre of comfort that the financi market tumult hasn   t realli chang our central tendenc   so though i   m comfort with the honest depict of all of altern b  i worri a bit about what our exit strategi is   i can   t come up with a better way in which to refer to financi condit without invit that discuss  and so i   m left with puzzlement about an exit strategi on that question  the most import thing that we   re accomplish in altern b is suggest that we aren   t go to come to the rescu of market tumult  that market disciplin is work  that we don   t want complac in the market  and that our job is not to make sure that peopl make money in those market   our job  as mani of you have said  is to keep the economi on an even keel   so with that  i favor altern b  but i will remain a littl uncomfort until someon can tell how we answer the question about what we do next regard the refer to still favor financi condit
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i  too  favor altern b   keep the feder fund rate constant at this point   from the discuss ye day  i gather that mani of us still see in some case a substanti risk that inflat just won   t come down from where it is   also  from the discuss ye day  i think that there is a bit more uncertainti   some fatter tail   and so modif to the statement that reflect that uncertainti are use  let me work from the bottom up and go from the risk assess in section     i like the risk assess   the remov of the explicit refer to firm will certain be interpret by the market as open the possibl of a cut down the line  which we hadn   t explicit open up befor   we do offset that a bit   i think     was get at this  although i think it is actual somewhat posit rather than negat   by character the committe   s inflat concern as    princip      a slight soften from    predomin    make sens to me becaus data have come in sinc the chairman enunci that    p    word  the    predomin    word    laughter      princip    is appropri reflect of the new inform and the way peopl have talk about it and give us a bit more flexibl down the line becaus the tail are somewhat fatter  which reflect the discuss   also  i take vinc   s present about         to heart  and so get a littl more flexibl there may not be a bad idea at this  e  on section    it   s import to acknowledg that the read have been a littl abov what most peopl are comfort with  and so i think it make sens to go with that languag   in section    some thing i like veri much  and some thing i don   t like   the phrase that the recent indic have been more mix and that the adjust in the hous sector is ongo are good way to character the discuss we had ye day and accur reflect of what   s go on in the economi   i like the phrase    the adjust in the hous sector is ongo     and i certain agre that the economi    seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace over come quarter     although in principl i would favor have a shorter section    just cut it off there  we might want to have at least a littl someth els   so i would say    support by  among other thing  gain in incom     and leav the word there   i   m actual quit strong oppos to includ    still favor financi condit    for some of the reason that have been enunci   that phrase will look like our veri weak attempt to say that we realli  realli do believ that the market are okay   that is  a weak attempt to talk up the market   when we use that phrase  we   re think about just the low bid ask spread and the capit that   s flow into the market   there   s a veri real chanc that the phrase will be misinterpret as focus on the equiti market  which i don   t think ani of us intend it to mean   also  governor     s concern is an import one   how do we get out of talk about the market   what if the market goe down   i don   t think it   s good for us to be use languag that we can   t explain our way out of   in a speech or in tes oni we could explain what we mean by    still favor financi market condit      but with the kind of crimp    kabuki    languag that we have in our statement  i think it would be much better to omit the refer   given that we have a veri good phrase about the ongo adjust in the hous sector in the first sentenc  i   m not sure what we accomplish by take away from it or give more color to what is a wane correct   be neutral becaus of uncertainti about that market   that it adjust is just ongo   is most appropri   so i would favor either cut thing off after    come quarter    or put in someth like    support by  among other thing  gain in incom      thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   vice chairman
do we have ani preced  vinc  for refer to financi condit describ as favor or otherwis   we   ve said that it   s support by accommod polici
i was go to say that most the refer would be to the stanc of polici  as oppos to financi condit
i think there was back in       after we cut rate  but i   m not sure   overal my concern about cut thing off after    quarter    or    gain in incom    is that such a statement would be kind of weak   we say that indic have been mix and adjust in the hous sector is ongo  but there   s an act of faith here   somehow not give some rational for the moder growth in incom ahead weaken the statement   the incom phrase alway struck me as endogen      we think that growth is go to be moder and that incom will go up with growth      but i can see the worri about the mention of financi condit   most peopl around the tabl mention that concern
you could do someth like    still  taken all togeth  the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace      i think that governor   was right on   in term of the short of this languag  highlight these three thing realli   run the risk that they will appear to be thing on which we are go to focus a lot of attent   we don   t want to convey  particular in the messag on financi condit  that that   s where we   re go to put our attent
let me just ask a question   the intent of this was not to comment on recent market volatil   the intent was to say that interest rate are low  stock price are pretti strong  and liquid is good  and that is go to support growth   would chang it to  say     aid by support financi condit    or someth like that  be of ani help
i fulli agre with governor     s idea that think that in this short form we can explain all of that is riski   given the volatil that we have recent seen and the concern  which mani have express  that this committe is out to save peopl from stock market problem  i just think that we run a risk by highlight    financi condit    in our statement right now
mr  chairman
i feel veri strong about this issu   i   d like to underscor the argument that have been made   i think we have unanim around this tabl   our job is to get the real economi right   we   re open a door here that entail signific risk   governor   made a veri good comment   what is our exit strategi onc we open that door   so the question is whether open that door is necessari   i don   t believ it   s necessari at this junctur
the way i would look at the issu is to suppos that we have anoth break in the stock market of   percent or   percent  someth like that   if we put    financi condit    now  we clear couldn   t put it in the next  e if we had that condit   then what would it mean for us to take it out   that   s whi  among the other thing that peopl have said  i would prefer not to have it in
okay   i get a general sens of agreement around the tabl  unless someon want to speak strong in favor of financi condit   presid  n
no  i don   t want to speak strong in favor of retain the refer to financi condit   but i do think  along the line that governor kohn express  that we need to provid some basi for our expect moder growth to continu   otherwis that sentenc   come across as an act of faith and  sn   t seem to me to be particular compel   i don   t see that mention financi condit   us ani damag  and it   s actual valuabl in provid some ration for that judgment   and that is the judgment
that was our object  and we   re tri to find short way to say it   anyon els   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i don   t have ani problem   i agre with cathi on the length  at the same  e  i don   t think focus on financi condit is a particular problem becaus what you   ve said about have that in there can be said about anyth els that you put in   what happen next  e if incom is lower and so forth   so i don   t think that    financi condit    in and of itself matter one way or the other   i also agre with governor kohn that we do need to have a rational   we can   t just take it on faith   we went down this road some  e ago  and this is what we have now  so i think we do owe peopl some explan  cathi
this whole statement is on faith  though    laughter   it reli on econom model and forecast and a ton more detail than we can ever express   we say that recent indic are mix   we say that the hous adjust is ongo   but if we take it all togeth  we still think the economi is like to expand   asid from write a treatis here  i don   t know what more we can say that we could all feel comfort with and not have to reconsid
i agre with that   if you look at what we said last  e  the onli refer to ani specif was to hous   if we stop the statement after the word    quarter     that   s exact what we   ll have this  e   now  i would make a minor suggest   the word    still    could be chang back to    overal    and just continu what we had last  e      overal  the economi seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace over come quarter      that word encompass that we   ve look at all of the inform and that   s our assess
the differ is that the first sentenc last  e was a posit sentenc   the first sentenc this  e is a negat sentenc
that   s whi i think the word    overal    would help
overal  howev       laughter
i thought about    howev     but prefer not to use that languag
all right   ani other two hand intervent   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   to get perspect on this  again  i go back to where i think we were in decemb   we   re realli not that much differ in our forecast from decemb  except that we have a littl more uncertainti   that mean that for the assess of risk i lean toward keep the same languag from the last meet and from the decemb meet  particular becaus of the issu that presid hoenig mention   that we need to indic that we are still veri vigil on inflat and that we   re worri about it   a further issu is that i think the chang will be seen as remov some of the bias  which will have a big impact on the market  that   s where i was befor the meet   howev  vinc has been veri convinc   mayb it   s his wonder vest    laughter   you might notic  vinc  that i tri to liven it up by wear a doubl breast suit   so we have a littl action go on here  differ from the usual    laughter  it   s realli the ghost of      that worri me   the argument that we could be in a situat in which we get a shock and need to have the flexibl to deal with it is actual veri import   in that case  i have concern along the line of presid hoenig   s  but i   m will to live with the new languag in altern b for the reason that you mention   becaus i think    predomin    has a littl stronger connot   not becaus of the dictionari but becaus it was use in the tes oni   i would stay with    predomin      it is just sort of an offset  and i would keep it on that level   in term of the big debat about what we do regard the rational  i think it is a tough call   i do not like mention financi market  as governor   said   then craft the languag is veri difficult   so i guess i end up with the kiss principl  which is    keep it simpl  stupid     and i would put a full stop after    quarter      thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m veri comfort with the center of graviti in this discuss   the boundari have shift just a bit  and we face a littl more uncertainti on the growth front   but i think there   s still asymmetri in the balanc of risk that we face  and we need to continu to highlight the risk that inflat may not moder enough   the probabl that we will tighten further has signific diminish  but i think our expect about what make sens for polici are still abov the market   s expect   i don   t think that situat mean that we need to tri to push the market   s expect up to our   by adjust the statement slight in the direct of neutral  we face the risk that we all acknowledg that the market will price in more eas than they alreadi have   but it is better to live with that risk than to preserv a formul that impli a probabl of further tighten that i don   t think is justifi  we need to give ourselv the flexibl now to move to neutral sooner than might have seem like   therefor  the broad outlin of altern b make sens to me  on section    as don said  the reason for put more textur about the basi for our forecast go forward was  in part  to counteract the fact that we   re sudden darker about the near term outlook   the absenc of ani textur on our forecast make the statement darker and convey more concern   so although i like minim and although a lot of sensibl thing have been said about the specif refer to financi condit and hous  i think there   s some valu in have more textur about the basi for our view   i   m not as troubl about the refer to financi condit as mani of you are   we could modifi the rational to say    support by incom gain  overal financi condit  and the gradual wane    so that the character of financi condit is implicit rather than explicit favor   but i don   t think that do so would go far in meet the concern express around the tabl   so i would be fine with the   formul  stop after    quarter      i think the rest of the word has it right  on    predomin    versus    princip     let me give just the follow argument   i don   t believ that a plain languag read of the two word justifi the conclus that    princip    will be read as softer than    predomin      peopl disagre  and in answer the question about what we expect to achiev by chang    predomin    to    princip     i   m not sure we   d win the basic argument that peopl would say     yeah  it   s softer      so  on the argument of consist  i would stay with    predomin      i don   t think our view of the risk on the inflat front have shift signific sinc the tes oni  and so i don   t have ani problem with maintain that   thank you  mr  chairman
if i could  i   d like to clarifi slight my earlier comment in the sens that i   m not of the view that the languag should stay in term of a bias toward tighten becaus i think we need to tighten   my view has been that we are modest firm and that we should be convey to the market that we are go to stay modest firm until we see a consist declin in the inflat number that we have   the difficulti is tri to explain that in languag   so what we end up with is a kind of hobson   s choic   we leav the languag as it has been  therefor signal that we will stay firm  or we chang the languag to say that we will be depend on the futur data   which is  i think  also accur   but make the chang tend to confirm the view that now we are more like to eas than we realli are   either way  we are give signal to the market that are not exact what we want to explain   so which of those do we choos in order to keep expect from chang too dramat   that   s realli my point as i   ve thought about this  which i want to clarifi   thank you
as i said in my discuss  obvious i   m veri concern about a refer to financi condit  especi    still favor financi condit      but as i also said  i think that it hang out there a bit nake without some color around it   i would be fine with keep person incom gain and the gradual wane correct to the hous market   my prefer would be just someth like    incom gain  among other factor    to put someth there   but that may be so weak that it may be better to cut off   i   m sympathet to have some color  but i think the wrong color is the financi market condit
governor kohn has suggest    support by gain in incom and the anticip gradual wane in the correct of the hous market
that would be excel
mr  chairman
that word has the virtu of be true in that it is the basi for the central forecast
an addit advantag    laughter
it is what we think   the problem with it is that  as don said  the refer to gain in incom itself is empti  and put so much emphasi on hous as part of our forecast for growth be basic fine go forward is a littl awkward   my view is the corner solut are more attract than the intermedi  and they are either some modifi version of what we have now or a return to minim with a stop after    quarter
yes   i   m realli sympathet to randi   s view about financi condit  i   m sympathet about    financi condit    becaus i think there   s real potenti for confus in market about how the phrase relat to polici and whether we might eas if thing got too chaotic or volatil   but i agre with presid  n that a littl more textur on what we   re do is fine   i share governor kohn   s view that appeal to endogen variabl as if they   re an exogen caus for belief in support is a littl confus  but in the context i think the refer would be taken to signal that we expect consumpt growth to support the expans   i just want to regist that
thank you   has everyon spoken   well    laughter   let me tri to find a consensus here   first  i agre with the sen ent around the tabl   i recommend no action today   we should continu to emphas inflat risk   i think there   s a strong feel that it remain the greater risk   there is acknowledg that uncertainti and risk have increas on both side of the dual mandat  but the balanc of risk   not seem to have chang veri much  support the idea of keep the rate where it is is that  as best we can tell  the level of the rate current seem about right to fo  our object   also as peopl have note  by stand pat  we have consider abil to tighten de facto as market expect move toward our actual reveal behavior   so i would counsel patienc on the rate and maintain the rate at it current level today  let me take a stab at the statement   i think we all agre on section      laughter   on section    let me note the suggest of  i think it was presid  n   i   m sympathet   i didn   t hear much support  howev  and again  it   s a chang   so i would recommend that we stay with the current section    on section    first a small point   i think the mild prefer was for    predomin    over    princip    as consist with my tes oni   to the extent that we   re tri to lean against eas of expect  if    predomin    is slight stronger  it would be benefici in that respect   so let me propos that chang   i recogn the risk that the second sentenc in section   has the potenti to mislead the market a bit   my concern is that the second sentenc that we have been use is simpli not liter true anymor   the implic is that we are certain that the next move is go to be an increas  and it   s onli a matter of when and how much   we have been tri for some  e to get out of that languag and to get to someth that is more descript   the benefit of the second sentenc are  first  that it   creat more flexibl and  second  that it refer onli to thing on the right hand side of the taylor rule   that is  inflat and output   and  sn   t make a statement about futur polici action  which most peopl seem to prefer avoid whenev possibl   again  although it will be view as a small step toward balanc or flexibl  we are fair strong in our statement of inflat risk   in particular  we   ve introduc here not just that we think there are inflat risk but that our specif concern is that inflat will not moder  which is a differ and somewhat stronger statement than we have had   i acknowledg that there may be some market ralli base on this  but with presid pool  i think that the data will domin as we go forward   inde  the endogen of interest rate and their stabil effect are veri import asset that we have in polici  with respect to the descript in section    the intent was  given that the first sentenc is relat negat  to give some modest rational for our think that the economi seem like to continu expand   let me tri one more suggest   perhap we can find a solut   one reason that a quick summari is difficult is that the stori for recoveri is  in fact  fair complic   it involv certain the end of the hous correct but also assumpt of inventori correct  of invest come back at a moder pace  and of a number of other thing   the notion here was to look at more fundament factor that would be under the assumpt of growth  such as incom  which has grown rapid  and support financi condit   but i hear the concern  the  book forecast call for moder growth in essenti all of the compon except for hous   in particular  it expect consumpt to grow more than   percent  invest  more than   percent  support from govern spend and net export  and so on   so someth along the line of    support by growth in nonhous compon of final demand    might be a descript way of say that we think that  although hous will be a drag  the other compon of the economi will support moder growth   that   s a suggest
could you repeat the sentenc
the last phrase would be    support by growth in nonhous compon of final demand
yes  governor
i   m a littl worri about that becaus there   s been such a big deal made about the hous market and the media have been make a big deal that it   s go to collaps   we mention in the first sentenc that it has gotten weaker  and if there   s no counter to that  which is part of the view that we think there   s some stabil of demand  i would worri   so  i worri a littl that by say    nonhous    we don   t have enough of a counter to the first sentenc   when i first read this  one reaction i had was to follow the kiss principl  but that worri me a bit becaus we chang from the previous statement in which we said we had a problem in hous   then it was all right becaus then we came back and said     yes  but we think it   s go to work out okay in the end      so there   s a littl tension here that worri me about say    nonhous     which may spook the market a bit
i would also point out that  peopl may read    economi    as be gdp   if you take hous out  the rest of it is gdp   the way you state it is a bit of a tautolog   i think the simplest thing is just to chang    still    to    nevertheless         nevertheless  the economi seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace     and just leav it at that
okay   i think that   s where we   re head   vinc
first  i   d like to thank everyon for valid my own career decis   laughter   second  in your descript you use the word    fundament     which might be a substitut for    financi condit      you could say    support by still favor fundament  includ gain in incom and the wane of the correct in the hous market
that is similar to what governor kohn suggest   i got the sens at the  e that it wasn   t well receiv   all right  i think we   re not go to come to a conclus   so i think we need to accept presid     s suggest   was there other comment   start with    nevertheless    might be better      nevertheless  the economi seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace over come quarter      okay   presid
just a moment   i think i   m fine with that   i like your suggest for chang it that way   this speak volum about our next topic of discuss of communic and how we convey more about what we think rather than be confin to the structur of this statement   i   d also like to pick up on anoth comment that you made   i spoke befor presid  n  but i think that presid  n   s suggest to replac sentenc   in section   with sentenc   in section   of altern c would be a big improv   sinc you allud to that suggest and said that nobodi came to support it  i just want to add my support to that suggest
are there other who would like to make that chang  sever   i support that  other   no  i      laughter
consider uncertainti has surround our forecast of inflat for some  e   that   s how we refer to the fact that there are inflat risk   we have now chang the character of the statement to acknowledg the fact that the recent read have been somewhat elev   that implicit acknowledg that there   s some uncertainti to our forecast   i don   t think it   s a justifi chang   i don   t think there is substanti increas in our uncertainti about the inflat forecast today versus januari or even decemb
let me ask your indulg on leav it the way it is this  e and think about it more care for the next meet   are there ani other comment  should i read it    laughter
i   ll take a stab at it
you   ll take a stab   all right

thank you   michell  could you work with   to get a yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes           print version of the statement that we   ll circul after the break so everybodi can at least familiar themselv with what we   re say here today    laughter   all right   whi don   t we take a coffe break for fifteen minut   thank you   coffe break
whi don   t we recomm   governor kohn
i   m read the statement    laughter   but it didn   t take long    laughter  i think   has redistribut the list of question that came from the memo that   sent around     there have been slight rewrit of question   and    but the idea is basic the same     the list of question to which mr  kohn refer is append to this transcript  appendix     i want to start by thank the staff for all the background memo   i thought they were particular clear and help   we are not go to have staff brief this morn  in part becaus they did such a good job on the memo that i didn   t think we realli need to follow up with brief this morn   but thank you all veri much  we have two item on the agenda   the numer specif of price stabil and the trial run on the forecast and the forecast narrat   on the price stabil object  you have the question in front of you   onc we finish the discuss  the subcommitte will compil the result  tri to ascertain where we are and what the center of graviti would be  and consid what the next step might be  depend on what peopl say   on the trial run  i don   t anticip an extend discuss   if peopl have major issu and question to rais  they should rais them  but much of the idea of the trial run is to uncov major issu and question  so i hope that the discuss can be relat short   that   s all i have to say by way of introduct  mr  chairman
thank you   i   d like to make a coupl of prefatori remark  some of the issu here are polit in natur  so i   d like you to know that i have consult a bit with the congress   i did not go to negoti  i went to inform  and therefor i don   t have ani commit to bring to you   but i was general pretti encourag by my discuss   i had the sens that   and this is a veri import caveat   so long as our commit to the dual mandat remain strong both in word and in deed  we will get a fair hear if we decid to go forward   i also have a veri strong impress that the risk of go into direct that we don   t want in term of open up the feder reserv act and so on is quit low and can be manag  so we should think about this today on it merit   if we decid to go forward  we   ll have to develop a strategi  but i don   t think that there are immedi barrier from the polit side to prevent us from consid this  that be said  i just want to say also that we have not decid that we are go to agre on an object   there are various possibl   we could agre on an object   we could agre to agre but to do it in a stage and gradual way   or we could simpli not agre on an object   even so  i think that the discuss today would be quit help for our intern discuss becaus i   m not the onli one who feel that a certain amount of disagr exist around the tabl that may be associ with view on what inflat should be and how we should measur it   again  we have not made ani decis  and i hope today will give us some more insight about how much consensus we have  just a word on the project   as was note  i think that a minut style process could be a use way to make sure that everybodi has seen the document   but i want just to make clear that  if we do these project  twice a year the project  the commentari  and so forth will have to appear in the monetari polici report to the presid  which is about two week after the meet   therefor  we will have to work toward ensur that we can do this in about a two week period  or a littl less than the usual period for the minut   i just want to make that clear  final  i think we   re in pretti good shape on  e  but we   re respond to sever request   we are go to tri veri  veri hard to be finish by      p m   so i hope everyon will keep that in mind as we go through the discuss   the discuss is open for comment on the question that the committe rais   presid pool
well  let me just go bing  bing  bing  bing   i think it probabl make sens  mr  chairman  to take up these two topic separ  so let me start on the price object  my answer to question   is    yes      i think the object should be defin numer   i believ that the core pce is the right index   mani of us have talk about that  and we sort of coalesc around that measur   i would like to see the goal state as     percent  plus or minus      to me  it make sens to have a central point there  but you have to have a rang   i would like the goal to be state as in the medium term   ordinarili that might mean someth like two year  but under certain circumst  it has to be longer becaus  if you had a septemb    type of event  you would want to make sure that you were not drive the economi in the wrong direct by go after the inflat goal in too rigid a fashion   i think there should be a consensus view of the committe   question     in answer to question    i think it would be extrem awkward if we had separ view made public   the question would be  whi   pool differ from bernank   or if bernank didn   t answer  what is bernank   s view   i think we   d just get ourselv into a peck of troubl if we tri to do this freestyl   if we   re go to do this  i think we realli need to have a committe decis   thank you
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  i   ve given this a lot of thought   if you rememb  in the last round i ask for a compel argument for adopt a state specif inflat target   i note that it was not at all obvious that the countri that have adopt a specif inflat target have done better than we have in term of econom perform over the past decad or  for that matter  better than countri that have not adopt a target   one could make the counterargu that it   s not at all obvious that countri that have adopt numer definit have done wors than we have   i understand and respect tremend the theoret argument that can be made to valid adopt of a numer inflat object   howev  to my mind our vulner is not with economist or even with what we use to call the    quant jock    on wall street   our vulner is with those to whom we are account   the peopl and the repres of the peopl   also  i   m not convinc that a numer target is necessari at this stage  i do note that other have done this   i rais four children   one of my first instruct to my children was     just becaus everybodi els is do it  sn   t mean you have to do it     i   m mind of that today    laughter   i   m mind of the fact that other countri have adopt this for differ reason   we know about the u k    s    great moder      i understand the use of a numer target in term of the ecb  given the complex of mani countri  non uniform data  and a popul base that keep chang   i understand that the bank of japan had been so total discredit that it was necessari to adopt such a target   i understand that the new zealand govern was so grossli incompet that they had no choic but to adopt a target   i consid other countri a bit too small to be persuas   we talk about one of them last  e  so my real issu is that i can   t find a compel case for or against  but i   m not of the natur that i like to join the crowd for the sake of join the crowd  i don   t think it is a suffici reason   and i can say this becaus i am the least academ prepar at this tabl   to do so at this  e for the puriti of what are veri respect theoret argument   i   m mind of the polit   you and i have talk about this person  mr  chairman   i am grate for the comment that you made at the begin of this discuss   let me just state parenthet that barney frank is one of the smartest men i know   he would actual understand that the word    stochast    deriv from the greek    stochasticus     which mean    skill in aim     and he probabl know more than ani other congressman about this subject  even though he has drawn what appear to be a line in the sand  but that   s not what i   m worri about   i am worri about whether or not we   ve accumul suffici polit capit to sell this to the rest of the congress and to the repres of the peopl  and i   m a littl concern about the  e of our do so   we spent the past two day talk about downsid risk to the economi   some of us feel  as i state in our earlier discuss  that we may be just a revis away or perhap a shock away from some econom turbul  some econom weak  and perhap a recess   i wonder about the optic  mr  chairman  of our dwell on this subject at this  e  given that there  sn   t seem to be a compel need becaus we don   t have the same condit that the unit kingdom  the ecb  the bank of japan  new zealand  and other face  have said that   and i   m go to just shoot everyth at onc and then i   ll be done   i think it is implicit in question number   that we are go to adopt this  which i am not in favor of   but if i had a gun put to my head and someon said     you must adopt this   what is your prefer index     i would say  be someon who has an m b a  and not a ph d   that  first  it is import that we adopt whatev target we adopt such that businessmen  businesswomen  financi  and other econom agent do not need to take inflat into consider in their decisionmak   second  it must be polit palat and credibl and easi to understand  ordinarili i would argu  if it weren   t for those two condit  for what we love in dalla  which is the trim mean  but that is way too complic to explain to the public   but i would also argu against the pce exclud energi and food   i would argu for adopt the cpi   i would argu for a   percent target over a three year to five year period   over  e they all converg at ani rate   by the way  as far as i   m concern  if my math is still correct    percent mean that price doubl everi    year  which is a reason life   and given the    percentag point measur bias  that might actual mean they doubl everi     year  which is about as much as i would like to see   so i would argu for a   percent target base on the cpi   if you put a gun to my head  which i hope you don   t   over a longer  e frame  as far as committe particip arriv at a consensus view on this goal  i don   t think consensus is essenti   in fact  you could have the committe report a central tendenc or some rang   i   m not go to get into question       and     i want to go to the forecast narrat  which concern me   as we   ve talk about befor  i   m not in favor of full frontal view   i took note of governor     s comment about    kabuki    earlier  i think it   s good to preserv a littl kabuki   if we are go to communic with the public  we need to communic in understand languag   i don   t wish to give offens  but i know i will   i would not be in favor of the staff draft that statement   i would be in favor of write it in the simplest possibl languag   i suggest  mr  chairman  that it would be more appropri for  say  our communic staff or michell or somebodi like that to draft this statement so that we communic to the public in a way that is comprehens   i was taken aback at even the use of the word    stochast    at the end   we know what that mean   the peopl have no idea what    stochast    mean   again  i return to my root question   with whom are we tri to communic   we talk about the market   the market are what   economist  theoret economist  econometrician  ourselv  peopl on wall street  sophist oper of financi market  businesswomen and businessmen  or the public in general   my greatest fear is do anyth that would impugn the integr or threaten the preserv of this institut  and so i want to plead with you and with the rest of the peopl around this tabl       to consid whether we realli need to adopt an inflat target at this  e and     should we do so  to make it as simpl and comprehens and easili communic as possibl and to do so in the same way with the forecast that we are discuss the possibl of issu   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   it won   t surpris anyon that i believ the committe should adopt a numer object for inflat for reason that we have discuss at great length over the past sever meet   name  to clarifi our intern deliber  to clarifi the public   s understand of our object  and to enhanc our account for achiev those object   i just do not see how ani use purpos is serv by retain the discret to vari our object from medium term and longer term inflat trend  follow     s outlin  i believ our object should be state in term of the broadest avail measur of the purchas power of money   the best measur we have of the true consumpt valu of the dollar is the price index for person consumpt expenditur   i believ that the overal index would be prefer to the core as an object   i know i   ve argu in the past for focus on core pce  but on reconsider  i   ve chang my mind   the various argument for exclud food and energi are narrow  they   re somewhat technic  and they   re difficult to explain to the public   i should know  i   ve tri    laughter   the argument are incomplet as well in the sens of the rang of consider that one has regard choos the inflat rate   onli some of them tell you to stabil the core inflat rate   reduc uncertainti about the rate of return on the purchas power of money suggest a broader index and one that is much easier for the public to understand   moreov  i don   t think argument for the core  the way it is construct now  are like to be robust to structur chang in the economi  shift in what price are sticki  what price are not  what are market determin and what not  and stochast properti of various compon of inflat   grant  the overal index is more variabl than the core right now  but fluctuat in the overal index are more transitori than the core as well   we   re natur go to factor that variabl into our forecast  our action  and our communic   in explain the transitori influenc on the overal index  we can easili refer to the core  if that make sens  as aid our judgment about where the overal index is go to go   the fact that various payment program like social secur are index to the cpi is  in my mind  of no consequ for this choic   if we target the pce price index  it will natur rise in promin over  e   no matter which index we use to stabil  peopl with incom index to the cpi are go to be expos to the risk associ with the measur error in the cpi   it  sn   t matter what we target  they still bear that risk  although i and other have discuss a rang of comfort zone in the past  i   m uncomfort with the ambigu of present onli a target rang for inflat   when inflat is abov the target rang  for exampl  the public would be unclear about whether we intend to bring inflat back to the center of the zone or whether get just insid the top of the rang would constitut success in our eye   i think it make most sens to specifi our object as a singl number but also to provid a rang around the object within which we would general expect inflat to remain and to provid a sens of how close to our object we expect to be on averag  that would help enhanc our account  what number should we choos as an object   our inflat mandat specifi price stabil   the bias in our measur of inflat impli that price stabil correspond to someth a bit below   percent for the overal pce right now   the main consider usual advanc for choos a number appreci abov price stabil is the notion of build in a buffer to reduc the probabl of encount the zero lower bound on nomin interest rate  there seem to be substanti popular confus about the zero bound and it implic for monetari polici   but i agre with you  mr  chairman  that we have all the tool necessari to deal with this problem   now  grant  the effect of some of those tool would depend critic on communic credibl to the public  so the zero bound might present us with some uniqu communic challeng  should we encount it   i can imagin give such potenti challeng some small weight in choos a target valu  but i emphas small becaus  as i said  i believ we would have all the tool we need at our dispos  and we ought to be abl to communic that fact  take all of this on board  i believ   percent would be our best choic for a numer inflat object   i believ     percent would be toler close to price stabil  but i view   percent as incompat with our price stabil mandat   should we adopt an object abov   percent  howev  we should not emphas the zero bound becaus do so would onli reinforc the public   s sens of anxieti should the situat ever aris   i think we should provid the guidanc that we expect overal inflat to general remain within plus or minus   percent of our object   we should view our choic of object as close to perman   this is import   that is  we should be extrem reluct to alter our numer target   we are invit peopl to make long run plan on the basi of our commit  and they should be abl to count on us over the long haul  a corollari of view our choic as perman is that we should not place ani weight at all on current initi condit and the associ transit cost when choos what to target  a univers properti of monetari model  and mani other model as well  is that initi condit have no bear on the long run inflat rate under op  polici   it  sn   t matter where you start  you get to the same op  inflat rate in the end   furthermor  choos a target closer than otherwis to where we are now in an effort to avoid transit cost would delay and dilut the contribut to our credibl   delay becaus eventu the inflat rate will chang and we will need to take action to return inflat to target  and dilut becaus choos a target to match current inflat will encourag the public to believ that if inflat drift away we might chang the target again to avoid short run transit cost   after all  a fear of transit cost is exact what discourag us from take suffici action to stem inflat befor        moreov  the staff memo by reifschneid and tetlow show how the transit cost can be minim if we success communic our intent  question   is  what   s the  e horizon by which the goal should typic be achiev   that is  how long would we expect it to take to get to the target at ani point in  e and from ani state of the world   well  this may vari   i believ that most of the  e we should be abl to conduct polici so that inflat is expect to return to the object within two year  assum that the public understand how we are conduct polici   an import consider here is that the credibl of an object will depend on the public   s abil to assess our adher to it   the longer the  e that we allow for expect return to target  the more often shock will interfer and the public   s infer problem will be that much harder  question   has been reword   should the committe particip joint decid on it goal  either through a formal vote or an inform consensus   you know  if that mean strive for broad agreement  yes   if that mean an individu particip should be abl to veto an agreement  my answer is no  especi if it   s presid      laughter   question   is  should particip    view be made public in the minut   i guess this question has been reword  too   how should the public be inform   if i   m read this correct  it refer to how the various view of particip that are express dure deliber on establish a numer object be reveal or not   i see no reason that dissent view should not be faith reflect in the minut   but i   m assum that  onc a decis is made  particip are go to accept the agre upon goal as the committe   s object and the basi for policymak  regard the trial run  i support do one in may   i onli have a coupl of minor comment   the first is that i would take the instruct to base project on    an appropri path of monetari polici    to mean an appropri reaction function becaus i think condit on a fix   e invari path for the polici rate  sn   t make much sens and make it harder to explain what the fan chart are all about   i would also note that the way in which the simul under the confid interv in the fan chart are present  at least as i interpret them  did not appear to captur paramet uncertainti   perhap other sourc of uncertainti as well are omit   we should strive to construct those so that they do convey all the sourc of uncertainti that we   re capabl of incorpor  so they should be comprehens in that regard   that conclud my remark   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
first of all  i realli want to congratul the staff on the document they produc   when i was think about how they might be written  i would have had a hard  e figur out how to make sens out of all of this   it was realli extrem well done  and so you realli deserv congratul on this   one thing i find  by the way  in talk to staff member is their incred profession   when you ask them to do someth that   s realli hard to do but import  they love do it   that profession show in this case  let me go down the list of question   obvious  i don   t think my answer to number   will be a huge surpris    laughter   some interest discuss would be creat if it were differ  but clear i believ that have a numer price object is import   the reason are the one i   ve discuss befor   veri briefli  i think it clarifi communic with the public  the market  and the politician   it increas transpar and account  which i think is a key issu for central bank   also  a numer object would actual improv the clariti  and has improv the clariti  of discuss about monetari polici insid central bank  i think it would help in this context in the fomc as well   the reason i think it would is that it would lead more natur to discuss about polici in term of appropri inflat path  that is the way that modern monetari polici analysi indic is appropri for us to think about how we do our polici   it actual is an element now of the way we discuss polici  but i think a numer price object would make the discuss even clearer   if we were have such discuss insid  at some point the numer object would have to go outsid   there   s an issu about transpar here   if we   re go to clarifi how we make polici insid and we   re not tell the public how we   re do it  at some point it will leak out   then we look foolish or as though we have not been transpar  which i think is also a problem  so there alway are issu   the devil is in the detail  and that   s realli what the question are deal with   i like to think about the principl by which i deal with the rest of the question   a numer inflat object has to have three import featur   first  the object need to be absolut and clear consist with the dual mandat   that   s also veri import polit  but i strong believ in the dual mandat  and so we have to make sure that that   s the case   financi stabil concern  though you might consid them somewhat separ  are part of the dual mandat and  as such  are clear key to how we do this   second  the object has to be easi to communic clear to the public  which is someth that presid   point out   third  the object need to be evolutionari becaus we want to build on our success and becaus it would be polit more palat   all three of these featur  by the way  are actual veri import in term of the polit process  in term of talk to the public about how we are conduct polici  and in term of help them have confid in it  regard the question  i want to start with question    becaus i think that question   the issu of the appropri  e horizon   is critic to think about all the other question  the first part of the question is to ask what kind of thing might affect the  e horizon   the realiti is that the  e horizon can have a lot of variabl   the scienc of monetari polici  or the econom that we have learn over the year in term of the best way to do monetari polici  say that  in fact  your horizon is go to chang depend on how far away from your ul  goal you are current  what kind of shock you   ve had  whether the shock are temporari or perman  how big the output gap that you project are  and then  clear  what the financi stabil issu are   if you get shock to the financi market  you have to worri about them   so my think is that the minimum  e horizon is go to be two year becaus that   s effect the polici period   but the horizon could be substanti longer than that  and i think this is extrem import in the design becaus it has a big impact on the issu of the dual mandat   i think it   s absolut critic that we make it clear that the horizon would some  have to be quit long   in fact  from a polit viewpoint do so is extrem import becaus by indic that the horizon could be some  quit long we are actual indic that we care about output fluctuat  which is a key element of the dual mandat   polit it is also import becaus it make it clear that we would be unwil to beat the economi over the head with a basebal bat in order to get inflat down quick   again  that indic that we do care about output fluctuat   so i lean toward not be too precis about the horizon but  instead  indic that the object to be achiev in the long run are sort of on averag over the busi cycl   the chairman use languag like this in a speech in st  loui in       and i was veri comfort with that languag  let me deal with the other issu  some of which i don   t have strong view on  but i can give you the differ side   on the issu of the price index  i realli don   t have strong view  it   s realli six of one and half a dozen of the other   i lean slight toward the cpi becaus it is more readili understood by the public   it   s what is report everi month   it might even have an advantag in that it is never revis   the r s document actual chang my view on this becaus i think you are quit right that from a polici viewpoint it  sn   t realli matter   but there is the issu that when a revis occur and is  for exampl  upward  it may look as though you didn   t do a good job when in fact  with the inform you had  you did the best job possibl   so the lack of revis has a bit of polit advantag  although not an advantag from the view of actual do polici   i think you   re quit right in that regard   what is the advantag of the pce index   it has the advantag of continu  so it fit the evolutionari element that i talk about   it also has slight advantag on a technic basi  howev  they   re not as big as they use to be   when the fed went to the pce instead of the cpi in talk about the inflat number at which it was look  do so then was more necessari than it would be now   the bottom line here is that i   m will to go with whatev other peopl are will to go with on this  but i have a slight prefer for the cpi  what about headlin versus core   i have problem with a core measur from the follow viewpoint   there is realli no one right measur of the core  and theori can chang in tell us what it should be   also  regard the issu of whether the core has the more perman trend element  let me give a case as an exampl in which that might be shift  usual we think of food price as veri temporari becaus they have to do with drought  anchovi leav the coast of brazil  or someth like that   but think about the case of ethanol right now   there   s a push for ethanol product   i have to tell you  i think that is a veri bad piec of public polici   howev  it could have perman effect   i   m sorri  tom  it   s go to help your district
no  it won   t    laughter
i don   t think it   s a good idea   it may have much more perman consequ for food price   then  should you necessarili exclud food from the core when  in fact  it   s more of a perman shock   in that case  i think there are issu   anoth critic issu relat to the horizon   if you think that the horizon should be long or not precis defin  then the differ between core and headlin becom much less import becaus  in the long run  the number that you should shoot for in the core will be the same as shoot for that number in the headlin   in this context  it make sens to use a headlin measur  not a core measur  howev  for polici discuss we will need to continu to refer to the core  particular in regard to shock such as the recent episod with energi   in fact  other central bank have success done so   i think the intern financ document talk a lot about canada and how they   ve done it exact this way  on question    point goal or rang  again the  e horizon is critic   if you have a fix period for evalu  there is no question to me that a rang make a lot of sens   it nice show that you care about uncertainti   i recent wrote an academ paper that show that a rang has veri nice properti in term of the appropri object function that you get and the behavior of a central bank  becaus it   s clear that you   d be shoot for the midpoint and then there   s some uncertainti around it   the problem is that  if you take my view that the horizon should be potenti long or not fix  then talk about a rang creat confus   a rang then look like a zone of indiffer   so if we took a number such as   to   as our comfort zone or rang  would     be okay relat to       as the purpos of talk about a numer inflat object is clariti  i think that a rang would be a mistak   it also could mean that inflat expect would be less ground   when inflat goe up to     versus      peopl might move up their inflat expect up   again  we would be lose one of the key benefit of have a numer inflat object   one thing that was not in the if document   and they shouldn   t have put it in becaus it   s a privat communic  but i can   is the issu of australia   australia is one of the countri that have a    comfort zone    rang   they call it a thick point  and they talk about a number over the cycl   it hasn   t been a disast  so it is not a huge deal   but offici there said     you know  if we had start this process a littl differ      they had to convinc their governor  who was not particular enthusiast initi about inflat target and so use a thick point      it would have been better if we had just pick a number      so i think they have some discomfort   my research is not scientif   it come from sit and have a beer with them in the pub   but i think their experi argu for a point target  what about the issu of level   again  this is veri import   i have to point out that my perspect reflect my view on the way the economi work and the way expect work   i strong believ that just announc an object will not substanti chang inflat expect   the chairman and i particip in write a book on this topic   we look at the adopt of inflat target by mani countri  and the evid was that it did not chang inflat expect immedi   in fact  expect were anchor over  e through action and through have inflat target  which was a huge benefit   again  the memo by reifschneid and tetlow on op  control exercis was realli terrif   a beauti memo   i thought it was just realli first rate   when i look at it  i was veri comfort with the character of learn from polici action   i do not accept the standard view in past bluebook that it take ten year to get down there  which is base on what happen to inflat in the past and then get incorpor into expect   i think expect can move fa  than that  but the way you do it is by action as well as by word   you have to bring out the basebal bat a bit  which indic that there is some substanti cost to do so   you saw that in the simul  my view is that there are substanti cost to move inflat expect down from the current level of around   percent   also  from read the memo and from read the literatur  i don   t see a big differ in term of econom effici between a   percent steadi state inflat rate and a     percent steadi state inflat rate   so i realli do disagre strong with you  presid    on this issu   i think transit cost matter   they should be part of our calcul   when i includ the transit cost and my view that there   s not a huge differ from a welfar standpoint in term of     versus   percent  i   m comfort with   percent  let me state one other advantag and then go to what worri me   there is an import polit issu here   to me  what   s realli import is to anchor inflat expect  and i   ll do anyth to get there   the actual number is less import so long as it is a reason number  consist with the  span definit of price stabil   that is  it   s sort of like pornographi  you know it when you see it   a number of   is certain consist with that   but choos a level at the upper end of what peopl have talk about in the comfort zone will help allay politician    fear that we   re inflat nutter   it will also help allevi the fear that we are insuffici concern about the second element of the dual mandat and will suggest that we do care about output fluctuat   i worri a bit that  if we had an object of     percent  we could get into the follow bind   to be serious about get there  which would be critic becaus otherwis we   d lose our credibl  we would need to rais the feder fund rate from current level  as the simul indic  to convinc peopl of our serious and that would help bring inflat expect down   i worri that do so would make the polit environ veri hostil  and we could lose support for a numer inflat object   that would be veri cost   and could weaken the support for our independ   that   s the reason i tend to be driven to the   percent number  let me tell you about the one downsid that i think is serious and that we have to think about   there is a downsid to a   percent pce object  or a cpi equival  appropri adjust    the downsid is that we may get the opposit of the automat stabil that was talk about in the r s document in the context of price level target   i   m go to use an allus that dave   mention  which i thought was great   it just show that dave is watch too mani cartoon   choos the   percent number has someth of the flavor of shoot an arrow and then paint the bull eye around the arrow  it seem to have an element of opportun to it   here   s the problem with that kind of opportun   it can creat veri bad expect dynam  just the opposit of the benefit of the price level target   say in the futur you chose a number   if peopl think that you might chang it again when you overshoot the object  then inflat expect would rise becaus they think you   re go to rais the object   that would then caus inflat to rise more than it otherwis would  and you would get more output fluctuat   so it has sort of the opposit of the benefit that were discuss  the result is that you could actual do much wors in term of achiev the dual mandat   you could do wors both on inflat and on output fluctuat  which is someth that we don   t want to do   i   m not sure how big a problem this is if we communic care the perman of the number   here i agre strong with presid   that it   s veri import not to chang the number unless there are veri strong scientif reason to do so   the if memo help me here  too  in point out that mani countri chose a number base on where they were   they actual shot the arrow and then paint the target around it  and it did not creat a huge problem in term of commit   norway is an exampl that come to mind  and i know a similar issu came up for sweden as well  let me quick finish with question       and     i   ve thought about this a lot more  and now i want to take back someth i said at the first meet in which i particip   was it octob   this goe to show that i don   t think consist is alway necessari  it has benefit  but some  you do need to chang your mind   i think it would be a veri bad idea to take a survey of the particip on the object or publish the particip    view in the minut   my view has to do with the opportun issu   do so would make it much more like that the inflat object could chang from year to year   that realli   worri me becaus it would make a commit to the inflat object harder  and we would get the bad expect dynam  which could be problemat   so as i said  i think that we need to come to a consensus and make it clear that the object will chang onli if there is a good scientif reason for do so   that is  a chang in our view  say  on measur error  or someth along those line  i realli don   t have much to say about the issu of a trial run   a trial run for produc a forecast narrat is a veri good idea   i want to mention that have a forecast narrat might chang the  e in term of the minut not just twice a year becaus i would advoc that we do this four  e a year   veri like it could be part of a monetari polici report  which is someth that i would advoc   that report would have to be issu  and then the congress might want to set up tes oni about it  and the likelihood is that they would want it to be befor the minut to get maximum attent for the hear   we saw this occurr in sweden  for exampl  and i would suspect that it would be true here   in that context  i think that we would more like have to do the discuss of the forecast among us a littl quicker than the minut  and we should just be awar of that   thank you veri much
mr  chairman
yes   presid
i   d like to respect just ask a question
to tri to clarifi your view  governor     if inflat were now   percent and we began conduct op  polici  do you think the inflat rate under that op  polici from now on   ten or twenti year from now   would be   percent
no  definit not   again  you have to take into account the welfar consider of the steadi state  which are extrem import   my view is that ani number between     and     is reason   i tend to be a littl more reluct about   becaus i do worri more about the lower bound problem   i also worri a bit about the issu of potenti deflationari effect on balanc sheet  so my number tend to be a littl higher than your number in the steadi state   number abov   are not sustain  and they would have veri negat welfar consequ   i   m will to choos   becaus  when i assess the literatur and ask whether there is a differ in term of the steadi state and in term of the welfar benefit from   percent versus      i just can   t find it   then the transit cost becom an issu  as do the polit consider   that is whi we come to somewhat differ view   at   percent  i would be advoc our bring out the basebal bat  i would agre that we would have to rais rate a lot to convinc the market   in fact  this is what volcker had to do  and he was a great feder reserv chairman   luckili  we   re not in that situat right now
so your view about the steadi state op  inflat rate is what
i   m indiffer between     and     howev  that  sn   t mean that i have a zone of indiffer about choos a number   i think you have to pick a number   the expert in monetari econom might have a prefer   but if after read the literatur you ask them whether they thought there was much differ between     and    i would be extrem shock if they said    yes
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to thank the staff for realli a great piec of work and a lot of coordin  which made this possibl   first  i want to say at the outset that i do not want to move forward at this point in provid a numer definit of the committe   s inflat object   second  regard the enhanc use of a survey of econom project  i support the releas of increas inform on the econom outlook along the line suggest in the memo   to be a littl more specif  i would like to assur everyon that i believ it is import to maintain a clear commit to price stabil   that   s not what i   ve been disagre with at all  howev  in look at the benefit and cost of adopt a numer inflat object  i believ the practic benefit are relat small at this  e and the cost are relat larger than the benefit   therefor  i suggest that we not do it   regard the benefit  there appear to be littl differ in econom perform of inflat target and non inflat target countri that we are look at   also  i have not seen convinc evid that inflat expect are better anchor with an explicit numer object than with our current method of communic and act toward an environ of stabl price or at least low inflat   in contrast  i think the cost at this  e are a littl higher   the polit implic are import   i think about the law of unintend consequ or some of the longer term reaction   and not just those of the congress but also the public more general   we have a commit to a dual mandat   if we also have a commit to a specif price target  i think that over  e the argument will mount   and i would understand them mount   that we need a specif target for output   then we   re go to get ourselv tri to balanc this out  and frank i think it will be difficult   so that is whi i   m veri reluct to have a numer target put forward when we have a dual mandat that suggest otherwis in term of balanc  now  if we do go forward  where do i come out in term of the numer object   i would go with both a core pce and a core cpi   despit the general superior of the pce  and ignor the difficulti in price it nonmarket compon  the cpi has advantag in communic to the public  which other have mention   also  tip deriv measur of inflat expect are base on the cpi   now  i would prefer a point goal of   percent for the core cpi and     percent for the core pce  and i would specifi a flexibl  e horizon    i agre that longer is better  and i won   t put a number forward at this point  turn to the group question  i would not support tri to achiev a consensus on the inflat object   i do not think we can choos an inflat object that bind futur committe   we don   t have a statutori mandat  and peopl   s opinion will chang as person and experi chang   thus  we would need to revisit this issu on an annual basi  and i think that would be difficult   it seem to me that the consensus view is the de facto inflat object   for this reason  given my earlier comment  i would prefer simpli survey committe member on their view about what constitut price stabil   final  if we go this rout  i would recommend that we publish simpli the rang and the central tendenc of the member    object  as i have alreadi said  i support the propos trial run   i thought the summari of the econom project provid in vinc   s memo was good and use  and i think we should go forward with that   the more difficult issu for me is how to convey the forecast uncertainti  while it is import to convey the uncertainti surround the forecast  i would not combin member    central tendenc forecast with the frb us confid interv   i think you   re mix thing here  both in term of what you   re tri to talk about and then who is talk about it   is one the committe   s  and is the other the staff   s   is one refer to one thing or to someth els   i think you will creat confus over  e  and so i would be reluct to go down that path  mr  chairman   thank you for the opportun to comment
thank you veri much   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d also like to lend my voic to the vote of thank to the staff on what i thought was an excel set of memo   i think the staff did an outstand job in summar a lot of the nuanc and the detail that are involv  perhap it come as no surpris that i   m in favor of defin the committe   s price object numer and announc that goal to the public   i believ that specifi our long run price stabil object numer would focus our polici discuss and help anchor expect   by reduc the public   s uncertainti about our goal  long run expect would becom less respons to chang in short run inflat   this should help enhanc monetari polici   s flexibl to respond to econom shock as we may deem appropri   thus  rather than be unduli constrain  i believ it would actual add to our flexibl   in this way  it   s consist with the other goal of monetari polici and increas monetari polici effect  it would also increas social welfar to the extent that it help us avoid  e inconsist polici  sinc we know welfar under commit general exceed welfar under discret when agent are forward look   thus  i believ a numer goal would be a long run anchor to our monetari polici and help coordin our own discuss of what appropri polici might be  now  as vinc laid out the question  we have to make a number of decis in make that numer goal oper   i feel more strong about some aspect of the design than about other  and mani of the choic are interrel   for exampl  a long horizon should mean a tighter control rang   a long horizon make the choic between headlin and core less import   a long horizon make the choic of core in fact less compel   i think that ani propos will have their pros and con   as i said  i   m not necessarili wed to all of the particular  but i will make a propos   but let me emphat stress that what is more import than the specif is that we agre on a numer object and a horizon for it achiev  regard which price index  i prefer the headlin cpi even though it   s like to be harder to control and forecast in the short run than the core   mani foreign central bank with experi have tend to move toward the headlin cpi number  indic that it can in fact work   the headlin cpi is a measur that   s more understood by the public  so the communic argument are import here   unlik the pce  as has been mention a coupl of  e  or the gdp deflat  the cpi is not revis  which help us in assess our account in reach our goal   i also prefer headlin to core for our goal becaus i don   t want to convey the idea that we are insensit to the wider array of price that influenc behavior   particular becaus  as governor   indic  the stochast process or properti of individu element of the cpi may chang over  e   if we start defin a subset of price  we could find ourselv in troubl   i think we would also have the opportun to use the core in our communic when explain whi we might or might not react with polici to a temporari blip in headlin inflat   i view focus on headlin and use the core for other purpos as a mean of enhanc our communic effort   again  this practic is similar to the practic of other central bank that announc their inflat goal   of cours  i think it   s go to be terribl import for us to consid how we will respond to and communic about the inevit miss from our target  regard a point goal or rang  i strong favor announc a point goal   in realiti  there is a rang around this point that reflect the precis with which we policymak think we can control inflat  and this control rang will differ depend on the inflat measur use and the  e horizon select   howev  i   m reluct to announc a rang as part of our inflat goal becaus i think it would be veri difficult to ensur that the public would not interpret it as a rang over which we are indiffer   so for the headlin cpi  i would specifi and announc a target of   percent   that   s consist with our goal of price stabil and the es  measur bias of the cpi of be someth slight less than   percent   i pick   percent becaus i take serious our mandat for price stabil   sinc i do not believ that there is ani long run tradeoff between inflat and employ  we have no reason not to seek and meet that goal over a reason period   i recogn that some may feel that a   percent target is too low as the risk of deflat or zero bound restrict on nomin interest rate might call for a greater cushion   i understand those argument  and they are certain plausibl   but for various reason  some articul by peopl around this tabl  i   m less concern about our abil or the economi   s abil to deal with those issu  both of deflat and zero bound   but i accept that some peopl may have more concern about it than i do  regard  e horizon  i feel strong that we should specifi a  e horizon by which we think we can achiev our target so that we can be held account for meet or miss a goal   sinc i favor use the headlin cpi  which is a littl more difficult to control  more volatil  than a core measur  i think a two year horizon would be appropri and  inde  achiev given the typic shock that hit the economi and the volatil of the cpi   for exampl  for the past ten year  the standard deviat of the month twenti four month cpi headlin inflat rate has been about     percent   i could also make the case that initi we may want to consid a slight longer horizon  especi if we choos a number like   percent and given that we are current well abov   percent   specifi a longer horizon at first may provid market with more opportun to adjust to the new regim and mitig some of the transit cost   as we converg to our target  we might be abl to shorten the horizon   i much prefer that idea to adjust the goal   i think the goal ought to be the goal  and we use the horizon to give us some flexibl  depend not onli on initi condit but also perhap in futur discuss on the natur of the shock that may caus us to do that   i don   t like the idea of not pick an op  target simpli becaus we   re not there yet   i think that   s not the right strategi  there remain the issu of how we treat deviat from our goal   that is  whether we let bygon be bygon or whether  for exampl  when inflat has been abov our target for a year  we must get it below our target for a year   our chosen inflat goal will impli a price level path with that goal   we need to decid whether or not we will permit perman deviat from that price level path   deviat from the price level path occur when inflat deviat from our goal   if inflat increas abov our goal for a  e  then we would need to bring inflat below our goal to return to the price level path that was consist with our initi announc inflat goal   similar  if inflat move below our goal  we would need to have a period of abov target inflat to return to the price path   altern  the committe might decid to accept perman deviat from the price path and choos to implement polici onli to return to the inflat level   i would prefer the former as a price level path becaus it prevent base drift  and i suspect that we will  on averag  more like be abov the target than below  and the ensu gradual eros of purchas power will be higher than we might have anticip  in either case  i think it   s import  regardless of which way we decid  that we make that choic conscious and weigh the cost and benefit of it and decid which regim we want to be in  i do think it   s critic that the fomc member reach a consensus  or at least a decis  on the goal and the definit of price stabil and essenti not disput those in public   i don   t think member need to agre on the model of the economi or the channel through which monetari polici affect the economi   inde  given the state of econom scienc  the differ in the model and the channel can actual aid in polici format   howev  the point of announc a numer definit of price stabil is to anchor expect and improv our account   without agreement on that definit  the benefit of such an announc would be critic diminish   the committe may want to period review the definit of particular such as the horizon as it gain experi oper under this structur  but i think it   s veri import that we reach a consensus on our announc goal  while i have offer my own choic on the particular  i believ that they realli are of secondari import to our public commit to an object  as far as the trial run is concern  i strong favor have a trial run for produc a forecast narrat in may  and i agre with the discuss last  e in that i like the idea of do it four  e a year   i also like the idea of incorpor a forecast narrat into the minut  which give particip the opportun to comment on the draft narrat   this is not the onli way to proceed  but i think that it is a good first step and that refin can follow   as i mention earlier  our discuss this morn highlight the real need for us to have a way of communic our polici view more effect and outsid the narrow confin of the polici statement as they are current construct  regard the narrat itself  i have two comment   first  i suggest ad the assum polici path as a variabl in the forecast   particip are ask to assum appropri monetari polici  and condit on polici path that can differ across particip emb differ in particip    prefer over outcom as well as differ across their model   if we are think about the forecast as a communic devic that enhanc the transpar of our policymak process  then we want to convey someth about the reaction function that is like to aris out of our committe   s decisionmak process   aggreg inform  such as the rang and central tendenc of the fed fund rate in the fourth quarter of each of the three year of the forecast  as we do with the unemploy rate  might be use without hold the committe to ani particular path   i think the idea of convey inform regard the uncertainti of the forecast is also import so that the public   not place too much emphasi on point forecast or narrow rang   moreov  uncertainti is clear larger than the rang of the point forecast of the committe  and yet i   m not sure  as has been mention alreadi  that use the forecast standard error out of the frb us model is the best solut sinc they are not consist with the forecast that was generat by the committe   we might  for exampl  even consid ask committe member when they submit their forecast to submit their own rang of uncertainti at the four quarter horizon and then use those es  to creat someth like a fan chart   in ani case  i   m look forward to a trial run in may   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start by way of background simpli by say that  while there may be some good theoret argument for adopt a numer inflat object  i actual view this consider as veri practic   what we   re talk about here are way to improv extern and intern communic and account   to the extent that communic is improv  it should certain aid decisionmak within the committe  decisionmak within the privat sector  communic with the congress and other about our object and tactic  and so forth   so i view those as veri practic issu  not theori  as far as the specif question  yes  i do believ that the committe   s price object should be defin numer   as far as the prefer price index  i   m realli fair indiffer about that   i think perhap what   s most import is that we pick one and stick with it   the core pce has the valu at the moment of be the one that we   ve been focus on   it   s in the number that we submit to the congress  but i don   t think that is necessarili determin   if we want to go to the core cpi or the overal cpi  actual those altern would be accept to me   that consider is a second or third order one  at least from my perspect  as far as the question about a point goal or a rang  i have a propos  though it   s not an origin one   i propos that we say that our target is someth less than but close to   percent  the ecb target   let me tri to explain whi i think that   s a good idea   i   d start with governor     s point that i don   t believ that there is a lot to be gain in the steadi state whether we   re at a littl below   percent or at     percent or even lower   i think a littl less than   percent is fulli consist with an object of low  stabl inflat  which is what we   re realli talk about here   moreov  the fact that it  sn   t have a bottom to the rang mean that  if we get lucki or if there   s an opportun to bring inflat down below   percent  we could take advantag of that  and that would be all to the good   i have some concern with a rang or a target that focus on     or someth even lower becaus i question how credibl it is  base in part on our experi in       when there may have been some anxieti extern but there was a lot of anxieti intern about the cours of inflat  the zero bound  how polici was go to be conduct  and how effect it was go to be   those memori are pretti clear in my mind  and i don   t believ we ought to select a rang or a target with which we are not comfort when push come to shove  as it may at some point  as far as the  e horizon  i would say normal someth like two to three year     normal    is an import word becaus i can imagin circumst in which that  e frame is not appropri   but there   s a tradeoff here   if the  e frame is too short  we   re probabl go to confront more interest rate volatil than we want as we tri to achiev the inflat object   if it   s too long  it   s meaningless   so in my judgment  you have to come out somewher in the middl  and my best judgment about that at the moment at least is two to three year  but i guess i would be will to be persuad otherwis  as far as whether the committe particip should joint decid on the goal  i think the answer to that is    yes      i   m not sure about exact the mechan for achiev that  we   d probabl have to reaffirm the goal everi year as the composit of the committe chang  but i think that   s far prefer to the other altern i can think of   if that is not possibl and we go to someth like the propos in question number     survey the committe member   my reaction is that it is probabl anoth appropri place for a trial run   we can see what we get back and what we make of it at the end of the day   how should the public be inform  well  if we do adopt a numer object  at some point we   re go to have to tell the public becaus that   s the honest way to go   even if we didn   t want to  we   d be talk about it here  and sooner or later it would becom public   i don   t have ani problem with that  just a word or two about the forecast exercis and the possibl of a trial run   i am all in favor of that   i think we   ll probabl learn some thing from it  and that   s the intent  have said that  i guess the one bit of caution that i would offer as we go down this path is that i think it   s import to illustr the degre of uncertainti associ with the forecast and so forth   at the same  e  we want to make sure that we don   t rais uncertainti about our ul  polici object   about our commit to price stabil and it relat to the other half of the dual mandat   so we have to make sure as we illustr uncertainti that we separ uncertainti about the outlook from uncertainti about our object   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also want to thank the staff for the memo that were sent out befor the meet   they were veri help in prepar for this meet  i am in favor of defin our price stabil object numer   as other have note  be more explicit about our price object will enhanc both extern and intern polici discuss  improv our transpar  and help coordin the public   s expect about inflat   although my expect about the gain that we can expect from adopt a numer inflat object are modest for the short term  i think that over the long term the benefit will prove to be more signific  my prefer price index is the headlin cpi   i prefer the cpi main becaus it is familiar and better understood by the public than other inflat measur   in addit  the fact that the tax code  social secur benefit  tip  and mani other contract are index to the cpi mean that peopl probabl focus more on it than altern measur   also  research done by my staff suggest that both near term and longer term household inflat expect are more strong correl with the behavior of the cpi and it core measur than with the pce altern   i understand that a lot of peopl prefer the pce becaus of the fair substanti role of owner    equival rent in the cpi   howev  it   s worth note that the small weight place on the oer in the pce is a result of the larger weight place on medic servic and nonmarket activ  each of which come with it own problem   becaus a numer object could provid predict and confid in the purchas power of money  i favor express our object in term of an overal inflat measur rather than the core measur  though core measur are certain import for help us to disentangl the trend in headlin inflat from temporari influenc  i think it is the overal inflat rate that is import in a welfar sens   for that reason  it make sens to me to express our object in term of the overal measur  if the committe were to choos the headlin cpi  i would favor a midpoint target of   percent and an accept rang around the midpoint of plus or minus   percentag point   if the major of the committe prefer the pce  i would choos a midpoint of    percent   a few year ago i gave a speech on this issu and note that i would choos     percent  but becaus of the revis that were receiv last year  i move that up to    percent   whichev measur we might choos  i would like to see the object express in term of an averag over the medium term  say three to five year   to me  the real disciplin of an object come when it is measur but also realist   so state our object in term of an averag achiev over a few year provid a reason way for the public to explicit gaug our perform   i should be clear  howev  that i don   t think that ani deviat from this perform object should automat trigger action by the committe   howev  it is quit reason and use for us to provid an explan or a plan of action  depend on the circumst  if we look over a recent three year to five year period and find that we miss our state inflat goal or if we look forward and see that we   re like to miss that goal  to the question of how often we set an object  i agre with presid    governor    and a few other that we should just set it and forget it    laughter   the staff may tell us that there are some govern issu to address  and it might be desir for vote member to reconfirm the object at the start of each year   but the presumpt should be that  onc it   s chosen  the object should be refram onli if there is a compel and easili explain reason to do so  in regard to the question pertain to the group  my first choic would be to generat a consensus object and communic the desir near term rang to the public   if we can   t agre on the desir of this option  i do favor share individu prefer as part of our discuss in the committe  and i would have no object to have my prefer numer object made public in the meet minut   obvious  this convers is go to be public five year from now through the transcript anyway   i do believ that share our own think about inflat object among ourselv has valu   so i wouldn   t consider it a deal breaker if other feel that we should keep this an intern discuss onli   howev  if we do have a convers about it  as other have point out  i presum that it is go to be reflect in the minut  and then peopl are go to wonder whi we   re not share the inform public  so it may be difficult to keep the detail under wrap onc we start make it public that we are have these convers  regard the propos for the forecast narrat trial run  i think it is a good step for the committe to take   i would also like to commend   and his staff for provid a use model   i like what the staff has propos  includ the summari inform provid in the two tabl and in chart     i onli have two chang to suggest   other have alreadi comment on one of them  and that is the issu around uncertainti   i do think it   s import for us to convey that there is some uncertainti around our forecast  but i   m not sure that use the frb us generat confid interv is the right way to go   but we can talk about that detail at some other point   the other issu is the refer to potenti output   it may be a good idea for committe member to comment on individu es  of potenti growth  but it may not be a good idea to use the staff refer to potenti growth without explicit guidanc from the committe   but both of these are detail   i support move forward with the trial run and am look forward to see the outcom of that   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to thank the staff   they   ve done a terrif job in help us with this   i   m go to tri to address the question in     s memo with a littl variat in order   on the first question  i do believ that the fomc should have a numer inflat object   we   ve discuss this befor   briefli  i think it would improv intern polici discuss   import  i think it would allow for clearer communic with the public  and the benefit of that is to help anchor inflat expect and enhanc the scope for monetari polici to stabil output   addit transpar would also fo  greater account  which i think is import   all in all  i don   t think these gain would be enorm   but they do come out in the plus column when i weigh them against the potenti cost   a cost i worri about and would not be prepar to pay is de emphasi on the other part of our dual mandat   maximum sustain employ   i worri that such de emphasi could occur in the mind of the public and even affect our own decis   so i think a numer inflat goal has to be enunci in the context of clear and convinc statement about our commit to both object  like governor    i thought it import to proceed out of order   i  too  would like to turn to question   on the  e frame becaus i think it   s extrem import to address that first   i consid it critic that we defin a numer inflat object as a long run goal  not at a fix  e horizon   i would find it veri hard to support a numer object without a long run horizon to provid a lot of flexibl to respond to output and employ consider   i believ that a fix  e horizon is inconsist with the dual mandat   the long run natur of the inflat object would have to be clear explain to the public in the context of the dual mandat  and i think we would need to stress that we would alway take the implic for near term econom and financi stabil into account when decid how to move toward our inflat object   i   ve said this on sever previous occas   i think our chairman propos a brilliant formul of this in his remark in st  loui in       and i   ve been long attract to the languag and view that he put forward in that speech on how to express this  now let me turn to question of which index and what number   on these issu  i am flexibl   over the long run  the various price measur appear fair close link   on methodolog ground  of cours  i   m enamor with thing like the market base core pce  and the chain cpi certain has it attract    laughter   a coupl of year ago  after our first discuss of this in       i decid to enunci in my own speech a so call comfort zone  and i talk about it in term of the pce   but part becaus of that experi  i  too  have come to appreci the valu of public familiar   in my contact with the public when i start to talk about the inflat rate and the price index for person consumpt expenditur  exclud food and energi  i still see quit a few blank stare    laughter   i don   t think it   s just me   the fomc has been provid pce price inflat project in our monetari polici report sinc februari        mani of us have been talk about our goal in term of the pce price index  but the cpi is still entrench in the mind of the public as the measur of inflat   that   s probabl whi central bank around the globe defin their inflat object in term of the cpi  like other  i   ve also found that the public is quit skeptic  probabl right so  of measur that exclud food and energi   those are import out of pocket expens   i agre with the argument that  if we have a long run goal  there is an advantag to use a total rather than a core index   of cours  we can refer to the behavior of the core index in explain what we see go forward in our own intern deliber   so at this point  i think i   ve chang my mind  and i would agre that total cpi is probabl now my prefer altern   but  again  i don   t feel strong  and i could go along with core pce  with regard to a point valu for the inflat goal or a rang  i found veri interest in the if paper that mani central bank have both   the point serv as a focal point  and i think that there are good reason  particular as governor   emphas  for have a focal point   the rang seem use as a communic devic to remind the public that inflat control is not perfect and that inflat is go to vari   i   m comfort with that approach   as for a specif number  again  i think econom theori and empir evid   i agre with governor     suggest that the welfar function is pretti flat over a rang of possibl valu   i don   t think we should aim at zero proper measur becaus some cushion against the zero bound seem prudent   i also worri about an advers interact with downward nomin wage rigid   that hasn   t been import in recent year becaus product growth has been high   but if product growth were to declin  i believ that could becom pertin  howev  there is also noth to be gain by set a goal higher than where inflat expect are current anchor   i remain comfort with the goal that i enunci some  e ago   a long run inflat object of     percent for the core pce inflat rate   i agre with governor   that we have to take transit cost into account   it   s a question of weigh the gain from be at a better number against the transit cost  and i thought about that tradeoff when i decid on       i know we   re not there  and i guess i decid that the tradeoff was worth make   i don   t in ani way want to say that the case was compel  but i could certain continu to live with that number   to cast it in term of the overal cpi  i think a compar number  given the averag measur bias  would be about   percent   the veri first fomc discuss of this topic that i particip in  which was in januari       came out with a numer inflat object of exact   percent  and i think we were refer to the cpi at that  e   as for my prefer target rang for headlin cpi  which is more volatil  i translat the   to   percent for core pce that i   ve been talk about into a   to   percent rang   again  i   d emphas the   percent goal for the cpi and stress that the fomc would not be indiffer among valu insid the rang  let me now turn to question about the formul of an inflat goal as a group decis and the communic of that goal   i   ve long thought the best way to make this decis is to arriv at a consensus or general agreement among the full set of fomc particip   that is how we have tradit decid on communic issu sinc we do all have to live with the consequ   i favor that approach over a survey   i might support a survey  but i realli think this is a prefer approach by far   it would produc much less muddl communic   statement of a consensus view is probabl prefer to a formal vote  which in some sens might up the ant vis  vis the congress   it might be appropri for the committe to revisit the set of this object from  e to  e   presum  it would not and should not chang veri often   there could be reason at some point that it might chang   i hope it wouldn   t chang veri often  but perhap it should be reaffirm and reconsid annual   if we do reach a consensus on the numer object  i think it should be express in the minut  turn to the forecast narrat  i veri strong support the propos experi   i thought the staff summari of the januari econom project show that a use minut style narrat could be produc  and i think that process is go to work even more effici if we provid individu narrat of the type that are suggest for the trial run   on detail  i agre with the point that presid hoenig and  i believ  presid pianalto made about the confid interv   i think we should examin the track record for a broader rang of forecast  our own past project  those of the cbo  and other and experi with that   i would also like to give some support to presid     s suggest that  at least in the experi  we might want to includ the feder fund rate or our own individu project for the feder fund rate
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i suppos it come as no surpris to anybodi who has been at the tabl here listen to these discuss over the past   it seem like forev but i guess it has been onli a coupl of year  laughter    that i   m not in favor of a numer price object   howev  it   s funni   as presid   was go through her thought that lead her to believ that the benefit outweigh the cost  i find myself in agreement with a lot of what she said   i just come out for the side on which the cost outweigh the benefit  i found the materi dissemin for this meet veri use   i would have like a bit more  e to look at some of it  but it was veri use in my own think  particular vinc   s encourag  implicit or explicit  to think about one   s person definit of price stabil   so i did that a bit   i thought about that definit as oppos to just whether or not i was in favor of a numer target   i guess it come as no surpris that my definit of price stabil tend to be more qualit than quantit   it   s a rate of inflat  not a price level  that   s so low and stabl that it  sn   t interfer with decisionmak as busi invest and consum save and plan for the futur   achiev a rate of inflat that meet that sort of definit is the best we can do as a central bank over the long run to achiev both of our object   that is  price stabil and maximum sustain growth   and  i would take governor     s think on this  in an environ of financi stabil   i know that this definit sound simplist  it certain isn   t origin   but i think it effect convey the challeng we face as we strive to meet both of our goal in the context of chang econom realiti  i do recogn  howev  that even in the context of a qualit definit of price stabil  some quantif is use as one think about current progress   in that regard  all other thing be equal  i would worri about rate of inflat abov   percent   similar  rate below   percent seem to carri with them the potenti for instabl and certain a lot of concern around this tabl  as we saw in      and as presid  n mention   base on the research i   ve seen  i think it is hard to distinguish the benefit of     versus    or   or     versus       i think our experi over the year that i   ve been on the committe suggest that the   to   rang is a pretti good definit  at least for the  e be  of what it mean to have veri stabl price   i have some doubt about whether there   s ani singl op um inflat rate   i think thing chang  and if we chose a particular number as the op um inflat rate  it might caus us to fail to appreci an evolut in the way the economi work and to exercis our judgment  i think judgment is veri import in polici format   it   s import that we exercis judgment about the right polici in a  e way  and i   m afraid that state a particular number as an op um inflat rate would end up make us more number determin and less judgment determin  and i think that would be a step backward in term of polici format   so although my own notion of what constitut stabl price is use to me as a policymak  i think it   s import that it not be seen as be determin to polici action   one reason that be explicit about price stabil is thought to be use is that it can shape market expect   but price stabil isn   t our onli goal   maximum sustain growth is a goal as well   in the short run  there can be tradeoff between the two   market need to know that short run polici will alway be a balanc act   we can tell them that  but the action of set a numer inflat target will speak louder than word   it will say we valu one goal over the other   as the materi prepar for this meet point out veri well  the benefit of a numer target need to be weigh against the potenti for harm   communic and transpar may seem to be improv  but confus could be creat as well  and that confus could extend from the public to the congress  which would be difficult from  e to  e   now  i know that we can meet all these concern   i know that we have a wide array of way in which we can communic   i know given all the mani  mani word that have been written on this subject that there are mani way to make clear all of the tradeoff that go into choos a particular object   but i wonder  along with presid    whi we want to spend our  e and our polit capit right now or any  in the near futur to ensur that we   re convey all the subtleti of an inflat target   i don   t see that spend  e and polit capit do it bring us enough advantag  neither the market nor the public need to be told a number to believ that we seek low and stabl rate of inflat   we have the credibl that come from a long period of success on this front   market form expect base on what we   ve accomplish not just on what we say we will do   obvious  if we didn   t have some success here or if we were at the start of an inflat control process  like brazil or mexico perhap at point of  e in the past  we could benefit from establish a target   even then we   d have to have the right follow up polici action and result or the target wouldn   t be at all credibl   our track record as a central bank prove our commit to low and stabl rate of inflat and show that we   re account for our action   that commit and account work to shape expect and  combin with sound polici  would keep inflat low and stabl in the futur   in the end  that will shape the best environ for save  invest  and long term growth  now  it   s clear  and i have known this all along   onli a few of us think along the same line  and mayb nobodi think along the same line that i do   so let me focus on some of the answer from my perspect to the question that are be pose   as an individu  do i believ that the committe   s price object should be defin numer   no   i think the benefit of do that could be outweigh by the potenti for harm   if we have to do it  and that may happen  what is my prefer price index   well  mine is not unlik that of   and some other   i come down on the side of headlin cpi  i think it encompass the rang of cost that are import to peopl   food is import to peopl   energi is import to peopl   convey our concern about inflat realli need to be done in term of a headlin number  and i would pick the headlin cpi  i   m also in favor of a fair long and mayb flexibl  e horizon   the two of those work togeth  if you pick a headlin number over a longish period  the headlin number isn   t as volatil as it is in a short period   it is someth on which we can focus over a longish period of  e as a goal that   s easili understood  easili communic  and reach over that longish period  do i have a point goal or a rang   as i mention earlier  i   m more or less comfort right now with an inflat goal in a rang of   to   percent   in term of where in that rang we should be at ani  e  i think it   s hard to make the call as to whether     is better than   or       i do set some store by stabil over  e   like most of the rest of you  i   d be worri if we   re in that rang but we thought we were go to get out of it rapid at some point   as for the  e horizon  i said a fair longish period of  e   i would go at least three year  mayb five year  or mayb an indefinit  e horizon becaus i think it   s import  as   discuss  that we recogn both our goal   if you pick too short or too fix a  e horizon  you do impli that at some point you   re go to sacrific the growth goal for the inflat goal   now  i realiz that  if you set a goal  you do tri to manag tradeoff that way   but i think that you   ll be shape expect that  when the three year period or the five year period end  you   ll be take action   mayb you don   t want those expect to be out in the market  as a group  should committe particip arriv at a consensus view of it goal   if we arriv at a view  i don   t think a consensus view is necessari   it might undermin the divers of viewpoint that i think is the strength of the committe   if we had a consensus view that we arriv at either formal or inform  it would have to be communic to the public   with regard to the next question   particip be survey regard their prefer level of a numer object   i think that is sort of what we   re do now   it   s probabl help for intern communic that i know where everybodi els stand and you know where i stand   it   s benefici to the inform flow around the committe   so if a survey of particip is done in a way that is use for develop polici and for communic among ourselv  i think it would be help   if it   s done in a way that tri to forc consensus  i   m not so sure it would be as use  all of this discuss will be public in the transcript   the fact that we   re have a discuss about how each of us feel about price stabil will be made public   i   m comfort with it be public in the transcript   whatev summari is done in the minut is probabl good enough unless we should come to the decis that we are go to have a numer price object  in which case it has to be public and would be in the minut and might even be subject to some further communic  i think the trial run will be interest   i   m all in favor of provid the inform for a trial run in may   i have a hard  e see how you do a forecast narrat  particular if it has a minut style format like the draft that vinc sent us  in two week and then the minut in three week   i think the trial run is go to be use in show us how that feel   it may suggest that we just do minut in two week and incorpor the narrat into the minut   but we   ll see how the trial run goe  i also want to be count in the camp of peopl who worri about the rang of uncertainti  the fan chart   i think they   re veri hard to describ   just look at  for exampl  our confid interv around gdp   our central tendenc is slight below   percent in most of        but our    percent confid interv is somewher between zero and     i don   t know what the public make of that  and i don   t know if we further anyth about our own credibl in explicit identifi that rang of uncertainti over that short period   i have no doubt that the math is all beauti and correct   i just think that  as a communic devic  the chart realli is defici   we need to think about how to convey uncertainti  which we certain have  in a way that is help and not hurt
thank you   presid
have been a presid for three week  i hope i can still get away with some tentat or preliminari remark on this subject   there realli are two question   the first question is whether or not to go forward  and the second is  if we do go forward  how to implement it   regard the first question  have onli today been privi to these discuss  i   m not go to make up my mind quit yet   but i would like to make a few comment on the    how    side of the question in the event that we do go forward  first  i favor a quantit price object   as to whether it is an explicit object and whether it has a point goal or a rang  i can see pros and con to both   the point goal can help in influenc long term inflat expect  and an indiffer rang can be more compat with the dual mandat   on balanc  i favor a point goal with comfort band   regard exact number  i   ve not settl on a specif number  but i would think that someth in the rang of     to   percent  depend upon the index that   s chosen  is a reason guid to polici and compat with the dual mandat   on my prefer price index  i   ve been influenc by the discuss today   my start point was core pce base upon consist with the past   i   m more convinc now that an overal measur make sens becaus we should be consist with the pocketbook experi of the public  sinc we   re communic to the broad public   so i would favor one of the overal measur   i   d like to stress that i am veri much in favor of an approach that minim the polit risk of conflict with the congress and dilut of the principl of central bank independ   for this reason i think that an unspecifi medium term  e horizon would work best  especi at the initi stage  i believ that flexibl go into this polici is sensibl and import   i   ve thought a bit about how we realli ground this decis and ground the specif choic that we make   in simplist term  i would say it should    work      mean that the polici should enabl the achiev of actual outcom   given the difficulti and the complex that i   m learn about and the mani domest and intern uncertainti  i think we should be flexibl enough to have high confid that we   ll achiev the state object   foreign central bank have chang the detail of implement of inflat target   such chang have appar not affect their credibl   and i believ that the fomc should be abl to do the same thing   final  i believ that  for inflat target to be effect  it goal should be communic as a substanti consensus   i   m make some distinct between the reflect of an actual consensus versus the communic of some degre of uniti on the part of the committe   mr  chairman  let me just end there   thank you
thank you veri much   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think that  yes  we ought to defin a committe price object numer  but it   s a close call and will depend on how the object is implement   the benefit will be small  but if we do it right  the cost will be even smaller   the benefit includ slight better anchor inflat expect   the evid across countri is that the differ between inflat target countri and non inflat target countri on this is veri small   clearer discuss  protect against cumul chang in inflat either up or down   under one of your successor  mr  chairman    laughter   i do think there   s confus out there becaus mani fomc particip have enunci   to   percent comfort zone   peopl assum that that   s the committe   s target   it   s not mine   the committe has never vote on it   i think we need to clarifi that fact  and frank  i hope we don   t come out quit where   to   percent core pce comfort zone are  the risk  as presid   note  is that the emphasi on inflat will detract from the emphasi on output stabil   i think output stabil has valu in and of itself   it is veri hard to plan person spend when there are busi cycl   output stabil is not onli a mean to inflat stabil   we ought to pay attent to it  and i think there   s a risk that we could pay too much attent to inflat and not enough to output   governor   actual crystal my concern when he said that he hope that discuss in this committe would focus on the inflat path   that   s exact what i   m worri about       laughter   the committe should focus on the inflat path  but not onli the inflat path
i agre with you on this   you want to talk about the implic of the one for the other
i would have an inflat object  not a price level object   a price level object has a lot of attract in term of plan and pin thing down  but if we want to proceed  we ought to proceed in babi step  and i would start with an inflat object   it wouldn   t be an averag over  e   we would alway be aim at our object go forward without make up for miss one way or anoth  like presid   and governor    i continu my answer to the question after number   with number   becaus that answer influenc the other one   so i would  as you can imagin  be veri flexibl and not have a fix  e frame   we   re talk about long term effect   it depend on the size and the natur of the shock hit the economi  how far you are from your object  how long you want to take to get back  the implic for the output gap of return through one path or anoth  and other particular circumst   in addit  the committe over the past fifteen to twenti year has work veri well with what we   ve call    buy insur    or risk manag type of techniqu   those techniqu impli that you aim away from the central tendenc from  e to  e becaus you see that the tail of the distribut are fatter on one side or anoth   the cost of miss one way or anoth is greater   aim away from the goal everi onc in a while  at least for a short  e  promot stabil   that   s anoth reason to be flexibl and not have a fix period   among the circumst in which that might aris  as governor   note  are  e when there   s a risk of financi instabl  like the fall of       on the index  i agre with presid   that there   s no singl index and we ought to be look at everyth to determin what the under inflat process is and where it   s go  in term of our communic  i   m drawn to the total cpi   it   s most familiar to the public  and therefor  it would perhap help tie down expect   there   s no reason for a long run target not to be comprehens in a way that   s meaning for long run plan   the cpi is not revis  and it   s fulli transpar in it construct   we have problem with the nonmarket price in the pce  they get revis   we don   t total understand and can   t replic how they   re put togeth in the pce  and that bother me   the revis  too  bother me   the staff made a strong argument that they shouldn   t bother me becaus it   s onli the implic go forward   but presid   crystal a risk in a speech he made by say that  if we had onli known in      what the true inflat rate was  we would have act differ   i   m not sure that   s true   we were take account of a lot of thing  but i can understand how somebodi who wasn   t in the system would think that it was true becaus of the focus on that particular inflat rate   i   d rather focus on someth that  sn   t get revis so that peopl can   t come back and say     well  if onli you had known this  you would have done that      a lot of second guess is go on  and i   d rather take that revis of the price index off the tabl as one reason for that  i would do a point with a rang around it  with emphasi on the point   sinc there   s no fix horizon  we should be abl to defin our ul  goal   by the way  i would use core inflat and the other thing as intermedi target   i wouldn   t give up look at core and everyth els  but i would defin the goal as total inflat   so then i would have a point   that point should have a gravit pull   general we ought to be move toward the point  though except might aris if there were financi distress or reason for move away   our forecast ought to be pull us toward the center of the rang   i would put a rang around that point to communic that shock happen   we can   t be expect to hit the point all the  e   ordinarili we   d lie within the rang and be tend toward the middl   anoth thing that a rang would do is give a sens of a nonlinear reaction function   if thing got outsid the rang  then we might react even more strong than we would insid the rang   that would be a use signal to send as well   so i would say plus or minus   percent  perhap  i found the question of the level veri difficult   i do worri about the zero bound   the anxieti is not entir in the public   it was insid this room in       it was insid me  anyhow  as i was vote on polici   in theori there were way of deal with this  but in practic it wasn   t clear that they would work  and i didn   t want to test them   so i think the zero bound is an issu   that concern led me to a cpi of at least   percent  which i think take care of most of the zero bound problem   but we have inflat expect anchor at     now   there is veri littl gain from go from     to    i think   i don   t want to count on a credibl bonus in get there   i don   t think there   s ani evid   if we could get that bonus  it would be nice  but i don   t want to count on it   so i think i   d go opportunist mayb from     to     the transit cost of go from     to   are real   they   re palpabl   they concern unemploy   the long run gain from go from     to   are veri theoret   nomin illus  tax system trapezoid in marti feldstein   s tax system  these type of thing    laughter   i think they are obscur and theoret   so  if i had to defin someth  i   d start with     now and mayb tell the public that we could move down to   later   that   s more consist  where would we go on the decisionmak   i think we should tri to reach a consensus  we ought to have a good discuss   everybodi sit around the tabl ought to come togeth  part becaus this will last more than a year  and so peopl who aren   t vote are effect becom bound even if they   re not liter bound   if we can   t do that  we ought to vote   but i hope we can reach a consensus   as for how the public should be inform  obvious it would be in the minut  but also in the monetari polici report and tes oni   i don   t think we need to decid that now  but i do think we need to decid in term of inform the public and inform ourselv   this issu is veri complex with lot of ramif   even if we found the center of graviti as to what the committe agre on  we   d have to think veri  veri care about how to express that and what it impli for polici choic under differ circumst   i view this  at least for this part of the inflat goal  as just anoth step in a long process befor the committe should be comfort with go public   we need paper that explor these implement problem and implic  and then we need to agre among ourselv what all of that mean  as for the propos trial for produc a forecast narrat  i strong support that   the issu that have been point out are key   how to express the uncertainti is veri  veri hard   if someon ask me to express my uncertainti  i have no idea how i would do that   i would call dave and ask him to run the model   laughter  and he would get the model result   that   s exact what i would do   but there may be other way of do that  and i think we need to explor that issu further  the path for the fed fund rate is a veri difficult issu as well   i   m not quit where presid   is about publish fourth quarter level   i have some concern about whether that would be view as a commit or not   i   d prefer to let sweden and norway experi with this a littl longer  laughter  befor the unit state join the full frontal review here   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool has a comment
given that i was so frugal   i think i was frugal   in my initi comment  i   d like to provid some veri quick addit comment   the biggest mistak that central bank have made histor have been when they   ve allow price stabil to slip away and it has had veri  veri larg effect on employ   if you have an intens interest in employ stabil  you ought to have an intens interest in price stabil  and we can point in the histori of the feder reserv to the great depress and the period from      to        i can   t guarante that a price stabil numer target written into the feder reserv act in      would have avoid those disast  but i think that it would have made a differ   we could also point to the japanes experi   if japan had had a clear endors in it formal polici of price stabil in       a decad of deflat and stagnat might have been avoid   those realli big mistak are what worri me and are whi i think that we should go in this direct   that point hasn   t been made  but to me it is the biggest argument for do it   the protect of high employ is the reason that we want price stabil  on the pce and the cpi issu  the reason that i favor the pce   and i could certain go for total pce   is that the cpi is subject to chang in weight as a consequ of public polici decis   the reason that the medic care compon of the cpi is onli   percent   and i think it   s around    percent in the pce   is that so mani entiti besid the consum pick up medic care expens   other part of the cpi are probabl subject to distort for that reason   i can imagin public polici in the health care area take two differ tack go forward   one would be a move toward the singl payer system  in which you and i would pay our medic expens through tax and not through co pay and write check to physician  the other would go in the direct toward health save account and tax incent  in which case much more of the medic care would come down on household and would show up in chang weight in the consum price index   to me that vulner of the index and the weight is a power argument   that   s the reason that hous is so big a fraction in the cpi   an unreason larg fraction   becaus other compon are affect the other way   i think that the case in term of public understand for the cpi would have been veri strong five year ago   but the feder reserv has been talk about the pce for quit a long  e now   in fact  if we were to move toward the cpi  it would be backtrack from the direct that this committe has taken in recent year   so i think the argument for continu at this point is realli for the pce   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i would just state a few point as sort of a predic befor dive into the question   first  i probabl have a bit of a financi market bias on this topic  and i would begin by say that the financi market right or wrong alreadi believ that we have some form of inflat target   so that   s in some way my own jump off point   i   ll admit that it   s soft   it   s confus   it   s a littl bit ugli   there is a lot of ambigu  but the question that   s ripe for consider is what the relat benefit and cost are of establish a more crystal clear object from that point   second  as background with respect to the econom forecast  the financi market have necessarili been forc to construct their own narrat   in fact  until veri recent  realli until the past year or so  they   ve not focus a lot on our project  i   m quit encourag that over the past twelv month they   ve spent more  e and attent on them   so it strike me that there   s a much clearer case for real net benefit in elev and explain our project   as a final jump off point  i would say that the outcom that weigh quit heavili in my assess of this subject is what quadrant we want to avoid   i drew for myself a simpl two by two figur   establish a target and not establish a target are on the y axi  and success and failur are on the x axi   in some way our job is to avoid establish a target and fail   we   re tri to avoid that quadrant   that quadrant strike me as consider wors than stay in some ambigu  such as where we are now  and over  e  as i think presid pool right warn  worri that we might fail   it strike me as import that there is somewher to go and that we still have an out   we can adopt some kind of shock treatment  as other countri with far less credibl have done   so i would say that the basi of my answer to these question is realli tri to avoid that quadrant  in weigh the relat benefit and cost  i   m more convinc that the benefit are small than that the cost are small   i   m realli not sure about the cost   for all the discuss that we   ve had here and for all that   s been written public about the inflat target question  what is far more import than our enunci of an inflat target is the way it work in practic   as to the point that presid  n made about our account and credibl  we could agre on the perfect inflat target with the perfect rang and have that all work perfect  but if we and our successor don   t abid by the rule that we set  then all is for naught   it remind me a bit of the discuss that occur in the congress about tax polici   they fight over whether tax polici is perman  they spend a lot of  e debat that back and forth  and it is not perman becaus other congress can immedi undo what they did   so i   m a bit hesit to suggest that  even with our best intent and even with unanim around this room  over  e we wouldn   t be send mix messag to the marketplac as our prefer chang and as our membership chang  with that  let me go to the question at hand   i would reserv the right not to make a final judgment on the price stabil goal question until we conclud our think to a signific greater extent on the econom project   should we defin a numer object   ul  there may be net benefit to establish the object  but i   m not yet convinc as to the gain  mayb even more import  i would prefer not to implement ani final decis on the numer object until we have made progress and have implement the econom project  and i   ve realli tri to focus on not prejudg the latter question   whi should those two issu be separ   i think they should for a coupl of reason   first  these project are go to be terribl import  and if we bundl them with our answer on the inflat target question  we would be step on our own messag and on our own focus   there   s a lot here for the capit market to swallow  particular as mani peopl around this room have describ what they   re tri to achiev   i feel as though the project would becom releg to the back burner in public discuss if they were place in tandem with an announc on the numer object  i   m also worri about the  e of the rollout   it   s easi for me to say that i would rather the  e to be more benign befor we make a decis on the numer object   that might be foolhardi   there may just not be a perfect  e in which to take this step  but  boy  i   d certain be more comfort if we announc an inflat target with which we were at that veri moment broad consist   to the extent that we   re not  in my own think about credibl and account  i would in answer to the rest of the question let my number be a littl higher and my  e be a littl more robust   my vital sens in combin these two question is that slow and steadi will win this race and that it would be hard to walk back from a numer object if we   re unabl to accomplish it proper  wherea i think we have onli gain to be made from take this in stage  regard the question of whether it should be a point or a rang  my answer is perhap too practic   i think the rang   for exampl  those that we   ve given on econom project   have been broad misinterpret by the market   if we look at the monetari polici tes oni and let   s just say  for purpos of exposit  that each of our forecast in the central tendenc is between   and   percent  that rang get report  and i think it is understood as the fomc   s belief that the economi will grow between   and   percent next year  which is quit differ from the statement that we   ve made   that is  we all have differ uncertainti band around our project  but the rang  even in the context of a numer object  is harder to explain   my prefer would be  if we were to go down that path  to establish a point and suggest that there could be varianc around it most of the  e   in that way  miss could be frequent  and the judgment that we made would be perceiv to be less mechan and less formula  with respect to the  e horizon  certain these word would be discuss in associ with one anoth   the languag with which i would be most comfort would be that the goal should be general achiev in the long term in a manner consist with the dual mandat   a flexibl horizon is more use for us to demonstr consist with previous fed action   it   s more consist with our focus on evolut and is more suggest that we   re not somehow cross the rubicon here   this is realli what we have long done  and we   re simpli take a next logic step   i don   t feel strong about the question of the price index   obvious  as governor kohn suggest  the more long term the focus is  the less the index matter  in term of the group versus individu dynam  i find it hard not to argu that a consensus view is far prefer   i would point out one consequ of the other way   if the judgment end up be too diffus  too individualist  we might actual get some negat valu on our communic with the financi market   my sens is that unanim is great  close to unanim is pretti good  and if we get much below a strong  strong major  i am worri about mix messag as this polici get roll out  in term of the project  on which i don   t think we   ve spent a ton of  e in today   s discuss   nor was that it purpos   i just reiter that most of our judgment here are forward look   most of our determin on polici are data depend   by focus on the project as a first step  i think we can put the market  broad defin  in better recognit of what that mean   i support the trial run in may   i suppos that the confidenti around that dri run is essenti to make it success   if word of that dri run found it way into a broader constitu  i think we   d veri quick find ourselv have to make decis befor be readi to do so   what i   ve seen of the narrat from the staff i thought was veri good  but i still am troubl about whether we can describ our uncertainti in a suffici robust way   i thought that was a veri good swing at it  but i reserv the right to revisit that note so that it convey our sens of uncertainti without sound too obscur   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i have two introductori comment   one  thank to the staff   that was a great job  as other have said   second  mr  chairman  i am assum that you   re go to seek a consensus of the particip on this  not just of the vote member
i guess i have the advantag or mayb the disadvantag of go near the end   i think hear the discuss is an advantag  though   i   m remind of the famous term that alan  span use      conundrum      and i view this as a kind of conundrum   we have the dual mandat in our legisl of price stabil and maximum employ or maximum output  but in our heart of heart  we believ that we realli can influenc onli one of those in the long term   the price stabil object   we also believ that influenc that object help us achiev the longer term object of maximum employ or maximum output as well   so if we set firm quantit guidelin for price stabil   and i   ll defin    firm    later   we   re then go to be push inevit to have some type of quantit guidelin for output   that consider lead you to the posit of    well  let   s not set too firm a quantit target for price stabil   let   s make it looser   let   s make it flexibl      there   s a sens of that from at least some peopl who have spoken here today  but then  of cours  the looser you make it  the more flexibl  the more the claim benefit decreas as a result   you have less of an anchor to inflat   you have less account and disciplin   you have less transpar and less facilit of intern and extern communic  which are the claim benefit of it  so i just want to say that i clear favor polici consist with low and stabl inflat  and i think we   ve done a pretti good job of it so far if you look back at the volcker year  the  span year  and the bernank year   i   m still not convinc that we should have a quantit goal for inflat at this  e   it   s a huge decis   it set us down a road that i think you just can   t revers  i don   t see the overrid reason for it as i   ve listen to this discuss   i   ve heard phrase such as    it   s difficult to quantifi the benefit        the benefit are not enorm        the benefit are small        it   s a close call      some peopl at least believ it   s a close call  and if polici is work well now  whi do it   i think it is riski   tom talk about the unintend consequ   kevin refer to avoid that corner of his grid  which i agre with complet   so i would proceed veri cautious on this  i  too  start at question   becaus  given our dual mandat  i think the  e frame is  in a sens  more import than the target   someon said that we need to specifi a  e horizon to be held account  and i agre with that statement   but then what   s the account for the other part of our dual mandat   wouldn   t someon say that it   s appropri that we be held account for the other part of our dual mandat   this thought bring me back to the conundrum i mention befor   a two year  e frame inevit rais the issu about the dual mandat  and that short a  e frame  sn   t give proper respect to the dual mandat either   i   m not comfort use the medium term  which other central bank have use   i think that over the busi cycl is better   i prefer to have no  e frame  or i   d be comfort with the terminolog that kevin had  which would work in that direct as well  get back to some of the particular point  what index would i prefer   i   ve talk public about a comfort zone of   to   percent core pce  but a long  e frame say let   s go to the overal measur becaus the overal and the core should be the same over  e   so i would shift to the overal measur  it is more understand   i can see argument for the pce or the cpi   i think that   s a second order question that we can talk about onc we decid whether to go overal or core  whether to take a point goal or a rang   again  go to a long  e frame push me toward a point  not toward a rang   someon threw out a rang of   to   percent or a rang around that   i get nervous when we have a wider rang becaus it get into the consider of whether it is a zone of indiffer   are we indiffer at ani point within that rang   if someon said     let   s have a point     and then we   d have bracket around it and that would give peopl the idea that we   re more comfort with it be within those bracket   but then  if there   s a shock and we go outsid the bracket   let   s arbitrarili say   percent and the bracket are   to   and then it get up to       are peopl go to assum automat that we will respond more immedi to that shock than if it were       i think that   s the type of situat you get into   so i would just stick with the point   i don   t see the benefit of go to the bracket   i am also nervous about start with a high number  to me      percent is a high number   i think that number would appear to the outsid world as opportunist and as a veri high number for this central bank to be set for it long term object   so i would prefer a number below   percent  the  e frame i   ve alreadi talk about   on the consensus  we don   t want to chang the number onc we set it   but we have a govern procedur  and i think this would be an import govern issu   we   d be oper in the absenc of a legisl mandat  and we have turnov among governor and presid and some pretti soon    laughter   this would probabl requir an annual reaffirm of the decis   i think you   d have to do it  given the turnov that would occur  i think it should be a consensus of all particip  not just the vote member   on the survey question  i smile when   withdrew his suggest  which he made last octob  about have a survey   the reason i smile is that i read the transcript  and it   s absolut amaz   more than half the peopl agre with the suggest that you withdrew   so     i just want to say that you have enorm influenc over this committe   laughter  but i agre it should be drop
thank you    laughter
today    laughter   on the experi  it is worthwhil  i think that we should proceed with it   it will provid us with more use inform   we have some specif suggest on the detail of it  but we can give those later
thank you veri much   governor
thank you   sinc lunch is loom  i   ll tri to be as brief as possibl  the key to what i hope we will be tri to achiev is better credibl to make monetari polici more effect and to fulfil our dual mandat better   i veri much agre with presid pool   s comment that it   s valuabl to make sure that we have some insur against mistak   it actual fit well into the risk manag framework that governor kohn had articul   that   s what i see as potenti valuabl about this   i do think that there is valu along the line that presid  n discuss in term of intern and extern account and articul   but it has to be seen in the context of a broader risk manag polici that help us to fulfil the dual mandat  that   s whi i would support move in this direct  although i   m also one of the peopl who see that it   s somewhat of a close call   one can make a good argument that there is valu in the insur  but it is hard to quantifi these thing  with respect to the particular price index  suppos peopl have more familiar with headlin cpi than with core measur or with the pce   i   m not sure in the real world that peopl know much about the differ among the various inflat measur   we talk about headlin cpi   they look at the headlin about inflat  and i don   t think that the distinct between core and cpi and pce are well known   but part of this is uncertainti on my part   i don   t understand the exact natur of the expect process or how expect affect behavior   ul  what i want to do is enhanc our credibl so that we can make monetari polici more effect   i lean toward core pce becaus it seem to be a bit better correl with the futur path of inflat  although in the long run they   re all veri high correl   core pce seem to be a bit better behav   with this credibl approach and also with what affect behavior and expect  my concern is that the more we deviat from our state object  either temporarili or for the long run  the less that object is taken serious   the more  e the chairman has to go to the congress and say     well  you know  our object is   but we have special circumst here and this transitori part there     that seem to be at odd with get to our object of enhanc credibl  now  i may be wrong   it may be that if peopl are realli familiar with cpi  then that   s the thing to focus on   i   m just not convinc of that becaus i think we know veri littl about peopl   s expect  the develop process  and their behavior process   i think it   s more just general credibl   that it   s clear the fed has tri to ensur that inflat  sn   t stray out of a particular rang or away from a particular point   that   s the messag  and that we achiev it   i think that   s the best way for us to achiev the dual mandat  on the third question  whether a point or a rang  my answer is    no      i want someth in between  much the same as what presid  n articul   perhap someth like no more than   percent but not much below   percent  someth like what the european central bank     becaus it is better not to have a rang for the reason that mani peopl have said but it is also nice to have a littl flexibl   this specif  sn   t explicit articul the rang  but it give us flexibl and keep us away from the zero point   i don   t see a lot of welfar benefit with go much below that  and i don   t see a lot of welfar benefit in move dramat from where we are now  which is not the best situat but is by no mean a terribl situat  with respect to the horizon  more flexibl is better   this fit in with the risk manag approach   if push come to shove  if i had to say a number  i   d say someth like three year plus or minus a year   but i think it would be better just to say over an intermedi term or a long run or a busi cycl or some other term that give us flexibl to respond to shock   i like presid pianalto   s approach to set it and forget it   unfortun  in practic that will be difficult becaus of turnov of the committe   if a goal is chang each year or is not reaffirm each year  the whole enterpris is undermin   so we have to make sure that  if we do articul a goal  we feel pretti comfort that member of the fomc  at least into the forese futur  would be comfort with that goal  otherwis the whole purpos of have the goal is undermin   with respect to the trial run for produc a forecast  i think that   s veri valuabl to do   i think we   ll learn a lot by actual do it to see what we feel comfort or uncomfort with regard uncertainti  thank you
thank you   governor    you had a two hander
yes   actual it   s an issu concern some inform that perhap   can provid for us   the ecb has use    less than   percent but close     and in a way i find that veri attract   but i do worri   i know the academ have been quit critic of that articul of a target as be a littl waffley   i don   t know if that   s realli accur or not      do you have ani feel for what the reaction has been   mayb peopl in general have been a bit concern about the ecb   s communic strategi   it may have to do more with the second pillar issu   but has there been ani problem in this regard
well  it is complex   i would say    yes      there are three thing   first  peopl find the statement rube goldberg ish   it just seem odd to say that it is less than   percent but close somehow  right   if you mean     percent  whi don   t you say       certain critic is direct there especi   second  the fact is that the ecb hasn   t achiev it   on this back page  if you look at their   percent line  you   ll see that veri seldom do they ever achiev it   that hasn   t help the communic piec   third  in general the ecb had communic problem   i can   t sort out those three  but i would say that my sens is that most peopl still see express it that way as a weak point
initi they began with below   percent and they clarifi below  but not too far below  then that creat at least a sens of a floor
an issu that aros for the ecb  too  in this regard is that they had a whole big review   similar to the one we   re do   and then they came up with someth that was consid rube goldberg ish
the polici peopl endors it even though all the paper that they had prepar for the confer didn   t
it just is a concern that we want to learn from other peopl   s experi  and on this particular issu there has been some experi that has not alway been favor  even though in one sens i actual like that approach and thought about it  i was a littl concern about exact the issu that   has mention   thank you
this is sort of obvious  but the further out you go  the more uncertainti there is about the purchas power of the euro   what would you tell someon to assum for twenti year    worth of euro inflat   if you can   t give them a number  that   s intensifi the uncertainti in a seem needless way
i guess they would think that they had put on a ceil and that it answer that question at least as well as ani other statement that has a number attach becaus they have a ceil   the fact that they have not hit it is a differ question  but they put it in place
a littl inform here   a chart in the right side of the blue folder from   show that  in consensus econom expect for ten year out  inflat has been pretti firm anchor at about     for the past three year
for the euro
for the euro area  without ani real fluctuat   in fact  there is less fluctuat there than in the u k  consensus econom and about the same fluctuat in their ten year swap rate as in the unit kingdom
that   s great   i   m not surpris that there is some mean to the financi market    es  of long run inflat there   that   s consist with the ecb   s view about how they conduct polici   i mean  this is more of an optic and communic issu   if that   s how they   re conduct polici  whi not say
vice chairman  you have the floor absolut    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i think three thing about our current regim are worth reflect on as to whether we can improv them   they are  first  the lack of clariti that exist about how we defin our object  second  the relat lack of textur that we provid about the outlook and the risk that underpin our decis relat to some other central bank  and third  the way we run our intern convers   in all these area  becaus institut are subject to inertia  we   re probabl short of the frontier of the achiev  but i think it   s worth think about whether we can get closer to the frontier   i just want to rais some question that i think are the hardest for us to work through in figur out how we should evolv   and i think we should evolv  the first issu is about the balanc between the benefit of the regim and the cost   the problem we face is that  base on what we know about the theori and the experi  the gain on expect relat to what we have alreadi achiev as a central bank look pretti small   i think there   s a broad consensus that they   re small   there   s a greater dispers of view about what the cost are   some of them are transit cost   how you get where you   re go and the polit issu that surround that   some of the cost are more uncertainti about the effect on how you oper go forward   the difficulti in judg the balanc between what we think we know about the potenti gain and those cost is that it   s hard to narrow uncertainti around the cost even after look at the experi of other central bank   as mani peopl have said  the experi of other central bank is pretti reassur as to the cost   it   s hard to argu that they are wors off becaus they have achiev this in term of outcom   but some of that uncertainti is difficult to narrow ex ant  and a lot of it will depend on judgment that we make about the design of the regim   but even those judgment won   t fulli answer the question becaus  even if we tie them down now  they would still leav some uncertainti about the effect on our incent  our behavior  and our manag of a regim that will have much more exact demand on communic  this problem is magnifi by the fact that it is hard for us to adopt a regim with an explicit  fix  relat short horizon and to justifi it as consist not onli with the dual mandat and the polit that surround that  but also   base on what we know about the experi of other central bank   with make sensibl decis about monetari polici that has multipl object over  e   i don   t think that outcom is realist for us as a committe   therefor  you   re talk about a rang of option that are much toward the softer end   no fix horizon  a horizon that vari accord to the circumst   the gain are go to look more tenuous  that   s one issu that i think is interest for us to think through  the second issu concern the initi condit and the transit cost   if you   re go to adopt an object that   s differ from what peopl think your object is and differ from what best es  of trend core inflat or trend inflat are today  those condit and cost are veri complic   the dialogu between   and   was veri interest   both choic that exist today  if we were go to launch today  look veri unattract   you can basic decid that you will pick a target that   s pretti close to what your judgment is about trend becaus that is slight abov what the market infer our object is   to valid a higher object than what they have been infer is awkward and hard to see   it would be easi to say that you   re go to adopt an object substanti lower than that and believ that it would be easi for us to make it a simpl  compel polit endeavor to achiev   so i think that issu about  e  initi condit  and transit cost are veri import and complic to work through   but i thought you did a nice job of lay out the obvious issu on both side  the third issu that i think is interest is the question about the strength of the consensus necessari to go forward and how you deal with it   i think you   d need a veri strong consensus to go forward   some would view this chang in regim by the fed as the most signific sinc humphrey hawkin  mayb sinc well befor humphrey hawkin  and so you   d want to have a veri strong consensus   when you decid  on the strength of that consensus  you had better move forward   you have to have agreement   peopl have to agre that they   re go to oper under that regim  and i think we will  in effect  need to bind our successor to oper within that regim  even if you have a regim in which  becaus of the legal or practic circumst surround the institut  you have to have a period reaffirm of that object  in effect you   re bind our successor becaus we all agre that onc you do this you can   t go back   we can   t contempl the possibl that we   re go to adjust it in respons to the chang prefer of differ committe over  e  the fourth issu that i think is interest for us is that we have to design a process of intern deliber befor launch that allow us to get more comfort with the way we would oper   the aspect of our intern decisionmak process that are least well suit to oper comfort in ani of the variant of the regim that we   ve been discuss are the lack of clariti that we live with about what our individu prefer are  about how that inform our differ view about the structur  about how we inform our choic about appropri  desir path for inflat  and about what monetari polici we think is consist with that   as we   ve been discuss  we need to bring a littl more intern clariti to that convers   we need to know whi we   re disagre when we disagre if we   re go to be better at think through difficult choic   there is also the relat gap in how we talk about this stuff today  as don kohn said  even if you onli talk about a regim toward which you may be lean or public disclos thing about your forecast or move in the direct of a quantit definit of inflat  we   re go to have to have a more explicit convers about what we think is the appropri path or slope of the path   even if we don   t want to adopt a fix horizon that vari over  e and have that embed in what we disclos about our forecast  we   re go to have to have more explicit convers about what we think is an adequ  accept path toward trend   that is a complic convers to have  and in my brief experi on the committe  we haven   t spent much  e think about those kind of choic   we   d prefer to live with squishi  lack of definit  and ambigu around those kind of thing becaus it is easier   i don   t think we   d have that option in a regim in which we   re move toward more frequent disclosur  three year forecast  and a central tendenc of a path for these kind of thing   so my fourth issu is that we need to be care in think through how we   re go to get comfort with the evolut in our intern regim that   s go to be necessari to live within these kind of regim befor we launch  my last point is   i   m not sure how to describ this   about the stabil in ani propos we adopt   we   re all go to be tempt to soften the edg of what we   re agre on to make the consensus as broad as possibl   we need to be care that  if we adopt the intermedi thing  we look at them and think they will stand up pretti well to extern critic and that we   re not go to find ourselv uncomfort with have move to that intermedi posit   i think we   re go to get pull natur further toward more clariti   the discuss about the past   for exampl  whether we reveal the condit assumpt of our forecast   is the best exampl of that   that   s one instanc in which you might decid that it   s expedi to agre today that we   re go to have an unstat  undisclos  appropri polici condit assumpt for a forecast that has more clariti   but over  e  as we   ve seen in other case  there   s go to be a lot of pressur to say     but what   this tell us realli   we don   t realli understand this      so we want to think through this question about how to do someth that is go to look stabl over  e   it  sn   t mean we have to fix it and say we would never evolv beyond that   but if we know we   re go to adopt someth that   s go to be unstabl and subject to pressur to move  let   s tri to think through a bit in advanc how we   d anticip that pressur and respond to it   we can make the same point about the import of think through the sequenc of ani evolut   i take     s point about the import of be evolutionari in that respect   just as an exampl  if we decid that we want to go first with the transpar around our forecast befor consensus or clariti on a quantit object as public announc  we should be sure that we think that   s an op  chain of decis  too   so the question about sequenc are go to be import to work through   i have a bunch of comment on the initi propos for a narrat descript of our forecast and the way uncertainti is captur   but if the chairman permit  i will submit those direct to the staff for the record
certain   thank you veri much   let me thank the committe for yet anoth veri thought and help discuss   i appreci the  e you   ve spent prepar for this   thank also to the staff   i thought the background materi were excel   i   m not go to say much   i   m just go to make a coupl of comment   if we do adopt an object  it need to be consist with the dual mandat   that   s obvious and mean a coupl of thing   one is that the long run inflat rate would have to take into account  among other thing  the zero bound   i think that is an issu   i would not be comfort with a rang that involv have the inflat rate  say  below   percent a signific amount of the  e  stochast speak   so i think that   s a consider   second  becaus we have a dual mandat and becaus it   s an implic of op  monetari polici  the horizon has to be quit flexibl   is that meaningless   i don   t think so   in particular  if we begin to use the project more activ  the project would give a good bit of guidanc to the public about the  e it take to get back to the target rang   in particular  we could also  through our communic  discuss how the adjust period depend on initi condit  the state of the economi  and so on  i   m flexibl on the choic of index   i heard a lot of interest discuss today   i am somewhat attract to the headlin cpi   i do think that peopl understand it more   it appear in labor contract  for exampl  and in other wage discuss   it obvious appear in the tip and other place   so i think it   s worth consid   one possibl  choos a headlin cpi around   percent  would be reason consist with a   to   percent core pce in a sens becaus of the measur differ   but that   s an open question   i think it remain to be discuss   we have a lot to digest here  and we   re go to be think veri hard about all the comment we heard today  the subcommitte i know will tri to come up with some   don  i hope by tomorrow you   ll have a few    laughter   again this has been veri use  i   d like to just make one comment on the project  which again i think are potenti veri valuabl   this is about the assumpt of appropri monetari polici   the way that   s interpret now is that each person choos his or her own path for appropri monetari polici  and i think that some  lead to somewhat confus outcom   if you have someon  for exampl  who is pessimist about where inflat will actual go but who has a low inflat target and  therefor  has an appropri monetari polici that   s much more aggress than everyon els  he or she will report a good inflat outcom  and the press will report an op ist fed as far as where inflat is go to go   i would just like to put that out for consider  sinc we   re go to do sever dri run   by the way  i don   t anticip that we will be do this live for the juli monetari polici report   this will take a while  so don   t worri about that   one altern  which i believ i mention befor  would be for us to make an uncondit forecast  by which i mean that we would essenti be say     well  what do we think the committe is go to do     and condit on that  what we would expect the economi to deliv   that  i think  would probabl be easier for the public to understand than the way we do it now  with each person have his or her own condit polici assumpt   but i leav that for further discuss and for the staff also to think about  if there are no other comment  again  thank you   we will have lunch in the anteroom  and the next meet will be may     we are adjourn  end of meet
