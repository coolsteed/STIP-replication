i   d like to welcom presid   to the tabl
thank you veri much
welcom aboard   let   s start with the desk oper   mr  kos
thank you  mr  chairman   at your last meet i focus on the  higher level of volatil that was concentr in specif and fair narrow asset class  particular emerg market currenc and equiti   in the intermeet period  volatil declin in those asset class while stay low in a broader set of asset market such as fix incom and the major currenc pair   meanwhil  the market   s focus turn even more acut to the prospect that the committe would take a pass in rais rate at this meet  even as mani other central bank were tighten polici further   on the first page of the handout  the top panel graph the histor volatil of the msci equiti index for the unit state  europ  japan  and emerg market  these volatil rose after your may meet and peak around the  e of your june meet but have fallen back in recent week   emerg market equiti volatil  the blue line  declin sharpli from more than    percent to below    percent   on balanc  the valu of emerg market equiti and currenc rebound somewhat after the selloff in may and june   the middl left panel graph the vix index   although a tad higher than the veri low level observ earlier this year  the vix is well off it high and below it long term histor averag  similar  the middl right panel graph an index of volatil in treasuri yield  this index has been veri tame for sever quarter despit the wide report uncertainti about the futur direct of monetari polici   round out this benign pictur is the currenc market  as reflect in the bottom panel  where volatil briefli tick up in the spring but sinc then has quick fallen to earlier level   even though volatil on balanc trend lower sinc the last meet  trade  volum   as measur by the primari electron broker servic in fix incom and currenc market   declin more than can be explain by the summer doldrum   some market particip suggest that specul reduc risk in may and earli june and are now sit on their hand   in that scenario  risk appetit is still eb even if that is not show up in wider spread or higher volatil   if investor and specul are be more cautious  one reason for the caution might be relat to the tighten of monetari condit global   the tabl on  page   summar for a sampl of central bank the net chang in their main polici    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix            rate so far in        last thursday the bank of england surpris the market by increas rate    basi point  while the european central bank ratifi expect by also tighten    basi point   of particular note among central bank that have recent rais interest rate is the bank of japan  which on juli    move the target overnight call rate from   to    basi point  as shown in the bottom panel   the move had been well telegraph   nevertheless  the aggreg current account balanc at the boj is still higher than requir reserv of   trillion to   trillion yen   the main reason seem to be that japan post continu to hold high and variabl balanc  thus bump up the aggreg   while the backdrop global is toward tighter monetari condit  investor in the unit state have been look forward to a plateau of short term interest rate or even a declin over the medium term as hous and other indic have weaken   the prospect of a paus in the tighten cycl report help support equiti price  shown in the top panel on page    which inch higher as this meet approach   corpor profit on the s p     for q  have risen    percent  higher than analyst    forecast   in fact  profit have risen by doubl digit seventeen quarter in a row   with the prospect of a paus and strong profit  one might wonder whi the price action in equiti has been on the sloppi side   the most common answer is that the outlook that compani are provid is cautious  perhap suggest that the economi is soften more quick than previous forecast   continu on that theme  the middl panel graph the two year and ten year treasuri yield and the target fed fund rate   two year and ten year treasuri yield are down about    basi point  to about     percent  and rough    basi point below the fund rate   such an invers is common dure an eas cycl but veri rare dure a tighten cycl   as shown in the bottom panel  breakeven rate have bare budg sinc the last fomc meet   the entir declin in nomin yield repres a fall in real rate   taken at face valu  this suggest that investor may see lower real return ahead  perhap reflect a bearish view of the economi   howev  that bearish on the economi is not spill over to an expect that inflat will necessarili fall back    the top panel on page   graph the libor fix rate for three month deposit  the thick red line  and three   six   and nine month forward rate agreement   in recent day the nine month forward trade through the cash rate  suggest   if one take this liter   that the market are begin to contempl an eas of polici in earli        this pattern is similar but not ident to what we observ in       as shown in the middl panel   after the committe rais the fund rate in may         in what turn out to be the last move in the cycl   forward rate began to declin even though the committe continu with an asymmetr bias to tighten   by septemb the forward rate had pierc cash rate   anoth similar is seen with eurodollar futur calendar spread   the bottom left panel graph the differ between the decemb      and the decemb      eurodollar contract   late last year that spread turn negat  impli that market particip expect interest  rate to be lower at the end of      than at the end of        after revers somewhat  the spread turn sharpli downward in recent month   the bottom right     panel graph the spread between the decemb      and the decemb      contract from late      through septemb        the spread turn negat onli with anecdot report of a sharp drop in order around septemb  which was rough three month after the last tighten   shift gear  i want to mention briefli the transit on juli    to the new psr  payment system risk  polici   the first major p i  princip and interest  date under the new rule was juli      fanni mae had to fund     billion in mbs p i payment  net of payment to itself   and the transit went veri smooth   one of the tool that gses develop to help fund their account on a  e basi on larg p i date are term and overnight earli return of fed fund sale   under these contract  fed fund must be return to them earlier than the end of day deadlin associ with standard fed fund sale  usual between      a m  and    a m  rate on overnight earli return fed fund have trade rough   to   basi point below standard fed fund   base on incomplet sampl  about    percent of the volum of broker fed fund report to the desk and use to calcul the daili effect rate has been earli return   the desk is collect and monitor earli return fed fund data from the major broker to assess how this market develop and how earli return fed fund may affect the overal fed fund market   there were no foreign oper in the period  and i will need a vote to approv domest oper
thank you   the transit to the new psr polici is good news   are there ani question for mr  kos   if not  we need a motion to approv oper   so move  without object   we turn now to the econom situat   mr
thank you  mr  chairman   jack b hous  the voic of the chicago cub for more than thirti year  was more wide known for his knowledg of basebal than for his command of probabl   when a cub would step into the batter   s box after an especi long string of hitless trip to the plate  b hous would invari declar     he   s due      even we kid knew in our mind that jack didn   t have it quit right on the probabl front  but in our heart it was enough to keep us go   some of you may rememb that an employ report was releas on the friday after the june meet  and that  e  we pretti much nail it   so i have to admit to have had a    b hous moment    last friday and wonder whether we were    due    this  e for a real trainwreck   but for a second  e in a row  fate smile  as it so rare seem to do on macro forecast   so at the end of today   s meet  i   ll be happi to pass the baton back to dave   but with a certain sens of guilt   he   s realli due    laughter   in fact  as we report to the board ye day  friday   s labor market report came in veri much as expect   privat nonfarm payrol increas an es          in juli  virtual the same as the         we had been expect  and the gain in      each of the previous two month were revis up by a modest          the unemploy rate round up to     percent  but unless we receiv addit evid of a more rapid slacken of condit in the labor market  we   re inclin to stick with our  book trajectori for the unemploy rate as well   overal  we made no materi adjust to our macro forecast in light of this news on the labor market   inde  i would argu that there was less news in the august  book than met the eye   the quick summari of the august project is that the pressur on resourc util look rough the same to us as they did at the  e of the june  book  wherea the outlook for inflat look just a shade wors   turn first to the issu of resourc util  the clearest indic of our think in this regard is that the unemploy rate in the august  book never deviat more than     percentag point from our forecast in the june  book   to put a veri fine line on the matter  we nudg the path down ever so slight over most of the forecast period  and that call still look about right to us  even in the wake of friday   s report   given an unrevis es  of the nairu  the slight lower level of the unemploy rate impli that the pressur on resourc util are just a littl greater in this  book than they were in the last one   at the same  e  we have becom a bit more pessimist about the outlook for the growth of aggreg demand relat to potenti over the next six quarter   this slight greater pessim deriv from sever consider   most notabl  start and especi permit for the construct of singl famili home came in below our expect in june  and we respond by take our project for residenti construct down over the entir project period   in the june  book  our project ran abov the simul trajectori from our prefer model for start  in recognit of the persist upsid error that model had been make   now  for what it   s worth  our judgment forecast happen to be in line with the simul from that model that jump off from the last quarter of data   parenthet  i might note that the simul from that model did not revis great over the past six week   we still see the contract in residenti construct as moder by histor standard but like to be a littl steeper than we anticip in june   this  e  we forecast that singl famili start will bottom out at an annual rate of      million unit  bring the overal declin from last summer   s peak to    percent  still well shi of the declin that were regist in the earli     s and earli     s but start to be in the same ballpark   we also took on board the growth implic of the further run up in oil price sinc the june meet  the somewhat lower level of household wealth impli by the downward revis trajectori for hous price  and the likelihood that greater inventori invest in the second quarter rob a smidgen of growth from the futur   all that said  the adjust to our forecast of resourc util are pretti margin   more eye catch were our revis to top line gdp growth  which averag     percentag point over the second half of this year and     percentag point next year   but here  of cours  the chang were driven by the adjust we made to the suppli side of our project   in it annual revis of the nation     incom and product account  the bea trim the averag pace of growth of real gdp from      through      about     percentag point   becaus our fundament view of the pressur on resourc util and the rate of inflat were unchang by the nipa revis  the simplest thing for us to do would have been to take potenti gdp down by a like size amount  therebi keep the gdp gap the same  as befor   as we often do  howev  we made a further adjust to potenti in order to bring the output gap into line with the unemploy rate gap at the end of last year therebi elimin a tension between those two    gap    variabl that had becom more distract than inform   as for the forecast  in line with our usual practic  we overlaid the other factor that i discuss earlier with a     percentag point adjust for the reduct in the growth of potenti  on the theori that household and busi anchor their spend plan around their longer term  prospect for incom   a central issu that we wrestl with in this forecast round was whether the slowdown in growth that we anticip will materi to the degre that we expect  the dimens of that slowdown are signific   look ahead six quarter and behind by the same amount help smooth through some of the quarter to quarter wiggl   we es  that  over the past six quarter  real gdp growth exceed potenti growth  on averag  about   percentag point at an annual rate  we expect real gdp growth over the next six quarter to fall short of potenti by rough the same amount   one key factor drive this swing in our forecast is the combin of a wane boost to consumpt from household net worth and the higher level of interest rate   the result is reflect in our forecast for the person save rate  again use the same six quarter window  fore and aft  over the past six quarter  the save rate declin more than   percentag point  we expect that between now and the end of      the smaller gain in wealth and higher interest rate will bring the save rate back up to   percent   anoth key factor  especi in the near term  is the slowdown in residenti invest   after chip onli about   percentag point from the growth of real gdp dure the first half of this year  residenti invest is expect to slice about   percentag point from the growth of real gdp over the second half of this year   next year  the drag from this sector should have diminish but not halt altogeth   final  we think that the sum of public and privat spend relat to last year   s hurrican will top out some  this year and will begin to drift down  accentu the downdraft from the other factor weigh on demand   we have assum that  within the aggreg of total hurrican spend  govern spend and the replac of destroy equip have been relat front load  wherea construct activ  we presum  is still ramp up   turn to inflat  the news is relat slight but not of the welcom varieti  as you know from the  book  we mark up our project for core pce inflat over the second half of this year about   percentag point and nudg the forecast for next year up a tenth   the largest singl factor account for these upward revis was the further deterior dure the intermeet period in the outlook for energi price  the pass through of these price add about a tenth to our project of core inflat dure the second half of this year and about half a tenth     next year   owner    equival rent surpris us onc again to the upsid in the most recent cpi releas  and we extend forward some of that unfavor news   other sourc of upward revis  each small but togeth big enough to generat just a littl upward nudg to our project  includ slight higher near term core import price and slight weaker structur product growth   as befor  we continu to see core inflat step down next year compar with this year  almost entir becaus of the flatten out we have project for energi and other commod price   we have the increas in those price ad about     percentag point to our forecast of core pce inflat this year  and we have them ad just     percentag point next year   provid that this year   s shock do not get built into inflat expect go forward  this remov of  upward impetus should be enough to give core inflat a downward tilt   in close  i might briefli mention that    speed effect    do not play an import role in shape our outlook for inflat   the slowdown in growth oper first by bring output down from abov potenti to right in line with potenti by some  dure the first half of next year and then by move output below potenti over the remaind of        for      as a whole  output is so close to potenti as to be rough a neutral factor for inflat   if growth were to proceed at a subpar pace into       the result gap in resourc util could begin to place some downward pressur on inflat     will now continu our present
from the perspect of the global economi  one of the import revis in this forecast from last  e is the project path for crude oil price   we have incorpor into the baselin forecast a path for both west texa intermedi  wti  price and the u s  oil import price that is more than    per barrel higher in the fourth quarter of this year and near    higher by the fourth quarter of next year than was the case in the june  book   it is still true  howev  that the project path  base as usual on market futur price at the  e the forecast was made final  is quit flat   the sizabl jump in oil price this  e reflect the volatil that we have seen in market price for oil sinc late june  when the previous  book was be final   spot price for wti move from below     per barrel at that  e to a recent peak of     in mid juli and again ye day  follow bp   s announc that pipelin repair in alaska will shut in about         barrel per day of crude oil  price fluctuat dure the intermeet period reflect market concern about the potenti effect on suppli of ongo event in the middl east  some disrupt to product in nigeria  and a slight reduct in output by saudi arabia  as well as an awar that hurrican season has arriv   no doubt the under strength of the global economi is contribut by maintain overal demand as well   as of close of busi ye day  the futur path for wti oil price dure the remaind of this year and next year was about    per barrel abov the  book baselin path  clear  further move in oil price are a risk to the forecast        anoth import element in the foreign outlook is the continu elev level of nonfuel commod price  especi the industri metal   metal price are down from their high in may  but they are also up from their near term low in june  dure the intermeet period  spot price for copper and zinc rose through mid juli and then partial revers their recent increas but sinc have move up again   on balanc  metal price are modest higher sinc the  e of the june  book  but price of other primari commod are somewhat lower   as a result  our project path for nonfuel commod price in this forecast is veri similar to that of last  e  the elev level of these price mean that they will continu to have lag effect on u s  import and export price inflat for a  e   the flat of the path go forward mean that we anticip that the implic for import price inflat will abat notic in       contribut to a sharp drop in the rate of inflat for core import   further fluctuat in the price for these global commod is also a risk to our baselin forecast   these develop in global commod price  both fuel and nonfuel  along with other data releas over the intermeet period  led us to revis up some our forecast for inflat abroad through mid        we expect that the upward pressur on inflat in the industri countri will be felt in the near term  particular this quarter  wherea those in the emerg market economi will be evid later this year and into next   the revis are small  in part becaus foreign industri countri have to date been veri success at contain the inflat consequ of higher crude oil price and sever have tighten monetari polici and in part becaus emerg market economi have continu to suppress domest energi price  delay their effect in the process   some monetari polici tighten has also been implement by a number of asian central bank   we continu to read the evid for foreign real gdp growth as indic a solid pace of expans  with the possibl except of canada  where output growth slow in the second quarter   we have fine tune our outlook for expans abroad a bit   strengthen last quarter and this quarter and lessen the pace just a littl next year  but the overal path for foreign real gdp is about the same as in june  indic from most of our import trade partner   for exampl  from japan  the euro area  and china   suggest consider momentum in foreign econom expans at the present  e   global financi market confirm a general favor climat for continu strong growth  and mani of the sign of increas risk concern and heighten volatil from earlier in the year have fade   over the intermeet period  stock price in mani of our trade partner have risen   equiti price index in emerg market countri  in particular  have rebound from the low of mid june but general have not return to the level reach in earli may   other than in the unit kingdom and japan  yield on ten year sovereign bond have move down    or more basi point in the major foreign industri countri sinc your june meet  and spread on dollar denomin emerg market sovereign debt have partial retrac previous increas and are not far abov the low observ in earli      may  with the except of spread for turkish debt   on balanc  the dollar is down just a littl over the period   the bottom line is that the staff   s pictur of the global economi impli an essenti neutral effect of the extern sector on u s  gdp growth over the forecast period  although one must rememb that there are risk on both side to that pictur  the arithmet contribut of real net export to gdp growth for the rest of this year and next year is essenti zero   with a small posit contribut over the second half of this year  unusu for us  follow by a small negat contribut in      as a whole   export of both good and servic are expect to grow strong  support by steadi expans of real gdp growth abroad   the step down in u s  real gdp growth should restrain import growth somewhat over the next six quarter   the nomin trade deficit on good and servic is project to widen about     billion from the es  figur for the second quarter to that for the fourth quarter of        the chang in the non oil nomin trade balanc account for onli one third of that     billion   this chang in the overal trade balanc is suffici small that the project ratio of the trade deficit to gdp is steadi at about   percent  nevertheless  the current account deficit is project to exceed    trillion at the end of       and the ratio of the current account deficit to gdp rise from     percent to   percent next year   a grow net deficit in invest incom flow larg explain the further deterior in the current account balanc   that chang  in turn  is account for by a substanti widen of the deficit on portfolio incom that more than offset a gain in the balanc of direct invest incom   the financ requir of our extern deficit remain larg and will continu to grow as long as   the level of the trade balanc remain far from zero     and i will be happi to answer ani question
thank you veri much   are there question for   or     presid pool
i   d like to put a question to you  but i want to do it in the form of an observ that i   d like you to comment on   it has to do with the inflat situat   obvious  we are not in a situat anyth remot like that of the     s  but i do believ that we have veri general inflat across sector and across region of the world   let me support that statement in the follow way   in the overal number  the core pce is at or abov   percent    or was in       and       and is project for       and         so this number is for a four year period    it   s not a littl flash in the pan   the inflat project abroad have been shade up   i think     you comment explicit to that effect   import and export price are be revis up a bit   the revis are not huge  but they are all in the same direct   dollar depreci would tend to promot higher price   i   ve look at the disaggreg cpi for the twelv month end in june of this year  versus the twelv month end in june        so it   s a year over year comparison   when we look at the compon   i won   t go through all of them   we know what   s happen to owner    equival rent   we know what is happen to the energi part of it   household furnish and oper are up  apparel is up   the major thing go down are actual new vehicl and use vehicl  which are tend to hold the cpi down   public transport is up  medic care commod are up  and there is a veri small declin in medic care servic   other good and servic  communic  and recreat are all up   educ is up just a bit   the upward revis is veri general across almost all sector of the cpi   then  on the cost side  we   re go to have this big upward revis in unit labor cost   by the way  were the unit labor cost releas this morn          they should have been releas by       i think
mayb we   ll see what happen there dure the break   my argument is that we have veri general inflat pressur across region of the world and across commod and servic sector   the pressur is not isol   could you comment on that observ
broad  i don   t disagre that the acceler in consum price is broad base   it is sensit to sampl period   michael kiley   s brief ye day to the board touch on some of the same issu and present an exhibit that display the median cpi as construct by the feder reserv bank of cleveland and the trim mean construct by the     feder reserv bank of dalla   both of those measur  which are altern attempt to  captur the central tendenc of inflat rate  have also move up notabl  most of all from        i guess i would remind you that we were a littl puzzl as to whi inflat was as low as it was in        it fell below our model simul   we have never been abl to come up with a fulli satisfactori explan for whi it got as low as it did   so if you use      as your base for comparison with the present  the trend look veri worrisom   if you smooth through that   i don   t know that    anomali    is the right word   unexplain dip in       you are left with a trend that by ani of these measur has move up   the particular comparison that we chose to highlight ye day in the brief to the board emphas the acceler in hous servic  but other compon have play a role as well   we also think that the energi price pass through into core has play a broad diffus role in give some upward impetus to core  inflat
if i could just comment on the worldwid aspect of your point  i   d say that the one piec that   s miss is that global we have not seen this inflat pressur translat into an acceler in wage and labor compens   not so much here in the unit state and not in rest of the world   even in place where central bank are tighten monetari polici in recognit of the inflat that they are experienc in their consum price  one is not hear stori about an acceler of wage   so there   s truth in everyth you   ve said  and i wouldn   t disagre that it   s worrisom  but we   ve seen huge chang in the structur of global econom activ   those chang may have effect signific chang in relat price  particular of energi on the one hand and of  other kind of primari commod on the other   we keep say that those price chang are go to end  right   everi fomc i come here  and i tell you that those price are flatten out     start this morn    laughter   then i come back six week later  and i say it again   and that   s not lost on me   howev  there is a question in my mind as to trend versus relat price effect here  and i think there are sure some of both type of effect   it may be wrong to attribut the pressur entir to a relat price shock that   s go to go away immedi  but it   s certain also wrong to call it all inflat trend with no relat price compon
now that i   ve had a chanc to take a breath   anoth factor that obvious is critic is the behavior of inflat expect   as you know  the survey of profession forecast long term measur has been flat  immov  at     percent   the univers of michigan survey   which we show in the  book tabl back to        was at     percent  on the median measur  in the second half of       and it is at     percent in june and juli of this year   so long term inflat expect have realli been remark well contain   shorter term inflat expect have fluctuat more with chang in overal consum price  and they are up a coupl of tenth from the end of        but there hasn   t been a lot of upward drift in measur of inflat expect
presid pool ask a signific part of my question  or he present a signific part of my question    laughter   but let me ask you about the markup part of this  you know  we have alway thought that there was a cushion for compens to go higher  for input cost to go higher  and for profit margin to shrink  and therefor we wouldn   t get ani pass through into price increas   those markup have remain incred high   i mean  profit margin are veri high   i was just wonder whether you think we should put less weight on this     factor go forward when we   re look at our forecast  given what we   ve seen in unit labor cost  which you mention  and other chang in the forecast
so  they revis down   the implic of the nipa revis is that  accord to the latest es   those markup are a littl lower than they were befor   they are still notic abov their histor averag   in the judgment forecast  we have never place an enorm amount of weight on those markup measur  and perhap the chain of event dure this intermeet period illustr whi   our frb us model   put a lot of weight on those markup  and it revis up it inflat project     percentag point   someth like that   now it   s within spit distanc of the judgment forecast   first of all  we have had a hard  e get those markup to enter reliabl or robust into an econometr equat   second  we   ve been leeri of the kind of revis that took place in this year   s nipa revis   we   ve certain regard them with some nervous and refer to  them as present a downsid risk to inflat  if those profit margin should compress   but i   m not entir sure how to respond to your question as to whether we should put less weight on them sinc we haven   t put an enorm amount of weight on them in our judgment project to date   they are a secondari determin of our inflat outlook in the judgment project   as i say  to the extent that you were prepar to put some weight on them befor and to see them as high befor  you would still see them as high now  though less so
and the unit labor cost trend hasn   t caus you to chang your outlook for the futur either
again  the statist analysi is veri frustrat   it   s hard to get that variabl to enter reliabl  particular with real  e data that are suscept to the kind of revis that we have seen   we do put a nod in our inflat forecast to the acceler in     structur product  which is relat to unit labor cost  but unit labor cost themselv have likewis not play a promin role in our judgment forecast
thank you   presid
thank you   i have a question for   and    and it pick up on presid pool   s   my question has to do with what  if anyth  we can learn about the role of energi price increas as a factor rais core inflat here from the experi of other countri   sinc we   re not the onli countri experienc increas in energi and other commod price  my question is whether or not there is some econometr or other evid that pertain to the degre of energi price pass through into core inflat in other develop economi   i   m think particular of economi in which inflat expect are reason well anchor   for exampl  the unit kingdom  canada  and the euro area   what do we know about energi price pass through into core inflat   is there evid of that
i suspect that there is  but i confess that i   m not realli abl to give you the detail this morn   we have not attempt to do a major project of that sort   there are two thing that have to be immedi taken into account if you   re think about some kind of cross countri  or at least non u s   look at this   first are the tax featur   mani of the other industri countri have specif tax  much higher specif tax  on fuel product of one sort or anoth  particular on gasolin but also on other thing   those economi will experi a much smaller percentag chang in the wholesal and retail price for ani given chang in the crude oil price than we will   the shock is alway damp by that on the upsid but also on the  downsid  of cours   so that   s a factor that we point to often  and that is whi ocular regress kind of pass through would make you think that pass through is less abroad       second is the exchang rate effect   if the dollar is trend down a bit  for a short  e  anyway  it need to be taken care of in the dynam of the equat rather than in the structur of the equat becaus we believ that the dollar oil price adjust to global demand and suppli  but for short episod in particular  if one thought the dollar was experienc a spike or a this or a that  then obvious the chang in the exchang valu of the dollar look to other countri as a piec of how much oil price have gone up for them   in general  mani countri   say  japan and  for that matter  even europ   have a sens that overal the effect is less becaus their energi intens is less   they are constant lectur us that we consum too much energi  whether  ceteri paribus  the actual paramet in term of the price shock realli differ i can   t tell you  but the specif tax and the consequ reduct in energi intens that they have help  to produc  and other factor that have made them less energi intens  do make the problem seem to be smaller in most of the other industri countri
in your open comment you said that the staff got the last two employ number right   but they were below the market expect of what the employ number would be   in the  book baselin project  the employ growth number go forward are even lower   they are        per month for the rest of this year and        per month in        those seem like veri low number  i think that  if those number are realiz  they   re go to continu to surpris market and to appear pretti weak    so i was wonder how sensit to those specif employ number the outlook is   i know that the  book has a lower nairu altern simul  is that suppos to be provid us with some inform about the uncertainti in that forecast   given that lower nairu altern in     the  book  i am also curious about what kind of employ number we are look at that would achiev those outcom
the predomin factor in generat those strike low employ gain is our project for trend labor forc particip over the project period   with the age of the workforc  we think that the trend is now turn decid downward  not for cyclic reason  not becaus the labor market present atyp unapp job opportun  but becaus an increas share of the popul is shift into age group that have histor exhibit lower labor forc particip rate   my recollect is that the differ between a flat particip rate and a declin particip rate   and i   ll look it up here if i can find it fast enough for you   is on the order of about        job per month   we have a neutral privat payrol gain for the remaind of this year in the neighborhood of about        job   if the particip rate were to remain flat         to        job would be ad to our trend es    we think that the declin in labor forc particip is take about     percentag point off the growth of hour over the project period   now  if that were to flatten out  if we simpli have the trend wrong  then that would play through the macro forecast   i   m go to do someth danger here and think out loud   a lot like the adjust to potenti gdp that we just made follow the nipa revis   in essenc  a flat particip rate would mean that trend hour growth is that much fa  and that trend aggreg demand     percentag point fa  could be sustain without generat addit inflat pressur
i have a follow on question to sandi   s   i know how the benchmark gdp revis work into your forecast   but if you look just at the headlin number  we seem to     have the worst of all circumst for a central bank   a good deal slower growth for a number of reason   the benchmark be one of them   even though all the output gap and everyth els remain relat the same  slower headlin growth in both gdp and consumpt  and  higher inflat   this is not an easi set of circumst by ani mean   one thing i am concern about  like sandi  is the speed with which you have consum react in their  consumpt to potenti gdp chang   you haven   t chang the save rate that much from your earlier forecast  but you do get the     percentag point out of gdp growth   i was just wonder about your thought on that   the reaction seem fast   second  outsid of a  recess  have we ever seen this kind of declin in real estat invest in a period of growth  we were tri to find it  but it   s hard to sort through caus and effect here   the declin seem veri larg in term of the negat real estat invest   final    mention that we haven   t seen wage inflat or wage growth outstrip product here or in major countri anywher els in the world   i   m wonder  given all the focus on the fact that median famili incom are not grow on a real basi  whether there is at least some chanc that we   re go to start see an increas return  particular for skill peopl  which everybodi tell you they can   t find
let me take those concern in turn   first  with regard to the speed of  adjust of consumpt to potenti gdp   perhap it is iron  but our assumpt is that we are the most ignor one in this littl moral play  that household and busi have been awar of the slower growth of potenti gdp  and that  as far as household and busi are concern  what goe on in the basement of the bea is utter without consequ   you can see that as well  for exampl  in our leav the stock market project unrevis   implicit in the way we have react to the news from the bea is that household and busi knew of the slower trajectori       investor knew of the slower trajectori for potenti gdp   it was we who were off in previous  assum an erron steep upward trend for potenti gdp   it   chang the error pattern   the pattern of error over histori is chang a bit  and at the margin  that send us into the  project period with slight differ dynam  but those are veri small effect    sandi is alert me that an import piec of news that we receiv was the weak of dispos  incom growth in the second quarter
but you still have it grow pretti fast over the forecast period      percent or so
yes  inde  fa  than spend  and that   s how we generat the upward motion of the person save rate
the way that chang is sort of speedi  too  but that was in your previous forecast
now  let   s see   i can   t read my own note   the second question is
just a real estat invest question
oh  have we seen anyth like this outsid of a recess   i don   t know  the answer to that   i would mention  howev  how strong residenti invest was through the recess and how well sustain it was and how we all remark on the strength with which that  sector persist through that period of veri low interest rate   everi busi cycl is differ from everi other one  but this one certain has it uniqu featur  which is the uncharacterist strength of residenti invest through the recess period  and we have that come off now   third  you ask about growth in real compens or real wage   we have some acceler in our project   we expect it to occur   we expect it to be consist with a moder profil of price inflat   we do see labor   s share of incom as lower now than it will     be in some equilibrium point in the futur  so we expect that aspect of nation incom to shift in it composit
just a quick question for        look at the global economi as a whole  would you say that capac util has increas sinc we last met  sinc the end of the   last quarter  or sinc the begin of the year and  if so  to a signific degre
i would say in a kind of notion sens that most especi china  for exampl  has not slow to the degre that we and everybodi els had been expect   there was a  signific posit surpris in the q  number for china   at the  e we saw what we call the    volatil    of may june  when it look as though some commod price were come off and the stori that they had been held up by specul and so forth seem true  and it look as  though those price might actual adjust downward and stay down   well  that percept was veri short live   the fundament demand for some of these product seem to have reassert itself    and mani of those price are back up where they onc were   so base on those kind of indirect signal  i would say that the strength of the global economi is at least what it was three month ago and perhap a tini bit stronger
is that net of our weak or our declin   this is just guess work  but i am curious
if the full trajectori go through the rest of this year that is in the  book take place  then the unit state is go to take the world back just a bit  and it will bring canada with it probabl   at least that is what our forecast say will happen   we see china     step harder on the mechan that it use to tri to slow it economi   in some sens  i would say that the  book pictur we   re paint is that global capac util is perhap at a peak right about now and that we anticip the slow in the unit state and the effort in china certain to outweigh the continu strength  say  in europ or japan  which is probabl go to happen   still in all  that may be the mean of our forecast  but there   s a distribut around that  and it   s certain possibl that there are upsid risk as well as downsid risk in those capac pressur
ani other question
may i just briefli mention the staff view   our research on structur labor  forc particip is laid out in a brook paper that is just about due for releas by folk who are our labor specialist   that paper set out in consider detail our work in this area
thank you   we are readi for our econom outlook go round   for presid     s benefit  i will say that we have two go round   the first is on the econom outlook  and the second is on polici issu   one hand mean you want to be recogn  and michell will put your name on the list   if you want to interject a question or a comment  we have two hand intervent   who would like to go first   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the seventh district moder in the second quarter in line with our expect after a veri strong first quarter   most of my director and busi contact believ that ad caution is take hold in the economi   some think that growth will be notic slower in the second half of the year  and some believ that slow will continu into        howev  my contact are unabl to point to explicit exampl  apart from hous  show that such a mark deceler     current is in train   inde  mani of the report that we get are quit upbeat   for instanc  one of our nation temporari help contact said his indic were point to a bounceback from a weak second quarter  and he was see strong convers from temporari to perman status   one reason that some peopl were more pessimist was that they believ the current expans is a bit  as they say  long in the tooth  and so the economi must be due for a period of  weak   of cours  the econom literatur find that the probabl of an expans   s end   not depend on the expans   s current length   howev  these comment could reflect imbal in the economi that increas exposur to advers shock   but except for hous  ani refer to such imbal are vagu at best   although it is not certain  the mixtur of report may simpli be indic of the normal process of the economi   s moder to growth averag near or a bit below potenti   on the inflat front  we continu to hear report of cost pass through and other price increas similar to those we   ve receiv in recent month   turn to the nation outlook  although growth moder in the second quarter  gdp  growth for the first half was a solid   percent   the unemploy rate remain below   percent  and the core pce inflat rate has now been at or abov   percent for more than two year   it has to be said  in look simpli at the top line data that form the basi of most taylor rule  that real activ is pretti good and inflat is too high   in this context  three relat question guid my think on the outlook   first  are there import imbal within particular sector that should concern us   second  is the list of exogen downsid shock accumul to a point that the risk to growth outweigh those from deterior inflat   third  are the current financi condit restrict or not    regard sector imbal  for some  e we have assum a mark slowdown in residenti invest  but other sector do not seem to be outsid normal rang of variat     associ with an economi that is grow close to potenti   busi fix invest last quarter was weaker than we had thought  but the weak appear to larg reflect transitori develop in volatil categori   communic equip and transport  import  we don   t hear ani stori of pull back due to earlier overinvest   on the household side  the steadi growth in the consumpt of nondur and servic indic that  household do not seem to be over concern about their longer term prospect for incom growth   so for now  i do not see ani sector imbal that would pile on the hous adjust and caus a more fundament downshift in econom growth over the forecast period   what about shock   well  the list of downsid shock is troublesom   energi price continu to surpris us on the upsid   geopolit risk have increas  particular consid develop in the middl east   we now have some sens from busi that anim spirit may be make them more cautious   current  howev  i think that this is more rhetor than action   still i think that all these factor deserv care monitor   third  what about financi condit   when i was prepar for this meet  i talk to no one who thought that condit are restrict   the modal respons continu to be that financ is readili avail and is fuel a lot of dealmak   ten year treasuri rate are under   percent   risk spread are low   if we want to assess the constrain effect of past increas in the feder fund rate  we need to take into account the level of interest rate   in all likelihood  the real fund rate has onli recent reach neutral   furthermor  we need to consid the accommod that we had put in place in      and        the core pce inflat data we now have for that period are about    percentag point higher than what we saw in the real  e initi announc inflat rate that guid our polici decis back then   so the     unwelcom disinfl of      was not as sever as we had fear at the  e  and accord  our polici was more accommod than we thought at the  e  which may have had inflationari consequ   the incom data make the current inflat situat seem much more troublesom   first  as we all know  the latest read on core pce inflat is     percent  that   s pretti high   second  the revis nipa data indic that core pce inflat has been at or abov   percent sinc april       as presid pool mention   the combin of these two fact make me more concern that inflat expect may soon begin to drift up   final  i don   t see the forc in play that would make the polici assumpt in the  book restrict enough to put core inflat on a downward trajectori over the next    month   if the pass through was small on the way up  it seem like to be small on the way down  and output gap that might be emerg will not alter inflat   s trajectori veri much or veri quick with flat es  of phillip curv
thank you  mr  chairman   so far the economi has stuck pretti close to the script of the soft land sketch out in the june  book   real gdp growth slow mark in the second quarter   hous construct has declin sharpli  and hous price have deceler  this situat suggest that our polici action have taken hold in this interest sensit sector   the recent sharp rise in oil price should also put a damper on growth of real incom and consum spend   most forecast now expect below trend growth in the current quarter   nonfarm payrol employ has shift down to a more sustain pace  and the unemploy rate has risen to     percent  just a bit below standard es  of the nairu   core inflat  although uncomfort high  came in     percentag point below the june  book   s forecast in the second quarter   in addit  despit further larg increas in     the price of oil  inflat expect held firm   in light of these develop  a reason forecast is for growth to continu to run slight below it potenti rate  the unemploy rate to edg up  and core inflat to reced gradual   at our last meet  i laid out some of my concern about downsid risk to the outlook for growth and upsid risk to inflat   quit honest  i cannot say that the recent data have done much to assuag my angst on either account   the recent falloff in hous activ and the deceler in hous price have been fa  than expect   the current  book has residenti invest fall at an annual rate of    percent in the second half of this year  near twice as fast as project in june   these surpris intensifi the risk of a sharper slowdown as the lag effect of our past polici action come fulli into effect   for exampl  the hous slowdown could becom an unwelcom hous slump as envis in one of the  book altern scenario   a larg homebuild in our district summar the view of mani of our contact when he recent comment that    the hous market has not yet pop  but a hiss sound is now clear audibl       laughter   he point to rapid rise cancel as a particular omin sign   i will be watch the incom data close for sign as to whether the hous slowdown remain order as hope or take a steeper downward slide  pose a greater risk to the economi   my concern about inflat have also been somewhat heighten by the recent data or  more precis  revis to past data   core measur of inflat continu to be well abov my comfort zone   of cours  after the experi of last year  when core inflat was revis up by a consider amount  i approach this year   s annual nipa revis with some consider trepid   i was reliev to see that the core pce price inflat data came out of the revis relat unscath  revis up just     percentag point for       but other aspect of the report     were somewhat less reassur for the inflat outlook   first  the rate of labor product growth over the past three year has been a bit slower than we thought  primarili becaus of downward revis to the rate of capit accumul  so that the  book now project structur product growth of     percent  about   percentag point slower than we thought back in june   this revis suggest somewhat less downward pressur on inflat eman from cost reduct and  therefor  greater upsid risk to inflat   but that wasn   t the onli surpris tuck away in the annual revis   the upward revis to compens growth over the past four quarter impli that growth in unit labor cost over the past year has been more rapid than we had believ   i had thought that there was a good chanc that compens per hour and unit labor cost would increas relat moder go forward  help to contain inflationari pressur   the data revis was thus a bit of a wake up call for me  and i have revis upward my view on the outlook for compens and unit labor cost   my read of the report is that the revis data provid a clearer and less sanguin pictur of the trend in this measur of compens   howev  the employ cost index was in line with expect in june and continu to show moder growth   moreov  even with revis to product and compens  the markup in the nonfarm busi sector remain veri high by histor standard  suggest that firm do have room to absorb cost   overal  i view the inflat outlook as high uncertain  with a pronounc upsid risk  as i mention at the last meet  we just don   t have a good handl on whi core inflat has risen of late or how persist this rise will be   while it is comfort to attribut the increas to energi and commod price pass through  empir evid suggest that pass through effect     have been quit modest sinc the mid     s   if so  the door is open for other explan that may have a more last influenc and requir a more aggress polici respons   someth that make me even more uncertain about the inflat outlook is that standard backward look phillip curv model of inflat appear to be break down   it has been wide note that the es  effect of resourc util on inflat in such model has becom much smaller over  e   but equal strike is the find that the sum of coeffici on lag inflat when freeli es  appear to have fallen as well  suggest that inflat has becom far less persist   in fact  our staff find that  in look over the past ten year  it is better to assum that core inflat will return to it sampl averag over the next four quarter than that it will remain in it recent rang or follow a standard phillip curv model   interest  this declin in the persist of core inflat has occur at rough the same  e that long run inflat expect  as measur by the survey of profession forecast  appear to have becom well anchor  and this may not be a coincid   econom model with forward look inflat expect tell us that  if the central bank has credibl and hold to a fix long run inflat target  then inflat will be less persist than is impli by the standard backward look phillip curv model   inde  the puzzl for macroeconomist has been whi we see so much inflat persist   perhap we no longer do   if that is true  inflat may declin fa  than the  book expect   admit  the past ten year form a relat small sampl from which to draw definit conclus   but the inflat process may have chang in a fundament way  and we should be open to that possibl   i would like to stress that this evid and the analysi concern the simpl correl of the inflat data that are use for forecast   the evid   not relat to structur relationship  and therefor it   not necessarili inform us about     how our polici decis affect the economi or about the best cours for polici   in summari  although my modal forecast is relat benign  i remain veri concern about risk to both growth and inflat
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  at our last fomc meet in my now over one year long attempt to stay away from ani analog refer to inning or basebal  laughter   i use the analog of phil mickelson at the u s  open to suggest an opposit strategi   what i suggest was that we use the minut we are about to releas and especi your tes oni  if you recal  to center the ball on the fairway so that we could approach the   from the point of this meet   it appear now that we have done that  you have done that  and the minut have done that  and we are basic at a point where we are confid of either a hawkish paus or one  more tighten of the screw in term of rais the feder fund rate   the  book and the bluebook do a good job of present us with an analyt framework for this meet   i want to compliment them  with an    i     but i also thought it might be help to complement them  with an    e     with some of the data and input from our busi contact and the work of our own research staff on the issu we have been talk about   let me start with hous   i regular talk to ceo of two of the five big builder   they like use analog   in the word of the second largest builder in the countri     the pig is still in the python      that is  he expect the declin from peak to trough in home sale to exceed that forecast in the  book   i think we had      percent  he is talk about a correct of    percent   to adher to the convent of report on my district  which we are suppos to do  i   m happi to say that onli texa  where our economi is on the verg of employ ten million worker  is hold up in the book of these two homebuild   even the  ina are     start to fold over  and the weakest area is california   the big five builder and other homebuild are react as you might expect   they are cut staff   they are renegoti their price and get concess from their subcontractor   they are walk away from their plan land deal  and they are renegoti exist contract   this is what a macroeconomist would expect in reaction   in answer to cathi   s and     s question  one ceo  who has been in the busi sinc       report that this correct is the roughest and most sudden he has seen  with one except   that except is that the industri is signific consolid  with most of the big builder either support veri strong balanc sheet or have readi access to capit from a flush bank system and eager privat equiti group   so the report i receiv from the big five are that  while they are wring their hand  they   re also lick their chop  they are plot acquisit of smaller  weaker builder when they reach the depth of despair   this situat may signal the prospect of a shorter turnaround  e for a correct  or it may not  but i just throw it out for your contempl   clear  howev  the hous downturn and the cumul effect of energi and electr price increas are have an effect   one of my contact is the ceo of a larg    casual dine    restaur chain  which employ         out of the     million peopl employ in that segment of the restaur busi   he report that his util cost this year have risen    percent and his materi cost have risen    percent   although custom are move downscal in term of the dine chain  guest count for that segment of the market  which again employ     million peopl  are down   percent in the last week  and he see that trend continu   the ceo of a nation middl price point retail report that furnitur sale in juli were down    percent   a low end price point retail   the low end price point be wal mart     to   eleven   report slow traffic   in the word of the head of wal mart usa    menzer     what we saw last month is get wors      so call morn mad sale  which are common in septemb  have been move up to juli and august   the railroad report a signific slowdown over the past four week in the shipment of forest product   so we do have a slowdown  although it is import to point out that the rail  accord to the compani themselv  expect to increas traffic   percent dure the second half becaus of industri demand   up report through it cfo that it is ship      million packag a day  which is down from about      in the first half but up from      in        incident  their report last quarter prove to be remark accur in term of their expect growth for the second quarter  if it  in turn  is revis upward toward   percent   so i want to stick with what i report at the june fomc meet   that our    road     economi has downshift in growth   i also report a sens that inflat pressur gaug needl were move forward  and my sound this  e indic that they continu to do so   i thought that the brief the staff gave to the board and circul to us was veri help  and i appreci veri much the discuss we had earlier on inflat in answer to presid pool   s question   it is import to point out that the month trim mean pce inflat rate in june was     percent   on a twelv month basi  it pick up to     percent   but veri import   if  as presid pool suggest  you break down the pce compon  whether you trim it or you use it    fulli garb     laughter       percent of the compon are increas in price   that is up from    percent in april   what that mean is that onli    percent of price are fall compar with    percent two month ago       we know that inflationari pressur are build abroad      our work in dalla is veri much in it infanc  but to the extent that it help  our measur of industri capac util in all the larg member state of the european union is up   recent revis to the unit kingdom   s nation account indic that the brit are oper closer to capac  and if you look at the tankan survey  for the first  e in more than a decad  japan is report capac constraint   like everybodi els  we have no reliabl data on china and india  but we know that their economi are steam along   as they grow  they cut into exist global  capac avail to u s  busi   let me give you an exampl   our ship ceo report that a portion of the intern fleet of larg bulk carrier  although they es  that this portion is onli about   percent  has now been rerout and is be use for intracoast  intra chines trade   so at a  e of the year when usual the rate cave for these panamax ship  which are the largest bulk carrier  the daili rate has stiffen anoth          it is up to         from the         that i report at our last meet  even though this is usual the soft   e of the year   just for a refer point  last year at this  e it was one half that price   at home our banker report  in the word of the ceo of the largest bank in texa     more talk about price increas and pass through      we are see the return in our district of the term    air ball financ     which is financ base on prospect not on hard realiti   one exampl that caught my interest  which is yet unreport in the public press  is that  accord to the ceo of a larg corpor with a     billion market capit  they have been  approach by a singl buyout group to take them privat   so there is a lot of liquid left in the system   the ceo of wal mart usa report that they are build in a price increas of   percent this year   it is the first increas in a long  long  e   typic they built in minus   percent to     minus   percent   the increas was confirm by the ceo of one of wal mart   s largest supplier of nongroceri good  who quot lee scott as tell him last week     we are reach the limit of product enhanc and may have to take it out in price increas      kimber clark   s ceo report that he start the year plan for an inflat factor in their cost of good sold of      million   it has been ratchet up in two interv and is now at      million   he report that they are cover increas in the cost of good sold through price increas   this is in sharp contrast to what he has been tell me befor everi previous meet   food processor report the same   it might be noteworthi that corn price   even though we don   t includ them in the core pce   are  becaus of ethanol product  up signific  that   s veri unusu at this  e of the year   frito lay   s ceo report an overal inflat shift    in his own word     the abil to pass through price increas and make them stick      final  mr  chairman  at a recent meet you ask about my report from hewitt  the consult compani  regard the prospect for health care cost   accord to one of my sourc  sever of the largest insur are focus on a settlement rang of rough   percent to     percent growth for next year   it is a littl more than they had expect  it is rough what it was last year   i might point out that those compani cover a larg number of peopl   to supplement this input  i touch base with three peopl i consid to be the best long term practition in the fund manag busi   each one has been in the busi for more than thirti year   besid report continu high appetit for risk and continu  elev liquid in the marketplac  these gnar old  er report a shift in the attitud of busi that they cover in invest   to quot one     befor  the oper we deal with were worri about get their head hand to them if they tri to pass through price increas  now they   re tri to see what they can get away with      in summari  the ceo of cadburi     schwepp   to kill the serpentin analog   say that    we   re just not through the snake yet on inflat      mr  chairman  this is a long and faith report   for all the inher risk  i pay close attent to what i hear from my ceo contact   accord to them  in addit to the data that we are see  the economi is slow from it torrid pace of growth and downshift to a more normal rang   global capac and util are not slow apac from what we can see  or if they are slow  overal global capac util is stay at an even level   it is also clear that the busi communiti has it finger pois on the trigger of price increas   it may well be that the lag effect of our de accommod has yet to temper the price equat   it may be that energi price and other cost push factor are at a point of taper off   it may be that moder in the domest economi   s growth rate will remov demand pull potenti  and it may be that tighten measur of our counterpart abroad will tamp down input price for our produc here  although it could have a counter effect in term of the exchang rate effect on the cost of import   but i do want to ask us to rememb that inflat is   as state in a paper that  was circul previous   an inerti process    the paper may have been from you  bill    we must be veri care in word and in deed that we do not encourag impuls that will spur that inertia and that will prove harder and more cost to rein in further down the road   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   incom data on the nation economi have been slight lower on the growth side and slight higher on the side of continu price escal than at least we expect  and we have seen reflect of both these trend in the new england economi   overal  howev  my sens is that growth for the region  and the nation remain relat solid but that price pressur are a concern       the region   s economi appear to continu to grow at a pace that will be suffici to keep local unemploy level in the four   the region has a slower pace of job growth than the nation  but total person incom is grow at about the same pace   this suggest that per capita incom growth is relat solid  which is reflect in rise retail sale and state incom tax collect   inde  local busi continu comment on their inabl to find skill labor so that at least some of the region   s slow job growth may be attribut to suppli rather than demand condit   new england   s residenti hous correct is becom more evid and  by some measur  may be more signific than that for the nation as a whole   home sale were   percent to   percent off their      high in the first quarter   that is similar to the nation  but the case shiller weiss repeat sale index see  at least for q   the nation   s home price escal at about    percent year over year but boston area price up much less than that   more recent data from other survey suggest that region price may be fall   inventori of home for sale continu to grow  and the valu of region residenti construct contract fell more than    percent  compar with about     percent for the nation   this number like reflect the relat small amount of residenti construct in the region  but the downturn is eye catch anyway   despit this  consum confid rebound a bit from earlier this summer  and busi contact report relat good perform   now  one thread in my recent convers with busi is not dissimilar to what presid   just talk about   i found it a bit troubl that manufactur and relat busi servic appear to believ that they have greater price power than befor   they are talk less about increas competit and less about effort to increas product   they seem to be less worri about margin squeez and more confid that rise input cost      particular those relat to energi  can be pass on   some even report that strong demand has enabl them to rais price or to avoid discount even without major new input cost pressur  in general  there was a disquiet tone of greater toler for inflat   on the nation scene  recent data on second quarter growth  employ  and hous market trend seem to indic a general soften of the economi   this is not unexpect   all of us have been forecast a gradual slowdown to potenti or slight below over       and       as the economi make a transit from consum led to busi led growth and the save rate  climb to a posit number   but has the evolv slowdown turn out to be a bigger soft patch than expect  or are we simpli suffer through the up and down of the transit process   i am not sure of the answer to that question   i found the relat low gdp and consumpt figur for late       and       in the  book forecast a bit disquiet  even after recogn the effect of the benchmark revis on potenti gdp   our forecast in boston had been in sync with the  book   s and on the low side of the rang of forecast around this tabl  but now we see growth of     to     percentag point abov the  book in         we   re not project as larg a hit to residenti invest over the  period  and we see solid dispos incom offset high energi cost and lower hous wealth to a greater degre than   the  book   moreov  although slow job growth is a concern  at full employ or beyond how much of this is a suppli rather than a demand phenomenon  particular when you take into account lower labor forc particip   are firm hesit to hire becaus they are fear of the futur or becaus they can   t find  the skill they need   they certain are not constrain by a lack of resourc   thus  i am inclin to the view that  although thing seem slower than we expect and the  book forecast seem softer  not much has realli chang sinc our last meet   consum spend     has been relat well maintain despit a weak in q    spend for equip and softwar appear to be in good shape   and net export  given growth abroad  will be posit at least for a  e   residenti invest is wane  but how fast is hard to say  and there well could be an offset to that from nonresidenti invest   financi market remain accommod  and given the rise in inflat  real rate are down   what is a bit differ is the fact that inflat is grow at a fa  pace in the short run and is grow across most aspect of the core measur   certain it is fa  and broader base than i would like  and we continu to see level off or fall price number onli in the  forecast   i recogn that will continu to be the case for some  e even in the best of circumst  but i am concern that we may not face the best of circumst   geopolit event of all sort and global demand continu to put pressur on input price   product growth is like slower  and econom activ may not wane enough to reduc resourc pressur   as  e goe by and outsiz inflat growth continu  one can imagin a sens of inflat complac grow   in that regard  as i note earlier  i found the region anecdot about make price increas stick of some concern   i should note here that my own board of director in a telephon meet just ye day indic concern about the ongo strength of the economi and vote to maintain the current primari credit rate   i myself worri about overdo the tighten process  but as i told them  i don   t think we   re at risk of that at present   given the pace of inflat and given financi market activ  real rate have  in fact  gone down not up  leav polici and overal financi condit more accommod than befor our last increas   in sum  i continu to be a bit less worri about variat in the cycl and more worri about the medium term prospect for  inflat
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   in our last meet i report that  while our southeast economi still seem reason solid  we were begin to pick up anecdot sign  that activ might be slow   well  that sluggish is now gradual show up in the data as well   the slow is perhap most notic in our labor market   although we are still hear that busi in some sector are have problem find worker  especi in area such as construct  account  and housekeep  payrol employ figur for june in our state were disappoint   they show season adjust contract with absolut declin report in georgia  tennesse  and mississippi and less than expect job growth in florida  employ seem to be tri their best to hold the line on staf  given the sens that they have of a slow in the pace of growth and an uncertain outlook   manufactur activ in our region is mix   consum spend remain softer than earlier in the year  and the tourism outlook is report to be guard op ist   the bright spot in some way is the gulf coast outsid new orlean  where the demand for most construct materi and labor and for replac household and person good is strong  but that pocket of elev spend is not enough to offset the sluggish elsewher   the big semiannu apparel and gift mart show in atlanta  where buyer just came to place their major order for expect year end holiday sale  was report to have been slow  the region banker are report slow in loan demand  particular in the consum hous sector   howev  the experi in c i lend is more mix   at the same  e  credit qualiti  in the word of two banker with whom we talk  was    unsustain    or    embarrass    good   bank are also pull back on their lend into the soften hous market   our data indic that singl famili construct remain relat strong in the     district   home sale have slow  and there now have been sharp correct in some market  especi coastal florida   perhap the most talk about new worri in our region  and someth i mention for the first  e at our last meet  is the grow problem of obtain afford wind  flood  and relat insur in our coastal area  result from the huge loss incur by insur compani from hurrican in recent year   some carrier have quit offer coverag at ani  price  and cost of polici that are avail have increas at extraordinari rate   that problem is affect residenti construct and sale and caus some busi to pull up stake and move elsewher   togeth  the various develop that i have just tick off have taken consider momentum out of the strong econom growth and outlook we were see in our region earlier in the year   our sens of what   s happen at the nation level is much the same   it now seem  reason clear that we have settl into a pattern of slower and probabl subpar growth   we saw evid of that in the second quarter gdp data and in the mark slower employ gain in recent month   the sever model that our atlanta staff now employ to forecast real growth are suggest somewhat slower growth in the     percent to   percent rang as be most like over the second half of this year and through        get a good handl on the inflat outlook is a bit harder   our most recent atlanta model work produc a somewhat encourag inflat path over the next    month  which suggest that core inflat should stop it upward drift and gradual begin to move back toward   percent   that op ist outlook is consist with the most like path laid out in the  book and with the central tendenc of the forecast we all submit for the recent congression tes oni   at the same  e  even those op ist forecast do not seem to     indic that core inflat is like to move comfort to within the rang mani of us have  indic we would like eventu to see   of cours  these encourag longer term or medium term  as some have been call it  outlook are veri much at odd with the discourag headlin number and the increas higher core inflat read in recent month   there seem to be good reason to expect that some of the come near term inflat data could well be disappoint befor we begin to see the expect improv  and these current data help to shape inflat expect   in one of our recent brief  an economist humbl observ that  despit all the work that has been done and continu to be done in the profess  our model for forecast inflat are still less than stellar as judg by past experi   so we go into the polici discuss with some encourag inflat forecast but have to acknowledg wide error band and consider uncertainti around those forecast   i look forward  i think  to an interest but probabl difficult polici discuss    laughter   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   my outlook hasn   t chang veri much  sinc last spring  when i was contempl the not so welcom cycl of slowdown in econom activ and some persist in both headlin and core inflat due to the linger effect of larg energi price increas   in fact  the  book project for real gdp now reflect someth close to the pessimist end of where i thought thing could be head   the differ is that i have been think more of a cyclic slowdown and not so much of a slowdown in demand and suppli  as reflect in the  book baselin   the possibl that slack might not be widen as econom growth move down put the recent inflat number in a particular bad light       i have been especi concern about how broad base the inflationari pressur appear to be   when you take energi compon out of the cpi and you look at the median that   was refer to earlier  about    percent of the expenditur weight item in the cpi increas at an annual rate of   percent or more in june  which is about the same share that we have seen sinc march   as   mention  the pce statist yield basic the same  result   in procter   gambl   s most recent earn report  the compani attribut it good earn perform part to the abil to pass on higher cost through to product price  and i am hear similar remark about price power from our director and district busi  contact   although my busi contact have been report some abil to pass on price increas now at the retail level  where in the past they were say that it was veri difficult to go beyond intermedi good  they   re not so sure that they will get more than one  e catch up adjust   most of my busi contact have not express concern about an elev in the long term inflat trend   nevertheless  i think there are clear reason to be worri about the risk of inflationari pressur intensifi over the balanc of the project period   i also think that there is a risk that we   re not go to see as much slack as is embed in the  book baselin   as in mani other part of the countri  activ in the hous sector is slow in the midwest  particular in the fourth district  and the hous situat in the fourth district could never be character as bubbl or frothi   some of the veteran realtor in my district with whom i have been talk are say that this hous market is the worst that they can recal   comment like these   although they are select  do suggest some more uncertain prospect for the hous sector   my director and busi contact have also been sound a bit more cautious about the outlook for     their sale  but at the same  e their capit spend plan appear to be intact   they remain vocal about the abil to get product gain  and they remain disciplin about their hire plan   so as i contempl the weaker spend track that   s forecast in the  book  i   m  inclin to attribut more of it to the demand side of the economi than to the suppli side   that is  i am expect the  book   s call for moder in econom growth to result in a littl more slack than appear in the  book   s baselin   in a qualit sens  my outlook carri lower inflationari pressur than the  book baselin and thus is similar in spirit to the    lower nairu    altern scenario   separ the cyclic and structur perform of the economi  of cours  is a real challeng  and it is natur  i think  to feel unsur about the real  e es  and project of slack   if the slower growth of potenti output in the  book baselin is accur  it rais the possibl that the equilibrium real interest rate may be lower than it was in the last half of the     s   in summari  mr  chairman  i still think there are risk to both of our object   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the fifth district   s economi remain general strong  though overal growth appear to have moder in recent week   retail sale have been lacklust  especi for big ticket item   manufactur shipment and new order pick up in juli  howev  and our earli read for august are even stronger in suggest addit momentum go forward   district labor market remain tight  with worker in some skill categori hard to find in urban area and temporari worker in demand   the hous market continu to slow general  although market differ signific across our district  current and expect price trend measur remain veri elev  accord to our survey  as they have been for most of the year       turn to the nation economi  i focus at our last two meet on my concern about the deterior outlook for inflat  and the news over the intermeet period has heighten those concern   but today i think it is import that we also assess care the outlook for output and employ   i   m pretti sure that i can safe do so without danger of be view as an output nutter    laughter   gdp growth has been choppi in recent quarter  but over the past year and a half  output has been grow at about     percent   you get the same     percent growth rate if you averag over the past three and a half year   we have substanti reduc the overhang of underutil resourc over that period   employ has grown about     percent a year  and the labor forc has grown at just a littl over   percent   i think the evid is now fair persuas that resourc are approxim fulli util in the sens that signific amount of idl labor or capit do not seem to be await the return of better  e   what sort of growth rate for output or employ are sustain over the next two year   the labor forc appear like to grow at about   percent   that is  about         job per month   labor product has been trend around     percent over the past coupl of year  but i would be a bit more conserv go forward and expect about    percent per year  closer to the long run averag   as a result  it seem reason to put the center point of an es  of a sustain real growth rate at about    percent  with perhap some extra abov that if you   re more op ist about product growth   is this trend our best near term forecast   sever factor could contribut to weaker real growth   residenti invest will contract in the come quarter as the hous market cool  and lower averag hous price appreci will reduc household wealth gain and damp consumpt growth   the upward sweep in energi price has taken a bite out of real dispos     incom as well  but i would expect real household spend to track real household incom  go forward becaus both the hous price adjust and the energi price run up  so far at least  look more like one  e reduct in household wealth and incom and not like sourc of ongo eros extend out more than a year   so i think it is reason to expect consumpt to grow at close to   percent  down a bit from the averag of     percent over the past sever year   other factor seem like to bol  growth   busi fix invest spend has been expand quit strong in this recoveri   it is up at an annual rate of close to   percent sinc the begin of       despit the sluggish of structur until this year   in the second quarter  bfi was up     percent year over year  and the most recent high frequenc indic remain on track   bfi spend as a share of gdp is still quit low by histor standard  and as the  book point out  the fundament   busi balanc sheet and output growth   look quit solid   so it seem reason to expect busi invest to continu to expand at a rate close to   percent   put everyth togeth  i expect growth over the next year and a half to be just under   percent  or just more than   percentag point below potenti   the  book forecast is weaker   gdp growth at about    percent for the next six quarter   main becaus the board staff see lower busi invest spend and a pronounc revers in the household save  rate   i think that a healthi respect for the uncertainti involv suggest that reason confid interv around each of these forecast   the  book   s and my own and the other i   ve heard today  for that matter   would includ all the other point es  and  more import  would includ the possibl that growth proceed at potenti over the forecast     period and beyond   so though it is reason to expect growth at or less than potenti in the near term  my sens is that it   s hard to be too certain that it will be much below for long   as i said at the outset  the inflat pictur has onli worsen   the surg in core inflat that began in march has continu into june   the month pattern       percent in march at an annual rate      in april      in may  and     in june   make this episod look less and less like a temporari bulg and more and more like a sustain increas   it is worth note that the current acceler in core inflat is broad base  as the  book emphas and presid pool abli articul  and not attribut to ani narrow set of special factor   the annual revis to the nation incom and product account onc again rais inflat for past year  although not that much this  e  as presid   note   it now appear that year over year core pce inflat has exceed   percent everi month sinc april        perhap the most strike chang in the annual revis  howev  was in wage and salari   the puzzl of compens growth bulg in      and slow in      is now gone  and it is now clear that compens is on a broad upsw   the board staff es  that nonfarm busi compens per hour acceler from a trend around   percent to someth over     percent   in fact      percent was today   s releas   unit labor cost have deterior accord and now show an annual rate of increas of     percent in the second quarter  accord to today   s releas  and they are up     percent year over year   befor the nipa revis  the behavior of unit labor cost suggest that the current increas in inflat was not be incorpor into nomin wage compens  but the labor cost data now show exact the opposit   that the acceler of inflat in recent month has induc a broad acceler in nomin wage       i find it hard to be confid that a surg in unit labor cost is like to be absorb by fall markup   measur markup have been trend up for some  e  and i think they still do after the revis   our econom understand of the determin of markup  especi at the macroeconom level  is still quit limit   in mani model  the markup is entir a real phenomenon and thus would be invari with respect to pure nomin acceler in cost  the main except are the sticki price model  but these don   t provid much comfort becaus in them a high markup is a forecast of acceler nomin margin cost   that is to say  an upsw in inflat   so i don   t take much comfort from the high level of markup   combin the growth and inflat outlook  it is worth think care about the extent to which we can expect slow growth to bring inflat down   there have been a number of skeptic comment about that hypothesi around the tabl today   the relationship between output gap and inflat is quit tenuous  as the staff right emphas whenev the subject come up   empir  the abil to discov this relationship reli heavili on recess and  thus  is much less reliabl as an indic of the effect on inflat of a small widen of the gap   inde  at our last meet and again today      character the effect of the expect path of the output gap on inflat over the forecast period as tini  the combin of uncertainti about the relationship between output gap and inflat and the uncertainti about the degre to which growth is like to fall short of potenti should  i think  leav us deepli skeptic about whether we can reli on expect moder in growth to bring inflat down   it is unfortun that so mani comment place so much weight on that in respons to our last statement   let me add a comment or two about presid     s most excel statement   i think the insight she articul about backward look inflat model break down and the     differ inflat dynam in forward look model is veri import for our polici deliber   her staff appar has document that inflat now look more as though it   s fluctuat around a sampl averag   i   ll say  a trend   and less as though it   s driven by output gap measur   she conclud that we may see inflat fall fa  than the  book forecast do   i want to regist a coupl of observ   the first is that  with forward look expect  inflat behavior is far more sensit to chang in the public   s belief about our behavior than in model in which inflat expect format is backward look   i   d regist just the possibl that the long run expect inflat that the public believ appli has been drift around and may  in fact  account for some of the swing of measur inflat around sampl averag   final  certain take the point of view that inflat expect are form in a forward look manner make more like the possibl that inflat will come down fa  than the  book state   but with inflat look forward  it becom our respons to bring that about   so that happi outcom could requir our action and our strong communic  but i would welcom inspect  if i could  the work of presid     s staff  and i welcom her contribut
thank you   presid
good morn   thank you  mr  chairman   it   s a pleasur to be here today at my first meet   mani peopl around the tabl i   ve known for mani  mani year  other i don   t know so well  but i   m look forward to get to know you better   i realiz that as the new kid on the block  so to speak  i have a lot to learn   i   ve been on the job one week today  and that realiz has been driven home to me in the past week quit ampli by the fact that i   ve struggl to prepar for this meet   i have to confess that it did occur to me at a     coupl of point that mayb my start date should have been move to august       laughter  mayb that was a failur of ration expect or mayb just a simpl forecast error   i   m not  sure yet   nonetheless  i realli am honor to be here and to be a part of this group  and i   m look forward to work with all of you   econom activ in the third district continu to expand at a moder pace  albeit somewhat more slowli than earlier in the year   of cours  this was in line with expect in previous report by bill stone to you   region manufactur activ expand in juli   our busi outlook survey   s index of general activ fell to   in juli  down from    in june  and the index of new order and shipment also soften   but the level of these indic continu to point to expans in term of manufactur in the region and manufactur     expect of futur activ   condit in our construct sector are similar to what other peopl have been report   nonresidenti construct continu to strengthen in our district   banker are report increas strength in commerci real estat lend   offic vacanc rate have been edg down  and rent have been move up   our busi contact expect those trend to continu   in contrast  as in much of the nation  residenti construct and home sale are down  residenti mortgag lend has slow consider  although home equiti lend has been quit strong   realtor report that the inventori of home for sale is at the highest level they   ve seen in a number of year  they also report that price are higher than they were last year  but the rate of appreci tend to be soften   thus far the slow in the region   s residenti hous sector seem to have been an order one   retail report a firm of sale in general merchandis in june and juli  with sale at store special in high end merchandis be stronger than those at the lower end      manufactur    incent have help boost auto sale in juli in the region  but dealer tell us that inventori remain abov their desir level   payrol employ in our three state has been expand at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole  but that   s not atyp of the region   the unemploy rate has edg down   in june  it was     percent   in most of the district   s labor market  unemploy is lower now than it was a year ago   our busi contact continu to report difficulti in fill  posit   there has been some relief this summer with the influx of colleg student  but that cushion is about to end   it has been particular hard in the district for firm to fill profession and manageri posit   firm have receiv a good number of applic  but mani of the applic are unqualifi   consequ  salari for these posit have risen more than other   our manufactur report that recent wage increas in the region are higher than they were last year   this is consist with the employ cost index  which show stronger compens growth in the northeast than in other part of the nation   on balanc  the region condit and outlook continu to be posit   the rate of expans in the second half of the year is like to be somewhat slower than in the first half  but  again  that was expect   i   m more concern about sign of continu and grow price pressur in the district  consum price appear to be rise at a fa  pace in the philadelphia region than in the nation as a whole   one factor contribut to the fa  pace has been the increas in hous cost in metropolitan philadelphia  but that may prove to be temporari as hous price stabil  nonetheless  broad base cost pressur persist in most sector of the region   the index of both price paid and price receiv in our manufactur survey have increas in juli  and both are at veri high level   busi contact say that price pressur continu to be one of  their major concern       i would character the nation economi in a somewhat similar way   that is  right now i tend to be more concern about inflat than i am about growth   i don   t view the second quarter slowdown as necessarili a precursor to a signific weaken of the economi go forward   the below trend growth in the second quarter was wide anticip  and averag over the first two quarter  as sever peopl have done  output still grew at over   percent in the first two quarter   the slowdown in residenti invest was expect  and much of the slowdown in consum spend was due to auto sale  which are volatil and which had grown veri strong in the first quarter and consider less in the second   one surpris  howev  did occur in the second quarter number   we expect busi invest in equip and softwar to slow last quarter from it veri robust pace in the first quarter  but we didn   t expect an outright declin   about half that swing  it turn out  reflect the  e of busi purchas  particular of transport and auto  so the weak in invest may be more about  e than it is about trend   inde  as has been point out  corpor profit remain high  and capac util rate remain high  and these data continu to point to the under strength in busi invest   the juli employ number releas on friday did littl to chang my view of the economi   employ continu to grow at a reason pace  although somewhat slower than earlier in the year   in juli  employ in the privat sector expand at it fastest pace sinc march   although the number was not larg  the trend was at least mild encourag  employ base on the household survey fell   the unemploy rate increas     percent  but household employ has been volatil   the declin of        job in juli follow a gain of         job in the household survey in june   if we abstract from the month to month      volatil in these number  the unemploy rate remain low for the first half of the year at about     percent   at this point  i believ the econom indic are consist with sustain real growth near trend  as mani peopl have suggest   the benchmark gdp revis suggest that trend might be a tad lower than we thought  but nonetheless i think the risk to growth seem at least rough balanc   the inflat pictur  howev  has not improv   despit a slow economi  price increas have been acceler   the increas have been broad base  as has been point out by bill pool and other   they are no longer confin to energi and other commod  inde  in june the cpi rose less than did the cpi exclud energi   core inflat is abov the rang i consid to be consist with price stabil  and to my mind  inflat risk remain tilt to the upsid   the  book   s baselin forecast has core inflat deceler over the next year  but the staff has been mark up it forecast path of inflat over  e as the acceler in inflat has persist   even with the project deceler  the baselin forecast has core pce inflat remain abov   percent through        given this persist in inflat  unaccept high inflat seem like to be around for a while   a year ago i wouldn   t have said that   in fact  i was in the camp that thought it was most a relat price phenomenon  but that posit has becom less compel to me over the past year   the benchmark revis to the gdp report show that both compens per hour and unit labor cost have been trend up  not down as earlier data suggest   energi price increas have not abat  suggest that we are like to see continu pass through to core inflat  perhap for some  e   although the committe has brought the fed fund rate up appreci from histor low level  real interest rate to my mind are not high   i don   t view     monetari polici as particular restrict at this point   thus  i have to put some weight on the  book   s altern scenario of persist high inflat  and that lead to particular poor outcom   even if i accept the baselin forecast as my point forecast  the fact that inflat remain at a level abov the rang consist with price stabil for a consider period is troubl   i am comfort by the fact that medium  and longer term inflat expect have remain relat stabl despit the acceler in inflat   that   s a testament to the credibl of the fed in the marketplac   that it will keep inflat low   but how reason is it to think that inflat expect will remain unchang   by allow inflat to remain at a high level for a  e   we are  after all  as sever peopl have point out  in the third year of core inflat run abov   percent   do we risk send the messag that we are will to toler higher inflat   if so  will expect adjust accord   as the model simul of op  polici path and outcom in chart   of the bluebook indic  it   s veri cost to get inflat back down onc it has been abov our object  particular if expect are allow to increas   i believ that monetari polici has an import role to play in ensur that the recent high inflat read do not rais longer term inflat expect   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   as has been observ  growth moder in the second quarter larg as anticip   the economi is perhap return to a sustain pace of growth   one  i would add  that may be abov the  book forecast for next year   as i thought about the  book  much of it seem plausibl to me  but our var model provid somewhat more rapid growth next year   when i step back and think about various compon of aggreg demand  it seem to me that we might get a bit more out of busi invest in     equip and softwar and net export  and i think the suppli side of the economi is  suffici flexibl to accommod that   with regard to inflat and it prospect  littl has chang from the last meet in my opinion  and i doubt much will chang in the near term  or at least not much will chang for the better in the near term   this suggest to me that we should be prepar to see core inflat run on a year over year basi near or abov     percent for sever more month  perhap sever more quarter   i haven   t heard anyth from the busi peopl with whom i   ve been in contact that suggest that a moder of inflat is at hand or that aggreg demand  demand for good and servic  is slow in an unanticip way  except for what is turn out to be a pretti mediocr tourism season in our district  one distinct posit develop   and i think   just refer to this   has been the stabil of inflat expect in the face of incom inform on inflat that might have led to some upward revis in those expect   the fact that expect have remain well anchor so far is someth that look posit to me   overal  as i tri to assess the risk  it seem to me that the near term inflat risk are tilt to the upsid even though i continu to expect core inflat to eas back down in the longer term   as for the risk associ with growth  i think here uncertainti has increas  howev  against the background of the latest  book forecast  i think mayb the risk to growth are also tilt to the upsid   onli i wouldn   t use the term    risk      i would consid that to be a posit develop if in fact it occur
mr  chairman  thank you   obvious we are deal with a difficult set of circumst   we have inform that the growth of the economi is slow and inflat     is rise  not someth we particular like to see   we have seen slow consumpt nation  and certain our district has seen some of it   the one except is in some area where we have an energi boom go on  which is not necessarili advantag to other part of the countri   we also have slow residenti invest in our district   inventori are build up rapid  both in the ea n side of the district and in the denver we n side  and we have some pretti sharp increas in bankruptci level in the denver area   the shock of energi cost have affect consumpt  and i think that effect will carri through   we have been more op ist about manufactur   even though our survey have shown some slowdown  recent  the six month ahead forecast are still fair op ist  there is no deni that the inflat level is up  and i think that increas reflect past polici accommod that is still in play   i also think that some of the suppli shock are have their effect  and the shock themselv are continu forward   that situat is be aggrav a bit for our district  and perhap will be even more for the nation  by the drought that we are experienc  which is reduc some of the crop output in the area   the outlook  therefor  is not particular encourag   i think consumpt will show some further slow go forward  especi as we see further shock in the economi relat to energi   some of the wealth effect relat to the hous industri will also affect consumpt go forward  the outlook in term of busi fix invest is unclear   bfi has been pretti good   the outlook seem fair good right now  but it is slow to some degre   polici is moder  not signific  restrict  but it seem to be work it way through fair slowli  while these factor are in place  we worri about whether the real rate will declin  which i think     mention   i also worri that the declin will affect inflat expect and caus them to shift   that is an upsid risk to the economi in term of the inflat that i do     worri about   still  i suggest that we are move as expect   we have some short term  inflationari pressur that are go to continu  that are    bake in the cake     as they say   and i do worri that   as we move forward and if the economi slow  as i suspect it will   our big challeng will be not to eas too soon   thank you
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to offer just a few anecdot  start with wal mart   at the begin of the year  wal mart   s plan for same store sale was for growth of   percent to   percent  but growth has run persist below that sinc ea    juli came in at     percent   they had expect a rang of   to   percent   howev  i think we have to be a littl care in interpret juli data in general becaus it was unusu hot over much of the countri  and wal mart say that they particular sold a lot of what they call    hot weather good     like air condition and fan   my contact say that higher price item with higher margin are general do better than the lower price good   he is still see pressur on the lower incom shopper at wal mart   food inflat is actual come down a bit   it is now below   percent   my contact observ that supplier seem to have paus in take price increas  but he   s not sure whether that   s just part of a cycl dure the year   he also note that the rate of price deflat is also less than it was for a number of item   particular apparel and standard electron item   that have been deflat for quit a number of year   those price are still declin but not as rapid as befor  i had two read from the transport industri suggest that juli was surpris weak   up express volum in juli came in   percent to   percent below plan  and a larg truck compani said that the juli truck volum was flat year over year and the weak was pretti much spread over all part of the countri  although more pronounc in the upper     midwest   it seem to be broad base in term of product categori   he said that in the truck industri  or at least in his firm  they are increas nervous about recess  up note that there is potenti for disrupt   their pilot    union is current in a ratif vote  which is suppos to be complet by septemb     there   s a great deal of opposit within the union and some genuin possibl that the contract will be vote down  with associ job action and disrupt of various sort    my fedex contact said he realli had  noth new  and he didn   t even want to talk about that    laughter  let me make a comment about the nation economi   i want to talk about it in term of the risk we face and to use a phillip curv diagram as a devic   we   ll center the axe on the  book forecast   one of the quadrant here has higher growth and lower inflat than forecast   i think we   re not veri like to be in that quadrant   it   s not imposs  but i don   t think it   s probabl   so let   s talk about the other three quadrant   one of them has good growth and higher inflat   we could end up in that quadrant  and that would just mean that we   re go to have the problem of deal with the inflat over the longer haul even though our immedi futur might not have a growth complic   quit frank  i think we   re most like go to be deal with one of the other two quadrant   one of them has lower growth with declin inflat   i think the inflat pressur are pretti persist and sustain  so i think we   re actual most like go to end up in the veri unfortun quadrant where we have sustain inflat pressur run at the  book forecast rate or abov and growth run at that rate or lower   that situat is go to be veri uncomfort for us  but we   re go to have to be readi to deal with it   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   growth has moder  but the economi still seem  to us at least  like to grow at a reason good pace over the forecast period  somewher in the vicin of   percent   we expect core inflat to moder gradual from current level  declin to around   percent in         this forecast assum that monetari polici follow a path fair close to what   s in the market and in the  book  the key differ between our view of the outlook and that of the  book forecast is in the strength of demand growth relat to potenti next year   we have reduc a bit our es  of potenti and also of actual growth  but we still expect the economi to expand at a rate close to potenti   this is a veri favor forecast  and we have to recogn  of cours  that the economi is go through a set of extrem complic transit  includ a larg  advers  sustain relat price shock of uncertain durat and a substanti adjust in asset price that is now concentr in hous   our capac to anticip the evolut of these forc and to assess their effect on growth and inflat is  of cours  veri limit   the forc that now appear to be work on the economi still present the unpleas combin of upsid risk to inflat and downsid risk to growth  but for the moment we believ that the former  the possibl that our forecast is too op ist on inflat  remain the predomin risk  i have a few point on the growth outlook   the economi has clear slow  and the composit of growth within the unit state and here relat to the rest of the world has  chang   these chang were inevit  and if they continu to occur smooth  they seem desir and necessari   as a share of aggreg demand within the unit state  residenti invest had to contract and consumpt had to slow   and u s  domest demand had to slow relat to domest demand growth in the rest of the world   the key issu we face is     judg whether we have signific more weak ahead of us than we are now expect  in our view  most sign at present point to fundament healthi econom condit   the survey base measur of confid are hold up okay   real household incom growth seem like to be good go forward   busi have the resourc and the motiv to sustain fair strong rate of invest growth   structur product growth  even post revis  still seem strong   inventori level remain relat thin  and the tentat that character much of the expans in term of invest and hire should be a sourc of some comfort   global demand is still quit strong  of cours  and togeth these forc will offset part  but not all  of the weak come from the adjust in hous and consumpt growth   the princip risk to this outlook for growth lie in the possibl that household will slow consumpt more sharpli becaus of rise energi cost  higher interest rate  greater pessim about futur incom gain  or the effect of the hous adjust on perceiv  wealth  financi market are show a littl more concern about futur growth  but not a lot  this concern is most evid in the greater invers in the yield curv that has emerg at the one year to two year horizon   i think you can see in the market some moder of exuber in credit market  but just a littl   overal  the market seem to reflect a reason favor view of futur growth prospect  on the inflat side  as i said  we expect core inflat to moder  not quick and not dramat but by enough and soon enough to bring core pce inflat down to just below   percent over the next    month   the issu we face is not so much about the acceler in  core inflat that occur in late      and        after that acceler  core inflat was sort of trendless  in the vicin of   percent for much of the two year period  until the past six     month  when we saw this uptick   the real problem we face is assess the extent to which the veri recent acceler in core inflat reflect transitori factor  such as the indirect effect of energi price  and the extent to which it may reflect pressur from higher resourc util and other thing less benign and less transitori   energi pass through  of cours  seem part of it  but probabl not all of it   shelter  sn   t account for all of it either   this judgment is critic for us  and we need to be care that we   re not assum away the more uncomfort explan  such as a broader inflationari impuls or a rise in price power that could reflect increas  accept of higher inflat  how confid can we be that the pressur that have induc this rise in core inflat  will moder suffici to bring down the rate of increas in core pce price to the vicin of   percent or below   reason confid  i think   with the economi grow at or slight below trend  with growth of unit labor cost peak and deceler a bit as the  book forecast anticip  with inflat expect moder at short horizon and pretti stabl at longer run horizon  with energi price flatten out  and with the dollar fall onli a littl  this forecast seem reason   but note the number of assumpt and condit this forecast depend on   also  the expect path for inflat impli onli a veri gradual moder and a period of sustain inflat abov what is presum to be consist with this central bank   s long term prefer   the risk of this forecast  as i said  still seem to lie on the upsid   it may be some  e befor we can be confid that the forc are in place to produc the necessari moder  more general  howev  we face the veri difficult consequenti challeng of tri to figur out the longer term consequ of have been in an except long period of except low real interest rate   both real short rate and forward rate   that were induc     by monetari author here and around the world    real short rate now look as though they were perhap lower relat to the es  of equilibrium even than we thought   perhap more remark was the low level of forward real rate dure much of our tighten phase   these financi condit may have produc more inflat momentum than we thought  and this may be the case even though there is some reassur in the stabil of long term expect  those expect are substanti below the peak in       at the long horizon  howev  the rise in asset price and residenti invest and the leverag caus by this long period of veri expansionari monetari polici may lead to a process of adjust in asset price that could be more sustain and more damag in term of confid and of demand than we expect   this risk is greater if we end up allow more inflat than our forecast anticip  for the requir monetari polici respons could induc an even sharper adjust in risk premium and asset price   this possibl argu for a lot of humil in judg the appropri of the present stanc of monetari polici and what will be appropri over  e  and it argu most for have as much flexibl as we can go forward  emphas that the inflat risk remain the predomin concern of the committe  thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you have remark  the inflat news over the intermeet period was not favor   core consum price continu to run at an elev level  and the cpi actual came in on the high side of expect   the shortfal in the pce that presid   referenc was  i think  more of those my i nonmarket compon   petroleum price rose further  impli addit feed through go forward  price of other commod  as   remark  were on averag unchang to somewhat     higher  suggest not onli continu cost pressur on produc but sustain strength in global demand   earli es  of unit labor cost for the second half of last year and the first half of this year show a fa  increas than had been es  and anticip   the compens data for the earli part of this year  in particular  are subject to veri larg revis  even the now fa  growth  sn   t necessarili indic that the economi has been oper beyond it sustain potenti  given the likelihood of some catch up with past product gain  the still quit elev profit margin  and the moder increas in the eci   but at the veri least  the unit labor cost stori  sn   t provid as much comfort about futur inflat as it did previous   larg as a consequ  the staff revis up it inflat forecast for      and       and that respons seem reason to me  at the same  e  some develop over the intermeet period help me feel a touch more comfort  or perhap a touch less uncomfort  with the downward trajectori for inflat after the bulg   one of them that a number of you have mention from survey is that the long term inflat expect in the market remain stabl or even edg down a littl despit higher energi price and  import  despit downward revis to the expect path of monetari polici   if i were forecast today  i would forecast a slight higher inflat rate  but i would also forecast a slight higher unemploy rate than i did befor   to be sure  output gap  as you   ve mention  don   t play a larg role in determin inflat  but certain the growth of demand relat to potenti has some effect on the competit condit that busi are face and on their abil to pass through cost  from the inform that we receiv over the intermeet period  growth slight below the growth rate of the economi   s potenti seem more like than it seem a month or so ago  and this would inhibit the pass through of higher energi and labor cost   weak in the     hous sector has deepen  and we have not yet seen the full implic of the rise in long term and short term interest rate over the first half of the year   this weak seem to be have an effect on hous price as well as on activ   the effect of a lower expect trajectori for hous wealth and the increas in interest rate this year haven   t begun to show through to consumpt  judg from the minus     percent save rate   the energi price increas of recent week will take someth more out of consumpt  recent data are consist with a below trend track for the growth of econom activ  privat domest final purchas increas at a rate of onli   percent in the second quarter   the consumpt and invest data for late month in the quarter don   t suggest an acceler go into the third quarter   the growth of employ has been run slight below what would be a steadi state pace if particip were to remain stabl  and particip has edg higher   the greater increas than had been anticip in inventori in the second quarter suggest littl impetus or even a small drag from inventori accumul in the third and fourth quarter   the growth of feder govern spend seem to be drop back a bit as katrina relat expenditur top out   moreov  the recent higher rate of core inflat  though they are puzzl to a consider extent  must reflect some influenc that are unlik to be repeat indefinit into the futur   one of those is the rise in oil and energi price   the recent rise clear has been associ with escal tension in the mideast and other produc area  as well as the recent cutback in suppli from alaska   at some point  the risk of suppli disrupt  while remain veri high  should level out   as a consequ  so  too  should energi price  which will reduc core inflat as the feed through fade  anoth factor boost inflat in recent month was relat to rise rent and  in particular  to an even greater increas in owner    equival rent   the staff has assum that     owner    equival rent will rise in line with other rent and that both will continu to increas fair rapid but less rapid than they did   that seem reason to me  given the increas avail of hous and apart on the market that would  at some point  seem to limit the rise in rent as well as hous price   so my conclus is that the staff forecast of a gradual moder of core inflat after the second quarter is a reason expect  although i am veri worri about upsid risk to inflat   the inflat rate look as though it will end up a tad higher than either the staff or i thought like at the  e of our june meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i think our decis today is go to be a close call becaus of the recent inform we   ve gotten both on inflat and on the growth of the economi   we know that  as presid pool and other have mention  wage and price inflat has been acceler and is fair broad base   the recent nipa revis also concern me becaus of the fa  growth in core pce price that those data show   the busi survey  in fact  show that compani feel they have more price power than they have had in the past   we know that we are go to have some continu feed through of the higher price of oil   after talk to some folk in the oil industri  i am concern about the recent alaska situat   it clear show that mainten of equip and the effici of the oper of some of these compani may be under stress with the high volum of capac at which they have been run   we pray that it  sn   t extend much further in addit surpris  what also concern me about the nipa revis are the chang in the product number   the fact that with the nipa revis we are see lower product and fa  rise labor cost has implic for our forward expect on inflat   we also see that     busi invest in equip and softwar was much lower   that downward revis worri me becaus it impli that less capit deepen has occur  and that would have been a strong base to support product go forward   now we appar cannot reli on it as a base as much as we could befor the revis  in term of the hous market  the rapid escal of home sale cancel clear has been veri surpris   again  the gross sale figur don   t show this  but the inform we   ve got on the cancel indic a much more pronounc slowdown than we might have expect   in look through other hous cycl and in talk to banker and lender  one of the good thing i find is that the industri learn in the     s   becaus those in the industri are more sophist in the way they manag their land cost and their inventori  i think the length of the cycl is unlik to be as long   in the     s  banker made plenti of fund avail for compani to continu to develop land and to put in infrastructur   when the hous bubbl burst  all of a sudden we had unsold hous unit   they had to be sold befor builder could start build on the develop that had alreadi been laid out  and it took us sever year to work through that   this  e we don   t have the unfinish inventori of develop that we had in the      s   so i think that the cycl is like to be much shorter than it was then and that it will put some firm in that market   at the same  e  this is the sector  asid from energi and commod  that had a veri rapid rise in price  and it   s good that we   re see some correct in those price right now   the other good trend that i take comfort in is the one that dino mention earlier   that we   re see central bank around the world rais rate   when we start rais our rate a coupl of year ago  there weren   t too mani move at the same  e we did   we know that today monetari polici has global effect   excess accommod in some countri clear     can affect invest in other countri   so i think we now have support in what we   re do to remov accommod   we   re see that support more broad across the world  and in the aggreg  then  it will help to moder inflat in the period go forward   final  i   m  remind that we do have long lag in monetari polici  and we still have to see the full impact of what we have alreadi put in train   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   i see it   s        and i   m told that coffe is readi outsid   whi don   t we take a fifteen minut break   thank you   coffe break
has a coupl of comment on the product data from this morn
thank you  mr  chairman   just veri briefli  these data came in  in most respect  pretti close to our expect   i would note that the product figur for the second  quarter are built on the output data that were incorpor in last week   s advanc gdp number   we expect nonfarm busi product in the second quarter to be revis up   base on inform avail today  it would be revis up     percentag point  to     percent   probabl becaus of  some fluctuat in hour  the product number in q  is     percentag point stronger than we had expect   in q   it   s     percentag point weaker   on balanc  the profil there look much as we had expect   compens per hour is     percentag point stronger in q  than we had project and right on our  book project in q
thank you   let   s turn now to governor
thank you  mr  chairman   the treasuri market have convinc themselv in recent day and week of the prospect of lower growth  lower rate  and some degre   of comfort with inflat  and they seem to have lurch to that on a somewhat acceler basi in     the past sever week   but with some degre of humil  i   ll say i   m not quit as convinc as they are   i suspect that they may lose some of their convict if some of the data that we   ve all   talk about this morn around this tabl come to pass   so we need to be keen in look at inflat expect  at the shape of the curv  and at the price of some of these treasuri secur to evalu the market reaction to what we do  i have just a coupl of other general comment   we   ll have read on inflat soon  but i   m not persuad that we will have a good view of how persist inflat will like be   i suspect it will continu to trend to the upsid and will beg those market for a further review of the state of inflat expect   similar  i am not sure we   re go to have definit view on growth   i had a lot of discuss with a whole host of folk in the consum and busi sector   they are hear  much as we are  top down es  for lower growth in the second half  but their own bottom up analysi  sn   t seem to be bear that out even here in the second quarter   the onli thing i   d note at the outset from the bea revis is that  though growth has come down somewhat over the histor period  quarter over quarter varianc seem to be at least as pronounc as it was in the origin dataset  so the data are like to be rather volatil  i would suspect  as we look through the forecast period     with that in mind  i thought i   d take a coupl of minut look at growth in the consum and busi sector and then spend a few moment on inflat   with respect to the consum   sector  i am probabl more convinc at this meet than even befor that great tumult is go on  below the surfac   in discuss with some of the big credit card processor  i ask them to tell  me what they   re see   they   re see huge chang in categori of purchas and even in the  type of purchas if we exclud energi and gas product   in sum  howev  consum spend look quit strong to most of them through june and  import  through the first month of the     third quarter   although they had talk to their board about lower volum in the second half  they have yet to see it in much of their data across a rang of lower incom american as well as american with higher net worth   they   re not see much soft at all   the other piec come  out of those discuss is that they had expect to see a ramp up in delinqu   again  with much vaunt news of a slow hous sector  higher energi price  and a slower second half    and they have not   the news about delinqu continu to be veri encourag go into the   third quarter   it also rais the question of whether or not we   re go to see an inflect point  with all the discuss about the slower second half  we would have expect that person consumpt would have shown some more meaning effect than the data suggest   so i   m not persuad that sever meet from now we   re go to have this    aha    moment and that we   re go to see this inflect point   on the growth front  i still have the view that growth continu to be abov the  book project   but i am more concern  of cours  about inflat   i have just a coupl of other point of interest on the consum front   the juli index of consum sen ent   not suggest much of a slowdown in consum confid  and when i look at the survey sinc our last meet  i came to a coupl of conclus   when the survey ask question such as    how are you do     and    what is your person financi condit     the number tend to go in a rather posit direct      i   m do pretti well  not great    is the answer  if   you cut through the data   when the survey ask other question such as    how is your neighbor do  or    what is the state of the economi or the state of busi condit     the answer we   re get is     well  my neighbor is have all sort of troubl      if we   re tri to judg the economi by what folk know best of all  i guess i don   t see much of a reason to expect that some of the worst case scenario will come to pass        feder tax receipt  which i mention at most of our meet  for juli show year over  year growth of about    percent   the gain in wage and salari impli by these increas tax collect final make some more sens in light of the recast of the offici data from last  week   s revis  with real wage and salari have risen     percent over the past year  which is about a six year high   turn now to the busi sector  i put myself as probabl as confid as most around the tabl on the state of this sector  though i have heard some talk of a diminut in    anim spirit      but if you look at the data  you see that  as discuss this morn  the ratio of profit to gdp is at a  record high   momentum continu to be quit strong  with credit spread low  acceler in busi sale  and low ratio of inventori to sale  all these factor seem to speak to some under strength   the manufactur sector  despit some noisi data on job and employ  appear to be in an incred strong posit   the ism manufactur index  pmi  and industri product  which advanc at an annual rate of about     percent dure the second quarter  are all veri posit indic about the manufactur sector   we also continu both to hear anecdot and to see data about real price power in that sector  which is good news on the growth front and probabl give us a coupl of question on the inflat front   final  dino refer at the outset to some of the bottom up analyst es  for profit in the second quarter and the second half  and i said a coupl of meet ago that we should realli take note of these to see whether they flatten out   they appear to be possibl flatten out a touch  but you have to do quit a bit of work to get there   second quarter profit will end up abov     percent onc the s p compani all report   some lower earn guidanc is be given over the forecast period  but throughout that period  earn would still be up    percent or so compar      with similar quarter last year   all of which is quit encourag and come as surpris posit  news to board of director of these compani  who had heard about the slowdown but aren   t see it so dramat  one area about which i spoke earlier was the capit expenditur number in the second  quarter   presid   probabl summar the point well in explain that we should probabl look through that number becaus of some volatil transport relat order  moreov  when i look at the second half of this year and at       other data on unfil order  appear veri posit   pent up demand for cap ex should be higher  given that the past three year  had growth rate of     percent rather than the     percent that we had earlier anticip   the onli other thing i would note about cap ex is that there seem to be greater dispers by industri and by sector   technolog and telecom do seem to be more disciplin in this cap ex wave than mayb mani of us  includ myself  would have anticip   i suspect that  with continu talk about the slowdown in the second half  spend on tech and telecom will be bumpi and may drag some of  the aggreg cap ex number down substanti   as i look at the busi sector  i find myself  ask the key question of whether this industri economi  as robust as i think it is  will boost labor  demand and person incom   i suspect the answer to that question is    yes     but again  it   s hard to  be too definit at this point     on the inflat front  i share the view express by most folk around the tabl of some degre of calm and pleasur about the stabil of inflat expect   but when i think about what has happen to the bond market  particular in the past coupl of week  and the rather robust move that the bond market made at the end of last week  i could be easili persuad that those inflat expect will move against us as data come in between this meet and the next       i would probabl describ mani of these inflat expect as relat calm  but if i had to   guess  i   d say that they   re probabl a bit more wobbl than we would like   further on the bad news front  and i think presid   and presid pool made refer to this  no matter how we slice some of the core pce data and some of the cpi data  even if we look at thing like non energi servic  the trend is not our friend on a three month or six month averag   most of us would not expect it to be our friend over the next six month   again  the question is how persist the trend is  and i have genuin concern on that front   as the  inflat data are like to deterior  we obvious have to look at a broad rang of gdp outcom  for the balanc of        in particular  i took note of the  book   s simul of persist inflat to a   percent core  which i would consid a genuin risk  and although the  book simul suggest that the fed fund rate would need to go onli to     percent  i   m probabl more concern that we might have more work to do if that seri of event came to pass   final  let me quick note the labor compens front   i believ that mani of the gain  shown on that front have been quit surpris on the upsid   they have been good news for most  worker over the past coupl of year  and they help explain that conundrum  which we   ve heard as each of us have sat befor this tabl and been ask on capitol hill   how is it that product is so remark high and compens so remark low   have the gain to trade and to capit and  labor chang   i think these data suggest that they haven   t   if  in fact  we do see continu acceler in compens gain   even  as the  book suggest  to     percent   i suspect the   market again will look to that and will take it at face valu that those gain are like to be more inflationari than mani of us around the tabl believ   i think that   s anoth concern   on balanc  i   d summar my own posit as be consider more concern about the inflat pictur than about the growth pictur   as vice chairman   said  there are     confid interv around all of these that are hard for us to bang the tabl in support of   the  work that we have from this meet to the next will becom particular import   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   as the comment indic  this is probabl the most challeng  e that we have had befor us in my long histori here at the fomc    laughter  the mix of continu inflat pressur and deceler growth are provid more concern on both front than i have heard around the tabl and than i myself have had sinc i   ve been here   first let   s think about some of the growth prospect   i broad share the vice chairman   s view that the fundament are in place for reason growth go forward   certain there are  some risk   but whether we are look at survey base measur  at order and shipment  or at a varieti of differ thing  we don   t realli see sign of veri signific deceler or contract   we see more a moder that would be either in line with the  book or a bit lower than the  book   certain a key risk to growth that a lot of peopl have discuss is residenti invest   if you look at where we are in residenti invest  we   re back onli to mid            and      were incred strong year   so be in      is not that bad   if you look at the graph  residenti   invest fall off rather precipit to get us back to      with great rapid   the question i have is whether it will flatten out or whether it will go down further   the  book forecast have gradual been move down and now reflect more downward pressur go forward   i think that we   re not see the full effect on hous price reflect in the number becaus in the hous market  for reason i don   t think we fulli understand  there tend to be queu rather than just price   chang   so it may take a while for the price data to actual reflect the lower effect price that     peopl are see   obvious hous price will have a potenti import effect on the wealth effect and on consumpt down the line  which i think the  book   a good job of put into place   anoth challeng is elev price for energi and commod   energi price  particular  may be take a littl bite out of peopl   s dispos incom   on the other hand  we have been see continu strong busi fix invest   a small concern i have is  if we continu to hear about slow consumpt and report from wal mart and other that retail is realli slow  whi are these busi produc   are they invest to produc good that peopl will want to buy  or will we see in nine month or a year that mayb some misalloc of  resourc has occur and that thing aren   t as strong as we had thought   there   s no particular sign of such misalloc of invest   it just seem that there is a bit of tension between the  discuss of continu strength of capit expenditur and the statement of busi contact that they are go to continu to invest even though they see a slow come down the line   this  is a variat of what governor   was say   it   s almost as though they are say that some other sector will have that slow  not their sector    in some sens  we should take veri cold comfort from the fact that the economi may be slow   we had quit a discuss about how there   s not much of an inflat   output tradeoff  but at least in this period there are real question of whether you do get much benefit in term of lower inflat from slower growth   there may be some benefit  but it seem to be attenu compar  with the past   obvious some of the recent number on inflat continu to be worrisom  but fortun both the survey measur and the market base measur seem to be reason contain look forward   survey measur  whether of the man in the street or of the profession forecast  seem to be quit flat   the tip rate for both the near term forward and the      longer term forward have not move up much   some of the near term forward have move up a  bit  but that  sn   t seem surpris given the rise in energi price that we have seen both from the middl east and from issu in alaska   the real key is look forward as to what is like to occur   are the thing we   re see  now transitori factor or persist factor   that   s a veri  veri difficult call   reason  argument have been made that a number of these factor  particular with respect to shelter servic  are perhap a bit more short live   shelter servic are about    percent of core pce and about    percent of core cpi  and obvious they have been lead the band up   as mani peopl  have said  we have been see price increas in a lot of area  but i don   t put quit as much stock in that becaus mani of the categori in both the pce and the cpi are arbitrari   the issu is realli what the relat size and the relat import are   shelter servic and owner    equival rent  which compos a vast major of shelter servic  are an import piec   i think that there   s a   reason chanc that this factor is like to be transitori  although it may last for sever month and possibl quarter   but that is the key question   whether these forc are like to be transitori or like to be more persist    come back to inflat expect  that   s realli where i see the market both regist their view of persist and tell us someth about whether they believ that we will keep inflat well contain   at least so far  those expect are suggest that we will   it   s extrem import that we maintain those expect   it   s veri cost to tri to regain credibl if credibl is lost   i think the market are will to say     well  there may be some transitori inflat  and we   re will to wait and see whether to mark up our longer term expect     certain onc longer term expect are mark up  the situat becom high problemat becaus it   s veri difficult to rein in the chang in expect  particular in behavior   so      basic i think we need to keep a veri  veri watch eye on where expect are go   i   m  hearten that they haven   t move too far despit  as mani peopl have said  high core pce price for a number of year and elev level in the most recent number   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   let me briefli summar what i   ve heard and add a few comment   i think one thing we can conclud is that this is not get ani easier   laughter   start with the data  which are not cooper  the nipa revis show that   potenti growth may be less than we thought and  therefor  we may have to have more of a slowdown  if we believ in the phillip curv  to begin to contain inflat   the small bit of comfort i take is that the slowdown in potenti and product appear to be come from capit rather than from multifactor product  so at least that technolog compon still seem to be with us   the question is whether we are  in fact  slow to potenti or to slight below potenti   i agre with most of what i heard around the tabl  which is that there is evid of slow but  except for the residenti construct sector  it is not yet at all definit that we are fall below potenti growth rate   for exampl  the staff es  that gdp growth in the second quarter was    percent   the staff also es  that the slower rate of job creation we saw in the second quarter is still fair close to what is need to keep the unemploy rate constant   we are certain see area of strength in the economi  as a number of peopl note   that includ the industri sector   which will grow     or     percent  someth like that  overal in juli   and nonresidenti construct  which has been strong enough that so far there has not been  a net declin in construct job in the unit state   so there certain are some strong element of the economi       i   d like to talk about the veri import hous sector  in term not of the expect level but of the varianc of our forecast  which i think we must think about given our risk manag approach   at least three dimens of the hous sector provid signific uncertainti as we look forward   the first is the extent to which sale  start  and permit will declin   the correct in the hous market so far appear to be fair substanti   in       we had      million start   for june  the number of adjust permit was      million   we alreadi have a    percent declin in the  level of construct   as governor   point out  the curv  sn   t look as though it   s flatten out  it look as though it   s head direct south   we have heard anecdot that cancel are up veri sharpli   inventori are rise signific  and i note that  just sinc the  last meet  the gdp contribut es  by the staff for hous construct went from minus     percent to minus     percent   so there is  i think  a lot of uncertainti about where that sector is go to level out   second  associ with that consider is a lot of uncertainti about hous price  again  as governor   note  we don   t realli have much inform on what the    true price    of hous is at this point becaus of the way this market work   peopl leav thing on the  market for a long  e  they take them off the market  they provid incent  and so on   so we don   t realli see the transact price in ani kind of qualiti adjust or reliabl way for some  e after the declin begin   the price are signific  of cours  both becaus they affect the profit of futur construct and becaus they are  at this point  an import compon of household wealth  we know that these factor are like to affect spend   final  a third element of uncertainti as we look into the forecast is what i would call paramet risk  which is that the staff assum that the effect of hous wealth on consumpt  spend is  through the standard wealth effect  about four cent on the dollar   i happen to think that     is a good es    i think the econometr calcul are persuas   nevertheless  there is the possibl that the effect is somewhat greater  perhap oper through liquid effect   there may be buffer stock effect   if peopl see their equiti fall  they may becom more cautious about spend in order to avoid elimin their buffer of reserv   thus there is the possibl that hous will have a stronger effect on consumpt than we now expect   i don   t know what the expect growth rate is   if i had to take a guess  i would say that  we   re go to be close to or slight below potenti go forward  but i simpli want to point out that our forecast may have a higher varianc now than it   under normal circumst   let me say just a few word about inflat   i heard a lot of concern about inflat around the tabl   i certain share that concern  and i don   t expect ani near term improv  if for no other reason than that these thing tend to be high inerti   i also agre with the general  observ that the pickup is fair broad base  as i discuss in the meet last  e   one indic of that is the share of good that have price increas or price increas abov a certain level    i tri a somewhat differ exercis  and i didn   t do it in ani way as an apologist for inflat   i want to be veri clear   but i think it   s use to look at inflat from a differ approach  which is to ask what share of the inflat acceler is attribut to differ compon   so i ask for a look at the past three month versus the past twelv month to examin the acceler between those two period   in a sort of growth account exercis  how can we distribut that acceler among differ compon   i have just a few observ from that exercis   first  the shelter compon realli    play a big role   for exampl  in this particular calcul  which is somewhat sensit to sampl period  of the    basi point increas in the core cpi between twelv month and three month          basi point were associ with the shelter increas   so that compon is signific  and our view on where it will go and how that relat to the develop in the hous market need to be thought about   a second observ is that we are see energi pass through  a good exampl be air fare  which have jump signific and which by themselv contribut    basi point to the acceler   so energi pass through is real   a somewhat more subtl point  which was made in the  book and which i think is interest  is that there   s a littl differ behavior between inflat in good and inflat in non energi  nonshelt servic   inflat in servic has  been general flat   in good  howev  we have seen a bit of acceler  from a negat number in       to a slight posit number in         exampl would be the rise in price in apparel and  more recent  in use car   in just examin clue  i think that acceler might say someth about intern competit  the effect of the declin dollar  and the possibl that import competit has weaken to some extent and is allow price of tradabl good to rise a bit more quick     one theme that is consist regard the energi pass through and the perhap slight greater inflat in tradabl good is that an import compon of the inflat is product market tight as oppos to labor market tight   that suggest that  as we go forward  we should pay a lot of attent to final demand and consumpt and see how they are affect the product market   my own guess is that unit labor cost and wage will be somewhat lag  and i think that  if the product market slow and the slow reduc price power  as we call it  those effect   will ul  have effect on the markup that will offset some of the wage effect   so those are just a few observ about the economi   to summar  i agre with the sen ent around the tabl that there is a lot of uncertainti go forward  particular in the hous sector  but that the inflat risk at this point are still domin and that our polici action and     statement should reflect the greater concern with inflat   on the subject of polici  let me now turn to    who will present the polici option
as shown in the top panel of exhibit    the probabl of a    basi point firm at this meet impli by feder fund futur quot trend down over the intermeet period   polici expect were boost briefli by higher than expect inflat read  but those increas were more than offset by feder reserv polici communic and sever econom data releas   most recent  the juli employ report   that came in weaker than market particip had anticip   the pattern of declin expect of firm at the upcom meet stand in sharp contrast to the previous experi in this tighten cycl  in which market expect of firm general rose over intermeet period  converg to a level close to     percent by a day befor the fomc meet   but the current situat is similar to the previous episod in that market arriv at a high degre of certainti about the outcom sever day in advanc of the meet   still  as shown in the middl left panel  primari dealer respond to the desk   s survey have  sinc last novemb  evidenc both increas disagr among

  although dealer expect your statement to cite inflat risk  impli a likelihood of further polici firm  slight less than half see ani further tighten in this cycl  and all of those anticip at most   point either today or in septemb  as shown by the black line in the bottom left hand panel  the peak of rate impli by fed fund futur at just      percent suggest that investor see onli   in   odd that you will take anoth firm step in this cycl   inde  look further ahead  the black line in the middl panel illustr that market particip continu to anticip polici eas to commenc befor long  and their project downward trajectori for the feder fund rate steepen somewhat over the intermeet period  investor seem to remain surpris assur in these view   as shown in the right hand panel  measur of market uncertainti about polici six and twelv month ahead  the black and the blue line  respect  have crept higher of late but are quit low by histor standard   reflect our own sens of uncertainti about the committe   s futur action  in the august bluebook we present four  rather than the usual three  altern for    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix            committe

involv a    basi point firm today but are similar differenti by their risk assess   a case for hold the feder fund rate unchang today is summar in the top left hand panel of exhibit     base on an assumpt of an unchang feder fund rate  the staff forecast is for econom growth to run slight below the expans of the economi   s potenti over the next six quarter   as shown in the top right hand panel  real gdp growth is project to averag about    percent over the second half of      and       and the unemploy rate is forecast to creep up to    percent   the negat output gap that develop by the end of next year is small and exert onli veri modest restraint on inflat  but the level out of energi price that was assum in the staff forecast has a more notic effect  and core pce inflat in the  book edg down slowli over the forecast period   should the committe find this outlook like and  in the circumst  accept  it might be inclin to maintain it current stanc at this meet    the model base

polici action have brought the real feder fund rate from a quit low level to the middl of the rang of es  of the equilibrium  shown in red    this configur might  provid some comfort that leav the stanc of polici unchang for six week is unlik to turn out to be a serious mistak   that is  unless the committe is particular concern that inflat expect could becom unmoor by further bad news on inflat in circumst in which polici evid had gone on hold   moreov  some monetari polici rule report in the bluebook suggest hold polici steadi at this meet   for exampl  the first differ rule use an inflat target of   percent  which is portray to the right  point to onli   point of addit polici firm through the end of next year  base on the staff baselin forecast   howev  even if the committe thought that leav the stanc of polici unchang was appropri for this meet  it might   as note immedi below the panel   continu to see sever sourc of upsid risk to inflat   most notabl  high level of

factor   the latter possibl highlight by ye day   s news from alaska   in these circumst  the committe might see the languag of altern b  communic a judgment that    some inflat risk remain    and referenc a potenti need to address those risk  as appropri in conjunct with an unchang stanc of polici   at the same  e  the committe might perceiv emerg downsid risk to the econom outlook  as note in the first bullet in the bottom left hand panel   output     and employ have deceler substanti in recent month  and certain a sharper than expect further deceler cannot be rule out   in particular

policymak follow the bluebook   s outcom base rule respond to emerg slack by lower the feder fund rate to    percent by the end of next year   even without particular concern about such risk  an

in the op  control polici path with an inflat target of   percent  moreov  the committe   s past behavior as captur in the es  forecast base rule would  as shown in the bottom right hand panel  suggest a slight eas of polici  given the staff outlook   in these circumst  the committe might find it reason to leav the stanc of polici unchang at this meet and not have ani predilect for the like

firm polici anoth notch at this meet   if the committe saw signific potenti for inflat to exceed expect  it might believ that anoth    basi point increas in the feder fund rate is necessari to balanc the risk  altern  the committe might feel  given the alreadi relat high level of inflat  that a signific upsid surpris to inflat could be quit damag and would exceed the cost of a downsid surpris to growth   if so  the committe might be will to tighten polici a bit further to provid more insur against persist high inflat   the committe might also believ that a rate increas today could be a use signal of it anti inflationari resolv while  as under altern c  suggest that it was not necessarili expect to firm polici further    all that said  member may have reserv in current circumst about suggest that the risk are balanc  even after the    basi point firm of altern c   such reserv may motiv the committe to consid altern d  discuss in the remaind of your exhibit   under this altern  the committe would both rais the feder fund rate    basi point at this meet and impli that further increas may well be in store   as note in the middl panel  member might be inclin to adopt altern d for sever reason   first  the committe might agre that the staff forecast present the most like outcom for the economi and inflat should the feder fund rate be held at it current level over come quarter  but it may prefer a steeper declin in inflat than in that forecast and be will to toler a slower pace of econom growth to achiev it   inde  as reproduc in the bottom left hand panel  the op  control simul present in chart   of the bluebook suggest that consider polici firm lie ahead if the committe want to pursu a     percent inflat object   especi should it seek to attain that rate within a few year   the committe also might believ that appreci further polici firm could be in prospect becaus it   not expect      growth to slow as much as the staff expect or becaus it is concern that inflat pressur could turn out to be more durabl than forecast by the staff  a risk that is illustr by the    persist inflat    scenario   as shown by the black line in the bottom right hand panel  if those increment inflat pressur were fulli anticip  op  polici would call for boost the feder fund rate about    basi point abov baselin over the next year   in the op  control case with gradual learn  the dash red line  or with the empir es  rule tha   react onli to outcom  the dash blue line  the polici respons is more drawn out but is eventu of similar dimens   should the committe see a signific risk of persist inflat pressur along these line  it may wish to continu to point to upsid risk in it announc if it firm    basi point at this meet  as in altern d   your final exhibit is the version of tabl   that was distribut on friday   thank you   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   ani question for     presid
i have one question about the term    resourc util      it was in our statement last  e  and we took it out of mani of the altern   i think   mention that resourc util was a bit tighter sinc our last meet   i was wonder whether there was a particular reason for take it out of mani of the option that we have to consid here
it   s in altern c
it is in altern c  as presid   mention   i think it   s simpli a question of whether or not the committe prefer to speak in those term  whether it would like to  mention that factor at this meet   i don   t think the staff has a strong view on whether or not it should be includ
you do not have a strong view

ani other question   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i found this a challeng meet for arriv at a polici conclus   i certain agre with mani of you that inflat has been run higher than we want for longer than we have want  and i activ debat whether we should continu on our  tighten path   but in the end  i think there are a number of advantag to keep polici unchang but be veri care to talk about the upsid risk to inflat that we see   one of those  advantag is that the staff may actual be right    laughter   keep polici at this rate may be  consist with a moder of inflat over come quarter   even if inflat  sn   t moder quit as fast as some of us might want it to  at least it   s on the right  downward  track   in my  previous remark i cite a few thing that lead me to think that that   s a nontrivi possibl   one is  that we have had some evid that growth is slow to at least the growth rate of potenti and mayb a littl below   second  i do think that some of the influenc that we   ve seen on inflat are transitori  as governor   said  and will lessen over  e   so i think that keep the polici rate where it is could well be consist with make progress toward our object of stabl price and maximum employ over  e    becaus there   s a strong expect in the market  not     percent but around    percent  that we won   t do anyth  i think that  if we keep polici unchang but continu to express consider concern about inflat risk  there will be veri littl market reaction in term of the expect interest rate further out on the curv   that would impli to me that financi condit won   t be loosen by our keep polici unchang   talk about inflat risk will also preserv our flexibl for the futur   we   ll let the market know what we   re most worri about  and keep polici unchang while talk about inflat risk will give us some of that flexibl  which would be veri  veri import given the uncertainti   there are downsid risk to growth as well as the risk that inflat will remain higher   express the concern about     inflat but keep polici unchang get us off what chairman bernank call    the escal    of    basi point a meet   the situat is such that it would be a good idea to get off that escal and have that flexibl without signal that we think we   re done but just that we   re stop for today   in term of the languag of the statement  i   m not sure that altern b fulli express the  concern that i heard around the tabl about inflat risk   presid   rais one of those issu   that the altern b languag has noth about high level of resourc util   i think high resourc util is a risk   one suggest would be to take the languag in altern c under section   and put it in altern b as perhap a better express of what the committe   s  concern are  even while keep polici unchang   that would speak to presid     s point   anoth word that was drop from the announc was    product    as damp inflat   i think that   s a close call as well   product growth remain veri strong   the staff has mark down onli a littl it expect path of product  which remain pretti high compar with histori   at the same  e  with compens increas  labor cost are not realli hold  down inflat and aren   t expect to hold it down in the futur   so i could go either way in term of includ a refer to product   to me  delet it would indic that the unit labor cost path that we had for hold down inflat  which we cite last  e  isn   t there anymor   but it is a fact that product continu to be strong   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you veri much   in my memori  this is about the toughest decis i   ve ever been a part of at this tabl   over the past twelv  thirteen  or so year that i   ve been here  we haven   t face the combin of potenti for slower growth and rise inflat that is certain     not op  for a central bank  and i realli do find this choic to be veri difficult along the line that don mention earlier   not onli do we have to figur out what to do  we have to figur out what to say about it  and that   s anoth complic factor that has just grown over the year   we began rais interest rate more than two year and     basi point ago  but at some point we have to stop or at least paus   what make this particular difficult is that price growth is on an uptick and moder occur onli in project and not yet in the data   i think you  ben  anticip in one of your earlier tes oni   perhap in the first one you  gave   that we might have to paus in the midst of advers incom price data   the thought wasn   t  well receiv at the  e  as i recal  and now that we   re face with that decis  i find myself uncomfort   the logic is clear   inflat data are backward look  and if we continu to increas rate until incom inform suggest that moder has occur  we will undoubt overdo the tighten process   but know that  sn   t make choos when to stop or even to paus easier when you see  as i do  mani risk that both growth and inflat pressur may well be stronger than we now forecast   in that regard  i think don and i are probabl just micromeasur away from each other  but i   m sort of on the other side of the line   at the margin i favor increas the feder fund rate    basi point   i believ inflat risk are on the upsid and that we   re at risk that the current  higher rate of inflat will becom embed in busi practic and  therefor  get reflect in  the market expect and the expect that we measur   i don   t think we   re way behind the curv  but i do think we need to ensur that polici stay less rather than more accommod   as i note earlier  if one look at real interest rate  among other thing  financi condit are more  rather than less accommod than earlier in the summer  and i person don   t think that   s consist with the inflat risk that we face       now  don point out that the market is not anticip this   for some reason or anoth  the market saw the minut of our last meet as veri soft   i didn   t read them that way   as i recal our discuss at the last meet  we want to give ourselv some flexibl   we would be happi if the market saw a       chanc   probabl reflect on growth in q  that was slower than they expect and on some of the employ data  they   ve obvious tilt it the other way   i recogn that surpris the market with an increas would be a surpris   laughter  but i   m not at all sure that   s a bad thing  particular if we are as concern about inflat around the tabl as i have heard mani of us say   i recogn that i may be in the minor here   so i would strong advoc that  if we do   talk about paus  we not suggest to the market that we think the risk in the economi are   balanc   we have to signal clear that our concern are on the upsid with regard to inflat   if i were a vote member  i   d vote to rais the fed fund rate    basi point and to use some form of  altern c  possibl by adjust the last line to indic an ongo concern about inflat but probabl not go all the way in the direct of altern d   i recogn that   s not like to be the consensus here   so then i would strong favor altern b in term of languag  with the  chang that don just mention   take section   and move it into altern b   to perhap give a stronger cast to the overal assess
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern b   it is a tough decis   i  person consid this the wiser cours of action  although i think there   s no question that a case  can be made for rais rate today   altern b has sever advantag   first  a paus at this meet will give us a chanc to review incom data over the next six week  which isn   t that     long   we need a chanc to better ascertain where the economi is head and whether the elev level of inflat we have seen are persist   i think there is signific downsid risk to growth  as i mention  with hous be a particular acut exampl   i think our polici are take a bite out of econom momentum  and i agre with the analysi that our chairman gave of at least the downsid risk from that sourc   i am also disturb by the trajectori of core inflat over the first half of the year   we   ll see two  cpi report and other data by the next meet  and i think mayb they will help us sort out just how sustain the rise in inflat is truli like to be   as i said  there   s no doubt in my mind that you can make a good case for rais rate today  and frank i probabl would have end up favor that myself  despit the associ risk to growth  if i thought there were an immin danger of our lose our inflat fight credibl  with the market and the general public   but that   s not the case at all in my view   the market don   t expect us to rais rate today   yet inflat expect are contain   presid   has emphas  and i agre with this  that we cannot take our credibl for grant   econom model that allow for imperfect credibl show that  when a central bank lack full credibl  it should respond somewhat more aggress to inflat than would be op  if it were complet  credibl  which is presid     s point   i agre with that   but such model don   t impli that the central bank should act as if price stabil were the sole object   in the current context  that suggest to me that our credibl is like to be preserv as long as we continu to respond to econom condit in a manner that is basic consist with the pattern that the committe has establish over the past decad  which is similar to  say  a modifi version of the taylor rule   i think that   s what we   ve been do and essenti should continu to do       an advantag of altern b  and i think this is import  is that it   suggest concern  with inflat risk   i complet agre that we should express that concern   i expect and i hope that inflat is go to edg down  but i don   t have a great deal of confid in that forecast   i  would not want to see a statement suggest that inflat risk are balanc at the present  e  i  think it would be mislead   our statement should  in effect  contain an asymmetr bias toward tighten  and that   s true whether we actual rais rate or we don   t rais rate   so i would oppos  altern a and c  and i have no object to substitut the languag from altern c for that in b as governor kohn suggest   i find it hard to predict what the market reaction is go to be  but the languag could end  up rais the market   s expect concern futur rate   i would consid that appropri in light of the fact that standard polici rule and op  polici report in the bluebook do suggest  that some further increas in the fed fund rate are like to be call for in come month   our communic should be consist with that analysi and not indic that we think we   re probabl done     so what   s the advantag of altern b   we can get off the escal of    basi point per  meet  take a paus  and evalu incom data without say that we think we   re done with the tighten phase   i do worri that a market psycholog has develop that suggest that the minut we stop rais rate we   re absolut finish   in contrast to the  book   s trajectori  which is that we   re go to stay here for a while and not quick revers  market now appar anticip  a rather rapid polici revers   the  book assumpt is a more sensibl posit   it would be a more sensibl set of market expect than the idea that we will have a quick revers   it would not be unwelcom to me at all to see the market trajectori for the futur bounc up
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   with each speaker  this discuss get more and more interest   i think it   s fair to say that anybodi who has been involv in the   policymak process for veri long has made a speech or talk public about how you come to the meet with your own view and you   re alway will to listen to your colleagu and chang  your mind   i come probabl as close to that phenomenon today as i have in my ten year at the tabl    as i listen to the discuss that we had earlier  i guess i was a bit surpris at how great the concern about inflat is   i share it certain to a great extent   i think that one could  in fact   make a veri strong case for a further tighten move today    it seem to me  howev  that a  tighten move today would have to come with an express of continu concern about inflat   that  i think  would impli probabl addit tighten move   if combin with the notion that we   re not satisfi that the path we   re on will get inflat down well within the rang  a tighten move today impli an even greater likelihood of further tighten   i think that kind of path rais the probabl that we   re go to do too much and stay too long at this   not to    me   too    your comment  but perhap becaus i come from the southeast  where hous is such an   import factor   though i   m not sure i understand complet the slowdown in hous and how import that may turn out to be   it is certain a factor in my mind   i   m will to give more  weight to the op ist forecast on inflat than it sound as though some are   i appreci the   price power discuss that we   ve heard around the tabl  but we have been hear that for year   and i would hope that the same thing that kept that from play out would continu keep it from play out   again  one could  in fact  make a veri honor case for a further tighten move today   but that   s not where i came in  and that   s not where i end up after the discuss   i think in some     way that   s a harder conclus to come to  but i still favor someth like altern b   it would be veri good for us to demonstr the willing to paus and tri to understand the thing that are go on a littl better than we do   i am will to trust  perhap more than some are  that the  forecast inflat is go to work it way down   i am less obsess than some with tri to push it  all the way down to     percent in the veri short term   i don   t think that the world would expect and insist that we do that    we have enough credibl that we should use a bit of it now to give ourselv  e to see where we are   if our forecast that thing are go to be okay turn out to be wrong  we can chang our posit rather quick and regain whatev loss of credibl somebodi think we may have  incur   again  all thing consid  i favor no chang in polici today and languag similar to what   s in altern b   i do not intend to dissent today if the consensus is on the side of tighten  but i have a reason strong prefer for use this opportun to take a break in the path we   ve been on and to tri to understand a bit better where we are   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
gee  what can i say    laughter   it   s a veri difficult call  and inde  i  consid myself realli fortun that i happen to be in on this discuss in my first  e   mayb  there are some advantag and disadvantag to that   mayb i don   t carri some of the baggag of what i   ve said in past meet becaus i haven   t said anyth in past meet   i certain understand and respect the view express by those who think we should paus  i think that most peopl around this tabl recogn that reason peopl at this stage do sound econom analysi could come down one way or the other on this   but at this point  my inclin is to favor a    basi point increas   econom growth has slow from the rapid pace that we   ve all been talk about   this was expect   i see littl reason to think  at least base on what i   ve     heard around the tabl today  that growth will be consider below trend in the second half of this year or into          i don   t think that hold rate steadi at this  e will add much to real growth in the near term  nor do i think it   s realli buy us much insur against possibl futur weak   by the  same token  i don   t think rais rate    basi point is go to have a signific effect on the real   economi in the near term either  but it can help reinforc the public   s percept of our commit to price stabil   i believ that the committe has done an outstand job in maintain credibl thus far  as evidenc by the fact that we   ve all note that longer term inflationari expect seem to be well anchor   but longer term expect remain contain becaus the  market and peopl expect the fomc to contain actual inflat   thus  we have to be veri care not to presum that expect will remain stabl independ of our action today or in subsequ meet   if the committe choos not to rais rate    it risk send the messag that we are will to toler inflat abov an accept level for a signific period of  e   if we take the   book   s forecast as our point forecast  as has been repeat said  it will basic say that we   re prepar to toler pce core inflat in excess of   percent for four year or perhap more  send that messag may generat increas uncertainti about our commit to low inflat  and if inflat expect becom unhing as a result  that would lead to some veri bad  outcom given the cost impos on the economi as we strive to regain our credibl   i recogn that a rate increas may come as a surpris to the market  but i   m less sure that  over a slight longer period  it won   t inde be good news for the market and for the economi as a whole   thus  as i see it  the argument for favor anoth move today is base on a comparison of the potenti cost and benefit   paus is not free   in my view  paus today would do littl for     growth in the near term  nor   it help us on our credibl side   i believ the potenti cost of  tighten a bit more in term of bad outcom for growth and employ are outweigh by the  potenti cost of not do so  given where inflat is and where we think it   s go   if the economi   s growth prospect deterior signific in the come week and month  we clear have the opportun to paus or even reduc rate if we think do so is necessari    in contrast  i ask myself     how difficult will it be  if we paus today  to resum rate increas if we need to do so      this question lead to think about the languag of the statement   if we choos to paus today  it   s import that we send a clear and veri strong signal with our statement languag that we are commit to price stabil   point out that inflat pressur are  like to moder over  e is import if we believ that to be the case becaus we need to explain whi  despit inflat abov our comfort zone  we aren   t act   point out that some  inflat risk remain would help convey the idea that we may need to act in the futur to bring inflat down if our forecast turn out to be wrong   so i   d like to close by suggest that each of us need to ask ourselv the follow question   what inform are we like to see in the next six week that would caus us  if we paus today  to initi anoth rate increas in septemb   what might caus us to cut rate in  septemb   and in the event that data on the real economi are onc again a bit muddl  as they were in the past six week  and inflat continu unab  will we find ourselv in the posit  of inertia that would lead us to continu paus and then would possibl put us further behind the curv   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
as i outlin earlier  my sens is that  after have larg elimin resourc underutil  the economi is now fluctuat around potenti   it   s attract in     circumst like this to look back to similar period for an independ gaug on the appropri level of real interest rate   from      through       anoth period of sustain real growth around potenti  the real feder fund rate relat to lag core pce inflat rang  between    percent and   percent   right now  the real feder fund rate measur the same way is     percent   this is handili illustr  by the way  by the black line in the bluebook   s chart     you can do this calcul yourself use ani number of altern method of es  inflat expect  and you alway get the same result   the real feder fund rate was never this low between      and         as an asid  a deeper scientif analysi of the appropri level of the real interest rate would take into account the insight  date back at least to irv    that it ought to reflect the relat balanc of pressur on current versus futur resourc   intertempor rate of substitut  in other word   clear  ani gaug of that is go to relat real rate to current demand relat to the potenti for the economi to suppli it   so in ani statist relationship es  over histor data  one is go to uncov a relationship between real rate and output   a monetari polici maker sure can   t ignor output  and i wouldn   t advoc do that   one import differ between now and the late     s is that inflat was better behav then   inflat fell from just over   percent in      to just below   percent in       and it stay in the middl of the   to   percent rang for the rest of that decad   now  as mani have note  inflat is go in the opposit direct   briefli  it has been abov   percent sinc earli       and has step up signific sinc the begin of the year   the  book is project that it will remain abov    percent for a year and a half   it now appear as if an acceler of wage inflat has begun   although one might character   as mani around the     tabl have   inflat expect as    well contain     i think it   s worth question whether the level at which expect measur are contain is that reassur    i   ll note that the tip inflat compens figur taken from last friday afternoon show that  adjust for the carri effect  the ten year spread is       the five year spread five year ahead is      and the one year forward rate end in ten year is        adjust that to get back to core pce  the first thing you do is take overal to core  the expect valu of that is sure around zero go forward   then  there   s this cpi to pce measur error   if you chart that  you see it has fluctuat a lot   sure  the histor averag is     percentag point  but it has been negat for sever quarter  and just now it has gotten back to     or     or so   so let   s take      the bluebook   s adjust   if you expect long run inflat expect to accord with the opinion of some around this tabl   that they would like to see inflat within a comfort zone between   and   percent   you   d expect core inflat of     percent  and you   d expect these inflat expect measur to be     percent   if you look at the survey evid  they are at           and     percent   so it   s not clear that inflat compens and inflat expect measur are contain in a way that   s consist with a long run inflat object around     percent   in short  if you sum up all the inflat evid  take the whole pictur togeth  to my mind it look a lot as though inflat has becom entrench abov   percent  in my view  the longer we let it go on  as a previous chairman and this chairman have said  the more difficult it will be to correct it   the wors inflat outlook now indic that  if anyth  the real short rate should be higher than otherwis warrant by real growth consider   on top of that  there is the   relationship to take into account  as presid   point out   sinc the june meet  the      book   s one year ahead inflat forecast has risen    basi point  so a    percent fed fund rate now correspond to a    basi point lower real rate than it did in june   as i said earlier  i think a fair scientif apprais of the evid should make us deepli skeptic of the notion that moder growth is go to bring core inflat down without further action on our part to better anchor inflat expect   yet a popular percept now is that this hypothesi is the centerpiec of our inflat strategi   i believ we need to take action today to correct that misapprehens   i do not believ we live in a world in which it is common knowledg that we follow a fix polici reaction function that includ among it argument or determin a singl number captur a well known long run inflat object for us   for exampl  the taylor rule that has a singl number      that captur where inflat return and to which ani impuls respons  function you run is go to return in five or ten year   i believ  rather  that our recent experi clear demonstr that there have been substanti swing in the public   s belief about futur inflat and monetari polici   in other word  about what kind of policymak we are   moreov  i believ that the public is confus about how monetari polici and inflat should respond to energi price shock   i think this confus aros in the wake of katrina  and i think it has been exacerb by our failur to explain that fact well enough to the public  even though we have all tri   more energi shock are like in the year ahead  and we need to condit market to expect us to protect core inflat in respons rather than attempt to protect the unemploy rate as we did in the     s   i think the first order polici problem for us today is to influenc the evolut of the public   s belief in a way that help bring inflat down more rapid than the public and the  book are current forecast  rather than reli on subsid special factor   in theori      a forc enough communic about our intent to act in the futur could be an effect substitut for action today  but i am skeptic about this hypothesi as well   we have been quit care to say that  if we paus  we could resum rate short thereaft   but everi  e we say that  the market reaction seem to be     did you say   paus         this has the market focus on the possibl of our paus and less focus on the possibl of our resum afterward  and that is clear reflect in what the yield curv has done sinc the last meet  as illustr in the bluebook   in sum  i acknowledg the case for below potenti growth over the next few quarter  as low as the staff believ   if i expect signific lower growth than i do  i would obvious favor a lower real interest rate path than i otherwis would   but i think that the risk that the hous contract will have broader multipli effect on person consumpt and other sector is still relat small  and i do not think we should be satisfi with the path that inflat is like to take if we stay on the polici path that the market anticip  communic is import  as we   ll discuss later today  but there are  e when action speak louder than word   therefor i favor a    basi point increas in the feder fund rate and a  statement someth like altern d  and i favor them enough to vote accord
thank you   presid  n
thank you   well  like other  i have ask myself whether this is the appropri  e to paus   i think there are respect and reason argument on both side of that question  and so let me briefli make a coupl of them   in favor of the paus now is the observ  which i would reiter  that i do believ inflat expect are well anchor and have remain well anchor despit develop that we might have expect to have concern peopl in the marketplac  name higher     inflat number in realiti and an appar grow convict among mani market particip that a paus in our polici tighten action is like to be forthcom   the second argument concern the well known lag between our polici action and their effect   i wish i knew more about those lag  to be precis  than i do  but it still seem to me it   s a good bet that we have not seen the full effect of the action we have alreadi taken   the third argument is that market particip are expect a paus at this point  or at least mani are   on the other hand  inflat has been more rapid so far this year than i had expect  and it is probabl not a good bet that it will deceler any  soon   this persist of inflat could have deleteri consequ for inflat expect unless we communic particular effect go forward  if we do paus   with hindsight  look at the cours of polici over the past three or four year  i think that it   s at least possibl that polici was too accommod for too long  thus  we have more work to do to counteract those effect   when i weigh those argument and think about some of the other argument i have heard around the tabl  i come down in favor of a paus at this meet and in favor of someth like altern b   it   s veri import that we avoid give the impress that we may be done  and i think altern b larg   that   i am reluct to wade into the morass of edit on the run  but if we want to strengthen that altern  i think we could actual do it with one word in section    third line  by just say    owe onli in part to the pass through      the thought i have is that the    onli    signal that we   re not simpli suggest this is all transitori and all due to special factor   but that   s just a suggest
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   as other are  i am veri torn about this decis   i come out for hold the fund rate constant  and here is the problem that i have with our situat   part of it is the languag that we use in the past   if you look at the first exhibit that we were given  you see that the fed fund rate respond to the second quarter gdp report and the employ report   we have told the market that we are go to be data depend  and we have told the market that resourc   util matter to us   it seem to me that the lesson from that is  first  we should come through with what we told the market we were go to do and  second  we should get some of those thing out of the statement becaus we need to put a lot more emphasi on the inflat risk that we face go forward   i am particular unhappi  quit frank  with leav the refer to hous in there   hous is like to continu to have some weak number  and it seem to me that we don   t want the market to believ that polici is realli be driven by one sector of the economi   i offer some languag for section     i think that is a statement about the past      has moder from it quit strong pace      if you just look at the second quarter gdp report  there was moder pretti much across the board   that was the languag i suggest   i think we  ought not to be refer to hous explicit   we should tri to move toward a bare bone statement and not creat expect in the market that we are go to be respond   of cours  between now and our next meet we may get some more measur that peopl would interpret as reflect resourc util   one of the thing that is peculiar about have that in the statement at this point is that the staff is not forecast ani signific gap in resourc util that would put downward pressur on inflat   so how can we be refer to resourc util as our primari reason for think     that inflat is go to moder   it seem to me that there is some intern inconsist  there   the problem that i have with altern b  as it is now word  is this   if we believ that we will want to increas the target fund rate at our next meet   which i think is the interpret of that last section   then we should do it today   we shouldn   t signal it for the futur   given that expect seem to be well contain  i think that we have a chanc to use our languag to get out from under some of the expect we have creat and that we should come through on the expect we have alreadi creat   you see that clear in the way the market set the fed fund rate in respons to the incom data   we   ve said we were go to be data depend  and i think we   d better come through and be data depend   i want to say one other thing about hous   i think that hous may be tell us that it is realli a good measur of consum confid   hous obvious involv peopl look forward and decid what commit they   re will to make   i would interpret hous as be a combin measur of peopl   s attitud toward the futur  the secur of their incom flow  and the commit they   re will to make   to includ obvious not onli the household themselv but also the lender that are respons for make mortgag decis  so i would downplay hous as a direct compon of gdp   thank you
mr  chairman   may i ask mr  pool a clarifi question
so  bill  you would want to do what to expect  how would you want expect to evolv in respons to your prefer version of the languag associ with a paus today   do you want them to be flat go forward
well  in term of what we know today  i think we ought to be noncommitt   if we continu to get inform that lead to extend the inflat risk or mayb indic that it is more sever even than we think today  then we ought to be respond to that  and we ought to leav ourselv open to be respond to that   we shouldn   t write ourselv into a box by focus on resourc util becaus those number are in mani way the most visibl one to lot of peopl   suppos we get anoth low number on the august employ report  and we have point to resourc util as one of the thing that we   re count on   are we then write ourselv into a box in term of the expect we creat by emphas resourc util   so that   s whi i   m argu for a veri  veri general and rather vagu statement
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   like other  i think the polici action at this meet is a veri close call  but in the end i support a paus  even in light of the continu unfavor inflat situat   i think that there is a real possibl that slack could be greater dure this project period than the staff   s baselin project expect becaus of weaker demand  stronger potenti  or some combin of the two   i am encourag that inflat expect remain anchor   in light of all of the uncertainti attach to the current outlook  i would just like to take a paus and see how thing play out   now  as mani have said  there is a chanc that the data are go to reveal that this is not a good stop point   if the data do reveal that more rate hike are in order becaus inflat may reacceler  becaus inflat expect begin to increas  or becaus econom activ appear to be more robust than our current project  then i think we will need to consid the possibl of a more aggress  move   unfortun  i think it   s unrealist to expect that some of these issu are go to be     resolv in one or two futur meet   but we have market base measur of inflat expect that are avail to us on a continu basi  and for that reason  it seem import to me to be especi focus on inflat expect in the come month    i favor altern b   i support governor kohn   s suggest that we move languag from altern c  section    to emphas our concern about the inflat risk   i also want to add that  like presid guynn  i am not go to dissent if the consensus is for a move of    basi point   i came into the meet lean toward a paus   i have to say  after listen to mani of my colleagu    statement today  that inclin is less pronounc   it   s just a veri close call today   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i don   t think i   ll surpris you   i agre with governor kohn that a paus is appropri   in term of some of the comment  i do suggest that we need to recogn that we often say that monetari polici oper with a lag   in fact  move that we have made have not yet work their way through  and we ought to see how they  develop   a paus is appropri to do that   it   s not shut off further move but let us look at the fact that are in play   with that  i am bother that the market are alreadi project that  some  in the futur  we will revers and begin to lower rate  which i think is not someth i would like to see   also  becaus i recogn that there are genuin and serious inflat risk  we need to be    and to express that we are   veri sensit in watch inflat expect   part of our judgment will be not just on real econom data but on these expect and on what inflat    sinc that is our busi   if i could say someth in this languag  it would be to the     effect that i think we are restrict  mayb moder restrict  and that we   re go to stay that way until we see systemat declin in inflat   i think that would do a lot for us   have said that  in term of the languag  i would then be comfort with altern b  with the modif that governor kohn has suggest  as we tri to clarifi our intent  if that   s what we want to do with this statement  move forward
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i think it was in march that i refer to pascal   s famous wager about the exist of god   pascal   s view was basic that if you look far out in the futur from a risk manag standpoint  the answer was in the affirm    laughter   i happen to accept the exist of inflat  and i admir presid    presid    and other who have made veri strong argument    i take note of one thing that is veri differ at this meet from what i have heard in my year plus at this tabl   this is the first  e that mani peopl have said   and i certain have heard this from the peopl i have talk to in the field   that they are move on price instead of be tamp down in term of their desir   in other word  they have price power  and it is be realiz   this is the first  e we   ve heard that in the discuss  and it worri me   it   s veri  veri import that we signal our anti inflationari resolv   i general alway agre with presid pool   i happen to be a minimalist as far as the statement is concern   but if we paus here  it is veri import that we use the kind of languag that governor kohn suggest and that we make it veri clear that this may not be the end of the process   even more import  mr  chairman  is that we agre at this tabl that we   ll be fearless in move if we have to       as to the market  i think presid   made a veri good comment   have been a market oper for thirti year of my career  i have found that market are usual wrong   our job is not to satisfi the market   our job is to get the economi right   that   s our mission   so i would accept a paus  mr  chairman  under the condit i just mention   i like governor kohn   s suggest on languag although  like a broken record  i would put the word    global    in front of    resourc util    becaus i think that reflect realiti   have said what i just said  i would also say that  if the group decid to rais the rate    basi point  i won   t dissent becaus i don   t have a vote    laughter
excel reason   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the incom data have heighten my concern about inflat   i think it   s true  as a number of peopl have mention around the tabl  that inflat expect have not move up   the market seem pretti confid that we   re go to be success in fight inflat   but as kevin   said  the market can be pretti fickl   we   re go to get some further bad news on inflat in the come month  and i hope the market will maintain their confid in the feder reserv   but their confid in us could chang as the news continu to be bad in the come month   also  i think we have to ask whether our failur for two year now to keep inflat insid what mani of us have said is our comfort zone     to   percent   is go to weigh eventu on the assess of the market and their confid in the feder reserv   i   m concern that the public   s confid in us may begin to waver if we don   t express our readi to tighten if inflat  sn   t head down soon   it   s not clear to me that we   ve put restrict enough financi condit in place to put inflat on much of a downward path   accord to the bluebook  the fed fund rate is close to neutral   in the bluebook   s longer run simul  the op um polici requir further     rate increas to put us on the path to     percent   we won   t get there just stay where we are now   i realiz it   s a veri close call  and everyon has mention that  but on balanc  i would prefer to rais rate    basi point at this meet   i won   t repeat all the comment that cathi     and   made   i think they were veri persuas   it would surpris the market  but we shouldn   t be do what the market expect us to do   we should be do  as someon said  what   s right for the economi and for the american peopl   it  sn   t appear that an increas will be the consensus come out of this meet   i   d just add that  if we do paus  it   s not go to be easi for us to start again   i don   t think we should kid ourselv about that   we   re go to be accus of whipsaw by the market  and we   ll take a lot of critic   so we   re go to have to take a veri tough stand if we decid to rais rate again   it   s not go to be easi  and we should just be prepar to do that   look ahead  i   d say that if we determin that factor are not reduc growth too much and if inflat   not appear to be moder  then we   re go to need to increas rate further to coax inflat back toward price stabil   we have to  make it clear in our public statement that we   re prepar to do that   if we do go with the paus  then i certain agre with don kohn   s recommend that we should use the languag from section   of altern c and move it to section   of altern b   to omit the refer to high level of resourc util  when we   ve had it in our past statement  would be a serious error
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   well  i   m like everybodi els around the tabl    i have found the decis about which way to go to be a veri tough call   i   m come down on  the side of a paus right now  part becaus i   m more pessimist than the staff forecast on the     second order effect of the slowdown in hous   we   re hear from some banker that subprim borrow especi are have more difficulti and that delinqu in that sector are go up   although i don   t see a prolong problem  as hous slow  the effect are go to bleed into other sector  and whether into home furnish or other thing  i think there will be wider implic   i also think the op  about the hous sector is so import to peopl becaus it   s a big chunk of their net worth   so i   m just not as posit about the outlook here   anoth concern i have is what is realli happen with the disrupt of oil suppli around the world   i think that situat is potenti more disrupt   we don   t put polit thing in our forecast   a good friend in the oil industri is veri concern  asid from the polit risk  about the oper risk in the industri right now  as i mention awhil ago   so i think there is enough uncertainti out there that i   m on the edg  and it   s that uncertainti that lead me to say     let   s take  e out and paus      i like governor kohn   s suggest for the chang in altern b   it   s import that we signal resourc util   it   s also import to signal that this is a paus and not a perman stop becaus  when you look at the futur curv  it   s as though the market figur that onc we stop we   re go to stop forev   it   s also import that we signal that we are paus to see  what the lag effect will be
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   from a capit market perspect  as i think about this decis  what matter more than the price of this issuanc   that is  the decis on    basi point   is realli what the after market effect are   how is this secur go to trade over the next week and month   when i think about the decis in that context  it put the     burden on the communic  which are onli in small part in the messag of our statement today   at the end of the day  i am will to agre to a paus   but  again  i think that put the  burden on lay the predic that we are in fact pois and prepar to act as necessari   that begin with our statement  but it  sn   t end there   given the data that are like to come in between this meet and the next  a coupl of cpis  a coupl of ppis  mayb a revis pce  and what   s like to happen to some of the forward look market indic  tip spread  some of the commod price   i think it is veri import that the market understand  befor the trade in the secur get veri signific  the depth of our think on the subject and of the discuss around this meet   the minut can be part of that communic   such communic is import so that they don   t perceiv us when we meet next to be react to one or two piec of data  the way they seem to have overreact to one or two piec of data last week  but realli  recogn the depth of our think on this subject   to be consist with that view  i think governor kohn   s suggest of indic a paus as power as we can is critic   the market  in the first day  are go to take our paus to be a stop  as reflect current in the eurodollar futur contract and the fed fund  futur contract   but we need to disabus them of that view as quick  as frequent  and as consist as we can so that the paus   not becom read as a stop   we will then have set out the condit for the way in which we might react if differ data aris   again  i think that the decis today is not an easi one   it   s import that the market recogn that it is unlik that our work here is done   with all that said  i   m prepar to support governor kohn   s suggest
thank you   governor
as i said befor  obvious this is an extrem difficult decis  and i agre with mani peopl around the tabl who have said that veri respect argument could be made on both side   so i would say that  on net  there are some advantag to keep polici unchang but communic veri  veri strong our wari about inflat   i think there is valu in paus to see what is go to happen with growth   around the tabl  we certain express differ view about what is happen to growth   we know that we   re like to continu get somewhat unfavor number on inflat  but i think the market are well prime for that   we   ve gotten some number that have been worrisom or unwelcom and not particular favor on inflat  but we haven   t seen inflat expect becom unanchor   also  we   ve been see that the market have appar been assum that we are not go to move now and that we   re not go to move in the futur  if you look to the fed fund futur market  but that assumpt hasn   t manifest itself in ani increas in the short term or longer term inflat prospect   that   s veri hearten to me   if that weren   t the case  i would not feel comfort in move toward support a paus becaus  as mani of us have discuss  the expect context and credibl are veri import   credibl is an easi thing to lose and a difficult thing to recaptur  but i don   t think have a paus now would lead us to lose credibl   i think also that it   s import that we see a paus as not be just until the next meet but as possibl go over multipl meet becaus a lot of inform  particular with respect to inflat  will come out over  e   i express my view that we may be see some transitori effect on inflat that are due primarili to shelter servic   within two or three meet we   ll have a better feel for whether or not those effect are like to be transitori  and i think keep our powder dri is veri valuabl       we   ve been emphas not just that we are data depend but that we are forecast depend   what do the data say about what is like to happen in the futur   say that we are forecast depend help to underscor that  even though the current data or the recent backward look data are not favor  we are look to the futur to what the evolut of inflat and growth is like to be   exact what the last line of altern b emphas   i think  one  it   s what we should be do and  two  it   s import for peopl to see that   so i would favor go with altern b or have the languag in altern c   i   m not sure the altern c languag add all that much more  given the fair strong statement that we have in the assess of risk  becaus i think that is like to lead to a somewhat chang expect fed fund futur curv   to leav some probabl that we may move and that this is not a stop  certain  if our paus is interpret as a stop  we need to pursu a communic strategi to convey that it is not a stop and that a paus   not mean just one meet but possibl multipl meet as we are gather more inform  particular about the transitori versus persist effect of inflat  and are keep a veri care eye on the effect of both short term and long run inflat expect
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   we could obvious justifi move today  but we don   t need to move today   we don   t need to move today  princip becaus we have an economi that has alreadi slow to what we think is trend and becaus we have inflat expect at the long horizon stay relat stabl despit advers inflat news and a fair amount of uncertainti about the path of inflat go forward  that has happen  as mani of you have said  in the context of substanti downward revis     of the expect termin fed fund rate   that   s a bit of an experi in credibl   we don   t want to take too much reassur from that  but it   s posit   i think we have to signal that inflat remain the predomin risk and that we may have more tighten to do   we have to make it clear that  if expect deterior or if our  forecast for inflat chang materi  we are prepar to tighten further   mani of the prism we look through to judg the appropri path of polici go forward suggest we may have more to do   they don   t tell us with ani certainti that we have a lot more to do  they suggest that we may have more to do   if you choos the     percent target for core pce and take out the inerti prefer in the op  polici rule  the case for go signific abov      on the fund rate is pretti strong   we need to look for the combin of action and messag in the statement that give us the most flexibl go forward   it   s hard to know with confid what that combin is  my own view is that  if we don   t move today but we have a strong statement about the asymmetri around the risk  we preserv the possibl of tighten further   if we move today and the world unfold as we expect  i think in some way it   s harder at the margin to tighten further   but none of us know that with total confid becaus we don   t know how the market is go to interpret the statement   credibl is a veri complic thing   if we look as though we   re move out of fear that we   ve lost it  you could say that might be more damag to percept about our credibl   you can think about the domin option on the tabl as a paus come from a posit of strength and confid and a move in these circumst come from a posit of greater tentat and weak   i don   t think that would be desir   it is someth we should tri to avoid       look at market expect today  i see three thing that make me uneasi   one is the high degre of confid that we   re pretti close to be done   the second is the invers    the speed with which they have us remov a bunch of polici tighten ahead   the third is the degre of certainti or confid in the path for interest rate   i don   t know whi they have that degre of confid and certainti   laughter  i don   t think we have it   it   s hard to know  howev  how to get us out of that mix   i think that  as sever of you have suggest  it would be nice if we made the market a littl less confid that we   re go to be take out the last move or two of tighten pretti quick   how to do that is difficult   altern b  as modifi by don kohn  come the closest to do so   i would also favor a second suggest  which is put back in the refer to ongo product gain  for the follow reason   we revis down our es  of structur product growth a bit  and that   s a materi chang in our view about product   but the basic forecast  as we best judg it  is still a pretti good one for product growth   we don   t want to look as though we   ve lost convict about that basic posit outlook for product growth   it omiss would be veri conspicu  and i don   t think we   ve learn enough to justifi the risk of creat the signal that we   ve lost confid that we   re go to have product grow in the vicin of            percent   for those reason  i   d favor put that back in   just to summar  i   m reason comfort not move today  but i think we should send a strong signal that the risk are still predomin to the upsid on inflat   i also think that altern b  as modifi by don    the best job of communic that messag
thank you veri much   first of all  i   d like to thank everyon for a realli help and thought discuss   it was veri use   let me just make a few comment       first  we do need to be care to think about what the op  polici look like   it  sn   t take the form that we keep rais rate until we   re happi with the inflat rate  instead  what we need to look for is the rate that  if maintain  will ul  give us a good trajectori in the economi   i would submit that we don   t realli know where that is yet   presid   made some veri interest argument about the real rate of interest in the late      s   those are good argument  but i would repli to him  first  that we   ve seen veri low real rate in the past decad  a global save glut and all of that  and  second  we have at the moment an is shock of veri signific and unknown size   the hous market  which is declin veri sharpli   so i agre that we may well want to go up from where we are   i think that   s  in fact  a more like outcom   but we realli can   t be sure at this point where we ul  want to stop  and we need to be a bit cautious and tri to learn about exact where that level is go to be   for those reason  i   m not comfort with altern a or c becaus they basic say that we   re done  either at      or       and so the choic then are between altern b and altern d   i   m concern with altern d becaus  besid rais the rate to       it signal further increas   after seventeen consecut move  we would be tighten into a hous declin   we don   t have that much confid that we need to be so strong at this point  signal a strong concern about inflat but be more cautious in grope for the op  level of the interest rate is probabl a wiser cours   i remind you that the fed has not been terribl success with soft land   we have a chanc to get one   all els be equal  i think it would be good if we could achiev that    so i   d recommend altern b   i   ll come back to the languag in just a moment   i character this as a hawkish paus   i think it has sever advantag   the first is to gather     inform   with respect to some of the point presid pool rais  i think the key inform we want to look at is  first  activ  we want to look at employ  hous  and consumpt  in particular  which will give us some indic about growth go forward  but we also want to look at inflat data and inflat expect data   inflat expect  specif  are mention in the statement  and an unteth of inflat expect would be  on it own  ground for us to respond   the risk of our fall behind the curv by paus is relat small   again  i think that we   re not more than a coupl of move away from the op  level   therefor  if we miss a meet or two and then move again in novemb or decemb  we will still be abl to reach this op  level within a reason period of  e  moreov  we have a degre of freedom on the other end  so to speak   if the market expect us to begin to cut  we can alway maintain the rate at the level for a longer period than expect to get some further restrict   so on the substanc i think there are ground  after seventeen move and with the hous market in an indetermin situat  to paus and to get more inform   i   d like to say a word about the tactic as well   presid   was correct that my introduct of the idea of a paus was not particular well receiv   but we have now  at least read the commentari  explain the differ between a paus and a stop   it   s use for us to get the flexibl that will allow us not necessarili to move at everi meet but to move as the data requir   a demonstr of that flexibl has some valu in term of creat some more option for us in the futur   also  we have been talk about data depend   by creat this flexibl  we   ll be abl to increas the relationship between what we do and what the data say  and i think that   s alreadi work   for exampl  i would note the wide dispers of view among the dealer about where we   re eventu go to stop   that dispers of view come from differ about where they think the economi and inflat are go   it is     veri encourag to me that they are now not look to us for forward guidanc but rather look at the state of the economi and tri to judg where the fed will have to go to achiev it object   so recogn the concern that have been rais and take them veri serious  i think that our best option  of perhap not veri mani great option  is a hawkish paus  which i associ with altern b   with respect to the languag  i think it is an improv to take at least the first sentenc of section   in altern c  which includ high resourc util  and use it in place of the first sentenc of section   in altern b   i have two question for the group   one  do we want to reintroduc or go back to our old languag of includ product gain   if so  that would requir the second sentenc of altern a  section     if not  we just use the whole section   of altern c   that   s question one   two  presid pool has express concern about the hous refer   we could simpli say    reflect the lag effect    and leav out the hous part   i would take suggest on that   i would note that we have use this hous  phrase in the past few meet  and so it would be a chang   presid
the unit labor cost figur suggest leav product gain out of this  that   s just my opinion
okay   other comment   presid
if we were to keep product gain in  i would suggest strike the word    ongo
may i say someth on the mention of hous
i think bill   s reserv about it are right   of cours  they would have appli the last  e we use it  too   i guess i would argu for keep  hous in on the ground that it   s happen   it is the princip area in which we see some weak go on in the economi  and not to make refer to that realiti seem a littl awkward   it would be like have a statement that didn   t mention what   s happen in either energi price or hous  and that would be hard to justifi   so i would keep it  on the simpl ground that it is happen and it   s an accur descript of realiti   i don   t think it   s a problem
section   can reason be interpret as refer to second quarter gdp   that   s the news that we have  and there has been a slow in a wide rang of sector   so i think that that   s a sensibl interpret   there are continu concern about hous go forward   i understand that   but it seem to me that section   is realli a statement about what has alreadi happen in the economi   that   s the essenti element of it   and hous is just not the biggest thing that has happen   i would also agre with   that we should keep product out becaus peopl logic say     well  unit labor cost are what are realli import here     and we don   t have a great stori to tell on unit labor cost
i think it would be odd to take out the refer to hous  given that we have mention it a number of  e in the past   the rational clear say that it   s    part reflect    and then give a number of factor   it is not say that those factor are the onli one   also  i don   t interpret this languag as be simpli about what happen in the past     has moder    is also talk about where we are   that growth is not as strong as it was   i see     that languag as have a forward look aspect to it   i think it would be veri odd to take hous out  part becaus it   s factual accur  even if you take the histor view  and part becaus  given our discuss around the tabl  we are concern about    gradual cool      it is  appropri to leav the refer in
i agre with randi on this   it would be veri strang to take hous out now becaus it was in last  e and becaus it is so import to the futur of the economi  the product question is a close call   on balanc  i   d leav it out becaus it   rais the whole question about unit labor cost
ani other view   presid
i   m new to these languag nuanc about hous   it occur to me  howev  that one question you ought to ask is whether by includ hous or continu to includ hous the committe is put itself in a posit where it can   t rais rate until hous come back   are we unfair lock ourselv in  or at least are the market go to interpret it that way   that   s just anoth question to think about in decid how to includ it
i think that presid   has a good point there and presid pool did as well   section   is aim at explain what has happen with growth in the past  everyth moder   to me  the most surpris thing was how slow busi fix invest was   it was not so surpris that hous was slow becaus we expect hous to be slow  so i think you could easili take hous out of there   you have the lag effect of increas in interest rate  which affect hous as well as a whole rang of other thing   i also think that   has a good point   we don   t want to hang our action on one piec of data      versus anoth piec of data go forward   i   m agnost about product  to tell you the truth  i think the unit labor cost number are not good news   we have some problem there   and to  hang it out as a save factor again and again may not be what we want to do
all right   i think we need to come to resolut   oh  sorri  governor bie
i would prefer to leav hous in becaus hous resourc aren   t readili substitut for other part of the economi   if we leav resourc util in  we   re sort of acknowledg that  although hous is soft  there are still resourc pressur in other part of the economi   i think the pictur is better balanc that way
okay   thank you   let me just say that i think this languag is pure descript   i don   t think it   s condit our action on anyth have to do with hous   i don   t think the market will tie our move to hous   let   s just take a straw vote   how mani would like to keep the statement as it is with hous includ   one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven   okay   i think that   s a major   so we   ll leav section   as it is   is there ani sen ent for go back to altern a  section    second  sentenc  which includ ongo product gain   are ani of you in favor of that   laughter   all right   the statement  then  will be exact altern b  except that the third section of altern c will be substitut for the third section of altern b   would you pleas call the roll
yes   the direct would be     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek     condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent      then the risk assess is     nonetheless  the committe judg that some inflat risk remain   the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need to address these risk will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth as impli by incom inform     chairman bernank yes vice chairman          yes governor bie yes yes presid guynn yes governor kohn yes governor   presid   no yes presid pianalto yes governor   presid   yes
thank you veri much   we have a lunch break now for   about half an hour  and then we   ll reconven to discuss communic   lunch break
i know some peopl have flight and so on  so whi don   t we continu eat here   if you   re still eat  we can just reconven   befor we get go  i just want to recogn barbara driggin over here   barbara is retir    applaus   thank you  barbara  for thirti six year of servic  and we hope this display of affect will caus you to reconsid    laughter

best of luck   our afternoon session is on communic  i   d like to turn it over to governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   we are in a hurri  and i don   t have anyth realli in the way of introduct   i just want to say that we sent a list of question  but we didn   t expect answer to everi question  we hope that the question help to spark think about some of the broad issu relat to communic   what we   re tri to do and the broad strategi of how we should go about it   i remind you that  as the memo say  this is an initi discuss    e is limit  so we   d prefer not to get into the detail of various propos but to think about broad issu of strategi and goal
okay   we   re just go to have a go round   pleas rais your hand  and   will take your name
if no one want to start   laughter  i can start   i actual have just a coupl of thing to say   we need to keep in mind that communic is not an end in and of itself   it   s a mean to an end   where we rank on some professor   s tabl of transpar isn   t realli what it   s about   it   s about meet our legisl object for stabl price and maximum employ   as we think about our communic  we ought to concentr on that   what our goal and object are and where inflat and activ are go relat to those object  given the shock and dynam of the economi  and the broad polici outlin for strategi to fo  those object   if we do that well  we   ll help achiev those object  both by build public understand of  confid in  and support for a polit independ central bank and by give privat agent  in financi market and in labor and product market  inform that should help them act in way that will promot achiev our goal   i think we   ve done a good job of this   certain  this institut for the past twenti five year has been pretti darn success at achiev our congression mandat  and our communic has contribut to that   at least around the edg it certain has help  in both     the polit and the econom dimens   so i don   t think we have a communic strategi that   s serious broken  that need radic surgeri   but i do think it has grown in an ad hoc way  separ in each area of communic   the announc and the minut  for exampl  this is a good  e to step back and see how thing are fit togeth   whether we can tailor some thing to some audienc and other thing to other audienc that we want to attract and whether anyth is miss from the strategi   the discuss this morn reinforc my view that we do need to talk about goal and about whether we should be numer defin price stabil   there   s a presumpt around the tabl that we have alreadi done this to a certain extent  but we haven   t as a committe  we   re in a kind of unten posit right now in which the outsid world  sn   t know how  we look at our object and how we would act   so we need to have that discuss  and i   m glad that we   ve schedul it for the first part of the discuss in octob   how the economi is do relat to our goal  object  and strategi   requir forward look languag   we tri to indic in this memo that the forward look languag has pitfal that we need to keep in mind as we go forward   what we know is limit   that certain was a theme this morn about our uncertainti  and convey that uncertainti is realli  realli hard   how we indic the risk  which are almost as import as the central tendenc forecast  is someth we   re go to need to work on   there are issu about the market   s put too much weight on what we say   i was surpris  mr  chairman  by the reaction to your tes oni and how much emphasi they seem to put on our project  indic where they thought thing would be go forward   in retrospect  i wonder whether there are way of indic our degre of uncertainti around those     project  and i think we need to honor and encourag the divers and exchang of view in the committe   all those issu are hard with respect to the outlook for inflat and econom activ   and they are even harder with respect to the outlook for interest rate and our polici path in particular   the issu of condit  overweight  and flexibl becom even more acut when we start talk about our own polici path   there are  e  and the summer of      was one of those  in which the market   s interpret of where our polici path might be has the potenti for imped our abil to meet our object   in      and the subsequ year or two year  i think we were right to put some emphasi on that becaus  if we hadn   t  it would have been harder to meet our goal   but for the most part  i think the market should be abl to infer what we   re go to do from how we talk about our goal and our assess of the econom develop  and we don   t need to discuss the immedi outlook for polici   it would be nice to think about way of get away from this busi of signal what we   re go to do exact at the next meet  part becaus we don   t know but also becaus it   some  build in expect that affect our decis and dynam   those are some broad thought i had
oh  dear   so you didn   t want answer to all of these question   this homework assign was signific    laughter   i agre with a lot of what governor kohn has said   in my view  anyway  the princip goal behind central bank    communic what they   re do and whi is that they need to be account for their action in a democrat societi   i see that as the primari goal of all form of central bank communic   that is  the preserv of the legi aci of the central bank   we   re not elect offici   we   re appoint     offici   we   re do someth that   s critic as far as the economi   s perform is concern  and we need to be account for it   a secondari goal is to facilit the transmiss of monetari polici by better shape the market   s understand of what we   ve done so that their action can help the direct of polici  but in that regard  in term of the market   s facilit the direct of polici  what we do realli ought to be more import   and i think don was say this   than what we say about what we   ve done   communic can help  but it can also hinder short term market percept   over the longer run  what we actual do will creat or destroy our credibl   we also need   and i think this is consist with what don was say   to think about constraint   i would be veri concern if we end up tri to convey the futur cours of polici with certainti except in veri unusu circumst  like those that began in mid        in that regard  i took a measur of confid in some of the chairman   s discuss in the polici round with regard to be encourag that major market particip weren   t unanim in what they thought we were go to do  that there was a rang of thought out there   i think we can learn from that   if we forc everyon to have a certain view about what we   re do and then they just feed back to us what we   ve told them  we   re lose a lot in term of understand what   s go on in the market   about some of the other question here  i   ll just tri to hit the highlight   on quantiti    we ought to think not about how much we communic or how mani instrument we have or how differ they are but about their effect   it seem to me that we ought to tri to convey the uncertainti in the polici process in the most flexibl and expans of our communic instrument   our minut  the semiannu report  the chairman   s tes oni  and the speech that we give   the least flexibl and least expans form of communic  in     particular the statement  ought to be use to convey less subtl inform   thus  as i   ve often said in the past   and i think presid pool   s recommend have been in the same  direct   we ought to focus more in our meet statement on what we did and whi and leav the longer  more nuanc discuss to the minut or the semiannu report   if i had had a vote at this meet  i wouldn   t have dissent on the paus  and i was in favor of altern b with the enhanc section to make it more hawkish   but when you step back and you think about a hawkish paus  you wonder whether you   re ask your statement to do a lot of work for you  particular if you think you   re go to have to fill in exact what you meant by that statement in subsequ communic over the follow week   so i think some of that is a littl tough   on content   i don   t want to get into inflat target   yes  we have to talk about it  and we   ll get into that later in the year  i suppos   on forward look inform   that goe  back to uncertainti   i would not like to get into the process  like some central bank  of give a futur polici path   there are way of facilit the market   s understand of what our forecast are and where we see the risk   mayb we can do a better or more complet job with our semiannu inform  but i wouldn   t like to get into communic a polici path   final  on the subject of individu versus a committe   i don   t think the committe should constrain individu   that   s what the committe process is about   that we ought to feel free to express our opinion here as well as outsid the committe   howev  i also think that  at  e  circumst are such that a number of us are speak around the same  e  which creat the impress of commit the committe   i would want all of us to think hard and long about how we shape our public statement   even though we all are veri care about not commit the committe by say that these are our view and not the committe   s view      there are lot of way of say thing within our various statement that can act more or less to  bind our hand go forward  and i   d like us all to be sensit to that
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   don  i appreci the outlin that you gave in term of rais the question   i   ll be straightforward   as far as goal   what we are do and whi is the import part of communic   that   s our oblig   that is part of transpar  and it serv us well   regard our view of the futur   i think we should outlin that in term of the balanc of risk   what we   re do now is just about right  frank   we need to get away  from the idea of tri to signal or give a polici path   i think that get us into some difficulti   in addit  it bind committe member who may not agre into the futur  and that   s a disadvantag to the committe in the long run   have said that  i still think what we   re do right now is pretti darn good   have the statement to say here   s what we did and whi and the minut to show the nuanc of the view give further inform to the market and serv us well   speech may some  rais the media   s attent  but i think they have serv us well  i don   t think that we   ve gotten ourselv into too mani problem with them   onc we get through the discuss in octob in term of the price goal and that sort of thing  how we communic may chang   so we may need to have anoth discuss of this   but for the moment  with those comment  i   m pretti satisfi  with where we are
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll comment on just three area  in the spirit of be general here   first  on the goal   i thought the goal that you put into the document you distribut were veri good   they were veri well state and had an appropri     balanc   i didn   t think that they constrain open discuss at the meet   the communic of uncertainti and condit is difficult  but part of our goal should be to do it better   second  on the quantiti of inform and the forward look content   that whole seri of question that you ask   i   d divid my comment into two part   one  if we do go with some type of quantit guidelin  we will need to releas more inform   we   d need someth like an inflat report  mayb quarter  such as other central bank have  just to explain and elabor on the guidelin and how the economi was do versus that quantit guidelin   i don   t think we could just stay with the twice a year report that we give now in detail   third  we should talk about longer term forecast than we do now   that   s an import part of this   in fact  if this committe decid not to go with quantit guidelin  we could  accomplish mani of the object by just have longer term forecast for the economi   if we did these longer term forecast  we   d have to address mani of the issu that are discuss in the section here   the polici assumpt question  for exampl   we now do that base on  appropri polici  but we could do that in differ way   but the longer forecast would allow us to convey polici goal  to discuss expect path to achiev those goal  and to take into account the rang of opinion regard the path and goal without necessarili have us agre to a quantit guidelin   at this point  i   m agnost on the question of whether we should have a quantit guidelin   i should say that i realli haven   t decid yet and that the topic is for further discuss   in ani case  longer term forecast would be one option to consid if we did not go with a quantit guidelin   of cours  if we did go with a quantit guidelin  we could also have longer term forecast   but i think the longer term forecast would help us improv our formul of monetari polici  either with or without a quantit guidelin       i want to mention just one other point about the polici condit   i hope someon could do research on the bank of england approach   don  i know you   ve been there   they present a forecast condit on the market expect for polici interest rate   they also do an altern base on an unchang rate path   they   ve given us an exampl of one case in which the forecast base on the market show that inflat would be outsid the guidelin when they publish it  and the market immedi revers it view as to what the bank of england was abl to do on polici without the bank   s say anyth   just the public of that forecast itself accomplish a lot of their object   of cours  we   d have to be explicit about the technic detail under the market expect of the forecast  but that   s sort of a technic part of this     we   re off to a good start  and i particular like the goal that you set forth
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me make just a few comment   i  too  like the goal   to me  the overarch object of our communic polici should be to enhanc the effect of monetari polici   the goal that have been identifi in this latest paper    which i take to mean make sure that  insofar as possibl  we build public support for our polici and we work toward anchor expect   both work in that direct   it   s veri  import that the public broad defin understand what we   re do and whi   one implic of that thought is that we don   t want to make the statement too ters  now  i agre that they are supplement by the minut  tes oni  speech  and so on and so forth  but mani peopl are wed to the      p m  announc and the interpret of that announc  both immedi in the afternoon on cnbc and so forth and the next morn in the newspap   if we make the statement too ters  we   re go to leav peopl sit around     say     well  we know what they did  but we don   t have much of an understand of whi  how they view the world  where they think the risk lie     et cetera   so i would be care about work realli hard to shorten the statement   one place we   ve had a lot of success  in my opinion  is in articul our price stabil goal  whi that   s the appropri goal  and how it relat to the dual mandat   we   ve had more success than i would have predict  quit honest  when we start to articul that more forc a good number of year ago   there might be someth to be learn from that approach becaus i think we have been pretti consist about that messag and even some of it nuanc   we are go to get to the question about a numer object for inflat   when we do  we   re go to have to think long and hard   i suspect this  sn   t come as ani surpris to anybodi   about how that is go to play out in policyset  in decisionmak   we may need to provid some sort of background paper to the public at larg if we adopt it   in other word  here is what we   re do  here   s what we think the implic are  here   s how it   s go to play out in a polici role  as best we can see it   that   s just someth to think about for the futur   i think i   ll stop there
thank you  mr  chairman   i think this committe has made huge stride over the past decad toward greater transpar and more effect communic  an exampl be that   it was in       i guess   we actual start issu post meet statement   i think we   ve seen signific dividend from those innov   they have advanc the goal of both polici effect and account   our communic strategi at this point  in my view  is     not fundament broken  and so i hope that what we can accomplish in the come month is to produc some improv in current practic without go for wholesal chang   i thought today i would just touch on a coupl of point that i   ve been think about relat to communic  without get into specif   frank  i think the goal are fair noncontroversi   i regard them as pretti much motherhood and appl pie issu   what   s challeng is figur out exact how to use communic better both intern in the committe and extern to serv our polici goal   a coupl of cautionari note   first  i want to endors the point that don made that we should not put in our list of goal that our object is to maxim transpar for the sake of greater transpar   the research in this area provid veri ambigu advic about how much transpar is op    second  we need to be care that our communic don   t actual imped the process of make appropri polici decis or our abil to do so   in contrast to some of you  i have general favor the inclus of forward look languag in post meet statement  at least when the committe has a reason clear idea of where polici is go  as it has until quit recent   but includ such guidanc   have the potenti for build fals expect that can constrain our action   i hope that we will continu to provid forward look guidanc to the public becaus i think it   enhanc the effect of our polici action   but i think we will need to be veri clear that those kind of polici pronounc are not uncondit commit to futur action  and we need to continu to emphas data depend   i want also to emphas a point that cathi made  which is that communic is a two way street by which we communic with market and the public but we also receiv feedback from market and the public concern econom condit and expect     concern the futur   we benefit from that feedback perhap as much as or more than the public benefit from the utter that we make   that is a kind of independ realiti check on our forecast and analysi   therefor  we have to be care to ensur that these outsid voic aren   t drown out by peopl who parrot back what we say   there are  e when i have veri much worri that our communic have turn the market into a mirror in which we see littl more than our own reflect   now i   d like to spend just a coupl of minut on what to me is the most critic challeng that we face as we go forward with our communic strategi   it relat to the appar dichotomi between speak with one voic and speak as nineteen individu   the question is how to provid the public with the clearest and most coher descript of our collect goal  strategi  and polici while continu to promot an environ in which divers opinion among the nineteen fomc particip are not onli toler but encourag  in the past we have manag this balanc act in differ way depend on the circumst  and we   re go to need that kind of flexibl as we go forward   on the one hand  there are set in which the committe provid a reason unifi view to the public  that occur in our post meet statement and also in the chairman   s tes oni to the congress  on the other hand  we have a number of outlet for the express of member    divers view    the fomc meet minut  particip    speech  and the rang of fomc forecast that are publish in the monetari polici report   i think that type of approach  of have some unifi statement and mani opportun for express of divers opinion  is use   first  it give the public a reason accur sens of both the area of consensus in the fomc and the rang of opinion   second  take an    agre to disagre    approach lessen the likelihood that the fomc will becom trap in a kind of group think mental  in which we end up conform     for conform   s sake   of cours  with the freedom to disagre  we do have a respons  when we make statement  to be care that those statement are not interpret as repres  the view of the committe as a whole   final  an approach that tri to limit the rang of issu on which a committe as big as our attempt to speak with a unit voic will end up  enhanc the sens of collegi and cooper in the committe   the post meet statement provid a concret exampl of the t i balanc act that we confront   we all know it   s often easier to agre on a decis concern the feder fund rate than it is to agre in everi detail about whi we came to that decis  let alon about what we expect go forward   it   s impract for the statement to convey the full rang of our opinion and to attempt to give veri detail explan of the committe   s think   again  it tend to ignit disagr about which specif to includ or to exclud and about even the precis phrase of each and everi line   so in think about that  i find myself wonder if a better approach might be to recogn the intrins limit of the statement and to focus on communic onli necessari element that clear lie within the consensus view  leav fuller discuss to the minut and other thing   the same issu about uniti versus divers is go to aris when we come to discuss our longer term inflat object   i do great favor increas clariti concern the committe   s long term inflat object  but frank i   m uncertain which approach is go to  be the most attract to accomplish that   there is a rang of possibl   one possibl is that the committe could provid that type of inform through the public of the rang and  central tendenc of particip    longer term inflat project  which presum reflect ul  their inflat object   anoth possibl is that the committe could tri to agre on the specif numer object to communic to the public  assum that a suffici     consensus   exist in the committe   certain  the benefit of the latter approach would be a clearer signal to the public  which would be benefici   but the tradeoff here is that we have to be care not to straitjacket particip into a particular view that they don   t fulli endors   so as we go forward  i think we   re go to have to approach these issu case by case   in general  as i think about the question of uniti versus divers in our communic  i am move to the conclus that it   s probabl better to err on the side of preserv the advantag of the divers of view at the cost of somewhat less of the clariti and coher that would come if we could provid a unifi voic to the public
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the first set of question from the  subcommitte had to do with goal and principl   the first principl i   d bring to this is that money is intrins worthless and has valu onli becaus peopl expect it to have valu in the futur   so  to be a littl provoc  i   ll say that monetari polici is about peopl   s expect  and everyth els is just commentari   therefor  i fulli support the first goal   help peopl form expect regard our futur polici action is a reason goal for communic polici   the second goal seem clear  too   ensur account to the peopl who have grant us this monopoli on polici action   it   s import to be clear about what   s meant by communic regard futur polici action   it may mean say someth about the futur path of interest rate   and we   ve done that sever  e   but it  sn   t have to   an altern approach is to articul what object will determin our interest rate choic in the futur  and in principl  someon who understand our object and the constraint we   re under will be abl to figur out what we   ll  choos in ani given circumst   i think this offer realli good prospect for overcom some     of the problem that the committe has encount with the forward look guidanc languag  when we essenti tell the public what interest rate set we think will like be requir to achiev our object   it seem as though communic that would be enhanc by tell them what our object are   in a sens  that would aid effici   the subcommitte ask what constraint affect our communic   the obvious one that come to mind is  e consist   essenti  the idea that our claim about our futur  action are credibl   peopl have to think that our futur selv  be they us or our successor  will actual want to follow through on the action that we   ve impli by our communic    we are select what our futur selv are go to select   the question of whether our  communic will constrain our futur selv immedi aris   now  one can make some stark assumpt about this question   in the literatur  you typic see just two polar case analyz   one is    yes  total      the perfect commit case  the other is    no  not at all      the complet discret case   but for the purpos of our discuss  i think it make sens to adopt the intermedi view that our futur selv are like to view it as cost to be perceiv as  take action that contradict what we had previous communic   so i   m happi to assum that our statement are not cheap talk  to use game theori languag   at the same  e  i don   t think the credibl of our communic is perfect or costless   at all junctur we need to think through whether we will want to follow through on what we   re impli by our communic   that idea is relat to a separ issu that often aris in discuss of inflat target and communic  and that is whether communic will reduc our futur flexibl   at this point  let me just say that to stabil the valu of money we have alreadi sacrif a great deal of flexibl   i   d claim that we   ve given up the flexibl to inflat or     deflat at    percent in ani given year  in the near futur   we   ve given up a lot of thing to convinc peopl that money should have about the valu it has now   so it realli isn   t a question of give up flexibl  it   s a question of what flexibl we want to give up   here i   d make anoth point as well   if communic is go to have ani valu at all  it   s go to persuad some peopl to chang their mind about what action we would take in the futur   well  if that   s true  then in some sens it has to involv our give up some of the flexibl that the public has perceiv us to have   so while there are flexibl we would like to preserv  there are flexibl we   d like to give up   i don   t think flexibl per se is a trump card in this  situat   the subcommitte ask about what inform should be communic   i   ll just focus  on one thing that i talk about earlier today  and that   s our long run inflat object   let me be precis about what i mean here   averag across all possibl futur  take into account how we are expect to react in each possibl futur  what is the inflat rate n period from  now   it may not be perfect certain  but what is the averag across all of those futur  take into account how we   re go to react   let me defin that averag as long run expect inflat  at least the long run expect inflat associ with the public   s belief about our reaction that are built into that thought experi i just describ   in most of the standard model  except for those in which some learn about the policymak is occur    model with taylor rule or some other fix reaction function plop in   if you take n out long enough  like five year or so  long run expect inflat is a singl number that never vari   as i mention earlier this year  i don   t think that   s the world we live in now   person  i think that we ought to tri to agre on a valu for where we want inflat to be on averag and communic it to the public   i don   t see the benefit in term of short run flexibl of let     expect inflat n year ahead have a big  wide  and dispers probabl distribut around it or have the mean of that distribut fluctuat a lot   i can see the valu of be flexibl about how fast   a coupl of year or a coupl of quarter   we return inflat to target or about how far from target we let it drift  but i just don   t see the valu of allow fluctuat in our inflat  object year out   whenev i encount one of those softwar program for calcul your retir incom and they ask for a lot of assumpt   such as your age  your salari  your age at retir  and how fast your wage will go up  and all   and they get to a box where they ask what the inflat rate is go to be  i think to myself  i don   t know what to put in there   laughter   and i think   that   s exact right   i know what i   d like to put in there  but at this point that   s just wish think on my part  and i   m hesit to do that   i   m certain not go  to do that for my brother in law when he ask    laughter   i think it   s a real tragedi that we don   t have anyth to tell the countri for circumst like that   it   s the one thing that we ought to be abl to pin down in the long run  it   s the one thing we know we can deliv   we can   t deliv a predict averag real growth rate  we know we can   t deliv a predict averag unemploy rate  but we all agre we have a fair amount of latitud about the long run inflat forecast   anyway  that   s what i have to say about this subject

mr  chairman  sinc i   m not go to be here in octob  i probabl should sit quiet  but i can   t resist   i think almost everyth has been said   i want just to comment quick on a coupl of thing   i   m not sure we realli talk about a veri fundament     question   that is  who it is we are tri to communic with   that deserv a bit of discuss  it seem to me   build on the whole notion of tri to quantifi our object  i think we   ve seen what a box we can get ourselv in   in the absenc of someth  we all start offer our own quantit whatev   at the current  e  we   re in a posit in which mani of us have specifi what we think our comfort zone is   we haven   t explain how we   re go to measur it  we haven   t reconcil the differ across peopl  we haven   t explain what we   re go to do when we   re not there  so we   ve gotten ourselv in this kind of halfway hous   whether we   d like to talk about inflat target and all the thing that go with it or not  we   re go to have to stop and deal with it   we haven   t realli talk veri much about the role of the forecast   and i hope policymak has alway been base on forecast   but we have been much more explicit about that role in recent  e   that open up the whole question of whose forecast and how we talk about forecast at all the differ stage   final   and i can   t resist comment   i think the greatest short term tension regard the issu of what to do with the four paragraph post meet statement and what to do with the minut   i   ve more and more come to the view of bill pool that less is more   we simpli can   t get veri much of the differ way of think into that four paragraph statement   i think that   s an imposs task   we all think about it veri differ   we   ve heard it today   the statement is simplist   i would hope when you get around to talk about the issu that it would be clear that the minut offer a much better way of tri to help peopl understand not onli the uncertainti but the rang of view that go with the policymak and not let that littl simplist statement after a meet becom the most import communic   end of stori   thank you
thank you   presid pool
let me concentr on the forward look inform on the feder fund  path or someth associ with it   one of the problem i have with     s posit is that  everi  e we put that inform in  we need to have an exit strategi of how we   re go to get it out   as soon as you stop put it in  you get yourself tangl up   in fact  i think that   s where we are today and one of the reason that we have the languag in the statement that we do today   i would  put it in onli under veri special circumst with a clear understand of the strategi of how to get it out   the argument of this whole bias tilt languag goe back to volcker  i believ  it was use as a devic to tri to produc more agreement within the committe   then it was continu under  span   it wasn   t announc to the public   so the idea was that you would get some peopl to go along with what the chairman want by say that we   ll have a tilt toward x or y  up or down  it was meant to produc a larger vote for the consensus   onc we start to announc it public  it start to affect the market   i was part of that decis   i was in favor of it at the  e  and i have sinc had veri strong second thought about it   in part becaus of the experi of tri to get out from under it onc we start down that road   we need to put more thought into explain in our statement the decis that was reach  which we don   t do veri much of realli   we don   t put much text around the reason for the decis  compar with the risk or the foreshadow of what we might do in the futur   so that   s where i  would put my effort in draft the statement

thank you  mr  chairman   i agre that the goal list in the  subcommitte   s memo are the right goal   howev  in think about the next few question     concern the quantiti and the content of the inform and the natur of ani forward look  inform that we provid  i find it difficult to make judgment without know where we   re  go to emerg from our discuss about what polici approach we take  especi the discuss about whether we   re go to adopt a numer inflat object   as other have said  i think that  our communic practic need to reinforc our polici strategi   in fact  we should consid our communic practic to be a part of our polici strategi   so  for exampl  if we move down the path of adopt a numer object for inflat  then the appropri communic strategi may simpli be to provid the explicit inflat object with littl guidanc about specif polici move beyond refer to our perform  against that object   in that case  i think there would be less need for inform in the statement that follow our meet   howev  it might requir more inform in our semiannu report to  the congress   then regard the forward look languag  again i think it depend on whether or not we adopt a numer object for inflat   a success communic strategi should first and foremost give the public confid that we   re go to produc low inflat over the long run   i don   t think that a good communic polici strategi  as other have alreadi said  necessarili  mean that we have to make sure the public can anticip our next polici move   if we have a  numer object help us to anchor long term inflat expect  then that forward look guidanc might be reserv for those  e when the committe has a great deal of certainti in the  cours of it near term polici move or when it perceiv that the cost of be misunderstood is just except great     regard the last set of question from the subcommitte involv the individu communic or the committe communic  i believ that whatev communic     strategi we adopt  it is import to preserv our abil to give and express independ view  especi about forecast  polici strategi  action  and so forth   it   s clear that each of us formul our own independ opinion about polici action  and we form those opinion from a sens of how we think econom condit will evolv   i   d like to preserv the abil that we enjoy today of share our independ think and the climat that i sens we have today of a committe that   s veri skill at build consensus around differ perspect but yet see the benefit of respect dissent   thank you
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  we do have respons for a fiat currenc  and my straightforward and undiplomat way of describ what we do for a live is that we are perform a great confid game   i think that   s import to bear in mind   as presid    said  this is appl pie and motherhood   the answer is    yes    to the first question  but there are question about which agent we are talk about and  when we talk about generat well inform expect  how we do so   i mention earlier  to governor kohn   s embarrass     full frontal exposur     and i think  that   s not an unimport point   to maintain the confid game that we have to maintain and   if you   ll permit me to say this have experienc the other side   to maintain the last bastion of  integr in washington   and i feel veri strong about that   we have to be veri care that we  preserv a bit of modesti and my i to accomplish our goal   the realli tough part is how far we  go  and that   s what we   re go to have to talk about go down the path   for exampl  i   m  somewhat uncomfort  even though i have great respect for presid    about make  long term forecast   the further out you forecast  the more probabl error is   i am wari of     expos our vulner  and i think we should be mind of that as we go through  e   that   s just one thought   anoth thought is about the statement   i may have forgotten my logic here  but i think we  should be as straight as occam   s razor   that is  we should take as few variabl as possibl to explain what we decid to do   i do think the minut are veri import for illumin   i don   t want to manipul the minut  but i think we can use them quit effect   in my statement  earlier in the meet  when we were discuss our view of the economi  i said that i think we did that veri effect the last  e around   then a third point   i   m a strong believ in partnership   i mention this at a dinner with the presid last night   i   m also a veri strong believ in a strong manag partner model  have work all my life in the privat sector in partnership   but i do think it   s veri  veri  import to have a divers of view  and so i second what has been said at the tabl on that front as well   those are my three comment  mr  chairman
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support the broad goal that are laid out here    in think about communic  i see that one challeng we will have relat to some of the dialogu we had today   we set some long term goal   how do we link those to what we do in individu meet action and decis   we alreadi talk about how inflat has been abov our   percent top goal for two year  and it is like to be so for two year more   how would we explain that when we were tri to go forward   this is the sort of problem that corpor have  everi year  when they set goal for sharehold return  but then the earn jump around like    crazi quarter to quarter   well  we   re go to have the same kind of issu   it rais the question of   whether we want to talk about how we   re go to get from one place to anoth   in other word  a     compani can say that they took these big chargeoff  but that will reduc the cost base  or that they are make an acquisit   we need to have some real dialogu about what a set goal is go to  mean for our short run communic after each meet and for the polici path   it   s the differ between set the goal and implement and execut it effect   if we can   t  communic how we intend to implement effect  then we ought to have second thought about the goal that we   re set   sinc i   ve been here we realli haven   t talk a lot about how to tie those two togeth   on the forward look inform   it might have been appropri back when we start this    basi point step up each meet   i   m glad we   re now take the posit that we   re tri to push the risk back to the market   the market has to make it own forecast of what   s like to happen   we need to be clear as to what the key driver are and pick the few vital element that we  realli all can agre on   we need to communic that well but make the market judg where those  variabl are like to go in the outlook   i don   t think we do a servic to ourselv or to the market  if they feel they can sit back and let us make the call   the moral hazard and other issu there are simpli too great
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   just a few brief comment   first  with respect to the concis of our statement and the minut  i guess in a perfect world the minut would come out much sooner after our statement  but i recogn all the work that need to get done to get consensus and understand on those   i have a modest suggest  which we can take back up in octob   the minut could end up be releas somewhat sooner but also be more corpor in natur   it strike me that a lot of the communic that we do through the minut is use for histori and for an understand of     mani of the nuanc that we   ve talk about but is probabl not that use for some of the other communic purpos discuss here   it would certain be use if the crucial argument in the discuss we had today were avail in the minut befor three week have elaps   that would take some of the burden off figur out what goe into the statement   without burden the staff by get the same product done sooner  we could think rather about what should be part of a   corpor style set of minut   we   ve taught the market that a full set of the minut would come  out  but my own suggest is that the full set could be somewhat delay   that   s just a sort of provoc suggest without as much discuss and thought as we   d want  but i think it part address the statement issu   second  on strike the right balanc between individu and the committe  i   m more  convinc than ever  now that i have gone through four fomc meet  that the divers view that  peopl express on monetari polici outsid this meet are import and are critic independ   what i   m go to say is not an attempt to break that diverg of view or dissuad peopl from share them   i think it   s actual more problemat when fomc particip say similar thing between meet   for exampl  mr  chairman  let   s say that you said x and that    of us went out and repeat x more or less ident after the meet   the market understand of that is no longer x or  x but perhap   x or   x  and i think that   prove problemat   a burden should be on each of us  when we take our messag to differ place between meet  to be think about the consequ  in particular  when we   re say similar thing   none of that mean to say that if you believ y instead of x you should not be abl to go scream that from the hill  but if you  believ a nuanc of x  you realli have to consid how the market are go to understand the repetit that they   ve heard       third  just a brief point about market disciplin   i think presid   and presid    made refer to this   we   ve been fair cogniz over the past sever meet about get the market to do their own work and not to reli on us   that market disciplin is veri import   governor kohn said at the outset that the purpos of this discuss is not to have  transpar for transpar   s sake but to tri to get to the right monetari polici object   it  strike me as though we could well test the limit of transpar by share too much inform and get the market in a posit where they stop do much of the homework we   ve onli  start get them to do at this point   the right place to come to that judgment is somewher  around where that transpar end up make them more lem than we   d ideal like   i must  admit that i   m not exact sure how to pull that off  but it strike me that   s the way to structur or to think about that discuss   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the goal are pretti clear state  and i have no real problem with them   i agre that communic and transpar are realli a key part of maintain and enhanc our own credibl   i also understand  as i listen to peopl around the  tabl and other convers  that some of these issu have no easi or clear answer to them  and i should note in advanc that my own view are evolv as i think about and understand the nuanc of the issu   i agre with presid     i   d like to applaud the committe becaus in the past ten year there have realli been great stride in both transpar and communic    part of the challeng  it seem to me  is how we meet these goal   i think it   s true that put some limit on what inform is releas is probabl necessari over certain period of    e   for exampl  i wouldn   t advoc open the fomc meet to the public  i think that would not be terribl use   on the other hand  governor   was just talk about perhap     releas minut earlier or fa  or some version of them  mayb with incomplet detail  but   includ the tone and natur of the discuss   i think it could be fair use and inform  particular if it note disagr or discuss in term of where the tension happen to be within the meet   i spent sever month at the bank of england a coupl of year ago and watch the give and take among committe member at the mpc and also watch them go out in  public and discuss their differ view and whi they disagre with each other   that was veri instruct to me becaus they did it without appar ad to volatil in the marketplac   the market had come to accept the notion that these peopl disagre on some thing   the inform releas might differ depend on the type of monetari regim we think   we   re in   whether in a regim of inflat target or one of full discret   howev  regardless of the regim  the need for policymak to clear communic what their goal are  their understand of the economi   s current econom condit and expect futur condit  and  then the reason for their decis is an import part of communic   as to the quantiti of inform  quantiti and qualiti to me are intertwin  so i   m go to talk about both of them togeth   again  i applaud the expedit releas of the minut   institut that was a tremend step forward  and i think it   s a veri good idea   howev  i would favor the  committe   s releas some addit piec of inform   i obvious favor state an explicit definit of price stabil becaus do so would help clarifi our goal   the current practic of cite the rang and central tendenc of member    forecast is fine  but i would favor our releas more inform  perhap in a quarter forecast or in someth like an inflat report  to help convey to the marketplac and the public what our rang of view is and where the committe stand on the state of the economi       it might help the public   s assess of our view if we base our forecast on some under polici assumpt rather than on what one might call appropri polici  which might   differ from member to member obvious and would like not be well understood by the public   anyway   one suggest that has alreadi been mention is condit the forecast on the market   s expect fund rate path  for exampl   but in some way state our assumpt or  project about potenti gdp would be import as well becaus that inform  again  will  help the market and market particip understand where the committe is come from    in regard to forward look inform  i think there are a number of thing that the fomc could and should communic  but it current expect about the futur path of the fed fund rate is not one of them   i don   t think that   s a veri good practic in general   howev  i do think that what we need to do is talk more about what our goal are  what our forecast of those goal are  and even more in a qualit sens the process by which we think we   re go to get there   that is to say  talk about how monetari polici will respond to various event   i hesit to use the phrase    decis rule      wouldn   t necessarili say anyth about the futur path of the fed fund rate  but it would be veri inform   it   s critic  as has alreadi been mention  that the fomc member agre on what the goal are   the member don   t need to agre on the model of the economi or the channel by which  they think monetari polici actual oper   inde  given the state of econom scienc  the differ in model and channel can aid in polici format   similar  sinc dissent at this meet are public  dissent should feel free to explain the reason for their dissent   we shouldn   t discourag presid and other member from express their view about the state of the  economi and the process   committe member should be free to indic how their view on the     economi are evolv   in fact  i think that do so support our goal of help the public form sound expect of what polici is actual go to be
thank you   vice chairman
thank you   i want to start by say that i think we   re confront with a set of issu that realli aren   t princip about communic and transpar  i think they   re fundament about how we conduct monetari polici and the monetari polici  regim we   re go to oper under   i want to say a littl about what i see as the hierarchi of challeng or decis we have to  make in that context   we have to have a discuss about what object  particular in term of inflat  will guid this committe   s decis go forward  and i think it   s hard to do that  without a discuss in quantit term   we also need to get in the posit of think and talk through more direct and candid at these meet how we make decis about the most appropri path for inflat and output  especi at  e when we   re way off our basic   object   we don   t realli do that now   we   ve been live with a lot of ambigu about whether  we   re oper with  in effect  an object of get core pce down to some particular level at a certain  e or not  and i don   t think we can be comfort live with that degre of ambigu  much longer   in some way  that set of issu is the first we have to confront   we may not get consensus or resolut  but we have to talk through those issu    we also have to decid what we want to disclos in term of our object  our forecast  the  polici consist with that forecast  and uncertainti   we face a lot of choic in term of what we do and how we do it regard quantit versus qualit and explicit versus implicit approach to communic   sever of you said that in our statement we should simpli say what we decid and whi  but i don   t think it   s quit that simpl   the    whi    has a lot to do with     the forecast  and to say noth about the forecast in the statement would be communic littl about the reason for our polici decis   but the    what    is also not simpl   it is certain not princip about whether or not we move the fed fund rate   the    what    we   re decid has to do a lot with whether we take a view about or tri to chang or valid the market expect go forward over some period   so i don   t think we can get through the choic about communic and transpar by just agre that we want to limit ourselv to the more minimalist object  of communic what we did and whi   it feel to me a littl more complic than that   the third point is a general point   if we are go to chang the regim  we can   t do it piecem   we can   t decid that we want to announc a quantit definit of long term price stabil without confront the kind of disclosur regim that we have to adopt in support of that  also  we can   t think sensibl about the evolut of our disclosur regim around the forecast  for exampl  without come to some greater understand about whether we disclos a quantit object for inflat   so i think they need to be view as a packag   for a similar reason  i think we can   t approach this set of chang by say let   s move on the thing that are easi or less  contenti or have more of a consensus without have a better sens of where we realli want to  go   that  sn   t mean that we should chang all at onc or  if we decid to chang thing  we do them all togeth   we can still decid to have a graduat approach to introduc the chang in  the regim  but befor we make an increment move  we need to have a better sens about where   we want ul  to go   if we don   t have consensus about where we want to go  then it   s harder to  decid what the increment move should be   it  sn   t mean we should be inert     it   s veri healthi to have a candid discuss about what we think is wrong with our current  regim   i use to work with somebodi who said to me     don   t bring me problem without solut      therefor  discomfort with a set of attribut of our regim relat to the experi of     other countri is realli not enough to justifi chang   we have to be abl to look at the propos  for chang and be veri comfort that they   re go to respond to the problem without leav us with a set of other collater risk or disadvantag   it   s also good to have a direct and open discuss about what we do not want to tri to achiev through communic   i   m veri uncomfort with what i think it would be fair to say is a substanti faction in the academ profess now  which say that the op  communic polici of central bank should be to seek veri close align between the market   s expect about futur polici and the central bank   s and to achiev that align in real  e and not have long period of wide diverg  between what the market think and what we think is appropri   that posit strike me as  high unrealist and complic and mayb difficult to achiev  but we should talk through that issu   i think it   s also unrealist to say that we should avoid clariti about our view on the futur  cours of the economi and polici   that pure fog altern seem unsatisfi and uncomfort to me  i have noth to add to the discuss about divers   there are great benefit to divers  i do think we should tri to avoid have  becaus of schedul  mani member of the committe talk in the same period   it is difficult to achiev but worth think about    final i just want to compliment the subcommitte   the way you have laid out the issu is veri nice done   i also want to compliment the chairman for approach this subject veri open   have us tri to think through all the difficult choic involv togeth  and allow some analysi  debat  and a littl competit for idea help inform choic about how we go forward   i think that approach is admir  and i commend you for it
thank you   governor
i   ll be veri brief   i think a number of the point that vice chairman   made are excel  in particular his emphas that we have to think about this as a  packag but not as necessarili mean that we must implement everyth at onc   we may want  to see how the piec are work befor we do that  but we do have to have the ul  goal in mind   we need to have the whole thing togeth befor we can start move forward becaus it  could be quit danger to chang some aspect of communic polici but then realiz that  if  we want to do someth els differ down the line  we   ll have to chang them again   so i think that approach is exact the right one   also becaus what we   re do relat to ani chang  we have to think about the dynam   we see this now in the persist of certain word in our statement   we use the word onc  but  then do we use it again or do we not use it again   individu word take on an incred amount of  import   now  one way to solv that problem is perhap to put out more and more word so that each one is dilut   laughter   an aw lot of privat sector resourc were devot to the three letter word    yet    that came out of one of the statement  when i believ that not a singl member of the fomc even notic it   i think that is problemat   i   m not quit sure of the best way to solv that problem  but i think we have to be veri sensit to that   on the issu of the one versus the whole  the market have a veri strong percept of coordin among us   the notion that the governor are independ and that the feder reserv bank presid are independ is consid laughabl   when peopl ask me about that  they say     well   sn   t he tell you what to do      i say     no  no one tell anyon what to do      mayb you   d like to   laughter  but that   s not how it oper   part of that notion is just a percept  and so have peopl speak at the same  e may not be much of a problem   but the percept is that it   s a coordin effort rather than a seri of individu who are express their view  and i think     communic the extent of our independ or the extent of our coordin is someth that  would actual go a long way toward thing   i was one of those academ that don refer to as  put up those tabl and tri to figur out whether we were independ or not  sort of rate us   but that is not what we   re suppos to be do  and i hope my comment will not be taken in that context    one final remark is that we have to be modest about what we   re tri to do   part of this discuss is the way of convey our uncertainti   i would close my class on money and bank  and i   ll close my remark here  by present a fantast new yorker cartoon   it relat to the former chairman and show someon pray  just befor go to bed  about the former chairman   that he know what he know  he know what he  sn   t know  and he know the differ   it   s  import for us to be abl to tri to convey to the market that we know what we know  we know what we don   t know  and we do know the differ
what if we don   t know what we don   t know   laughter
let me add just a coupl of veri general comment   i hope that in our discuss about communic we   ll be aim to make polici work better   i think  that involv tri to make the market and the public form expect that are at least broad consist with our goal and our strategi and tri to anchor long term inflat expect to the extent possibl   even if you are skeptic about our abil to do this  you may still agre that we want to avoid miscommun and unnecessari volatil to the extent possibl   i agre also that in general we don   t want to provid the futur fund rate path   i see a lot of problem with that   one of the reason not to do it is that  if the market is forc to infer the fund  rate path from econom inform  that infer provid inform to us   otherwis  they   re     simpli repeat what we tell them   in an ideal world  how would we get the market to infer our   expect path   well  we would provid them with a condit forecast with error band and all kind of condit assumpt  and we would tell them about our object function  which  would includ not onli the long term object but also the relat weight on inflat and output and the shape of the risk avers coeffici and the like    now  of cours  we can   t do that   besid the technic difficulti  as has alreadi been point out  we have nineteen veri distinct point of view around the tabl   but i do think there are way to communic this kind of inform to the public   as an exampl  in my monetari polici tes oni i veri conscious   whether it was success or not i leav it to you to judg   talk about our committe project  which gave the public not onli some insight into what our general view were but also inform about our prefer becaus it show a relat gradual declin in inflat   this remov the fear that at least some market particip had that we were go to tri to bring inflat down extrem quick and extrem far   in that respect  it was veri use  and i general agre with presid   and other that more detail and more frequent project might be a veri use way for us to go in the futur    final  sinc we don   t have the budget to hire a semiotician  i do want to express some frustrat with the code languag that we reli on so heavili   i have been expos to some of the pitfal that it can creat   i think that we are reach the limit of what code can provid  and i   d like to encourag us to think about way to use quantit inform  like forecast  to provid more inform and therebi reduc the weight that   s place on ani singl word in statement and  the like   so those are just a few comment   i want to thank everybodi for an excel discuss and for a lot of patienc   i appreci  it veri much   our next meet is on wednesday  septemb     and we are adjourn    nd of meet
