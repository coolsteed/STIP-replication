without object   dino kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were distribut a short  e ago   sinc your last meet  market have been character by a high degre of risk avers   driven  first  by uncertainti about the  e and extent of war in iraq  second  by uncertainti about the under condit of the u s  and other global economi as growth forecast were be trim  and third  by data on the real economi that tend to disappoint market expect   dure most of the intermeet period  investor favor govern bond  their yield declin to new low in mani case  while equiti fell sharpli and the dollar depreci   in the last three or four trade session  howev  mani of those trend were partial or fulli revers  and the price of oil has declin  some attribut these recent price move to investor    op  about the outcom of the war that now seem immin   other see the recent price move as anoth variat of uncertainti  onli this  e the respons was to revert to a neutral postur vis  vis their benchmark   the first page in the materi distribut show u s  and euro area three month deposit rate   for most of the intermeet period three month cash rate were relat stabl in the unit state  as shown by the solid red line   howev  three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward  the dash red line  began to fall in earli march  as the gloom deepen and the data deterior  especi after the employ report of march     surpris  forward rate snap back late last week and the three month rate nine month forward is back to     percent  near where it trade for most of the period   part of that revers may have been due to technic trade factor  but the reviv of equiti price and the grow sens that your meet today would not result in a chang to the target fund rate also play a role   european forward rate  the dash   line  continu to trade below the cash rate  suggest that market expect further eas from the ecb   mani market particip had expect a more aggress    basi point cut at the march   meet of the ecb   the contemporan uptick in euro area forward rate suggest that those rate often remain influenc by their u s  counterpart in the short run       the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     in japan  the announc of a new governor of the bank of japan did not alter expect of persist deflat   with japanes short rate at zero and the econom outlook unchang  the boj   s continu infus of liquid and a search for yield by investor have push fund out the yield curv   the ten year japanes govern bond yield hit a new low of    basi point on march     that compar with a yield of      percent one year ago   in fact  the entir yield curv has been pull down by the weight of the boj   s infus  as shown in the bottom panel  while the boj   s so call nontradit monetari oper have success brought down the jgb yield curv and corpor spread appar have follow  still the amount of borrow in the privat sector and in the secur market is limit  and price on other asset such as equiti and properti continu to fall   turn to page    anoth way of look at monetari condit in major economi is depict there   the five graph on that page show the main polici rate  the blue line  sinc decemb of      for the unit state  the euro area  the unit kingdom  australia  and canada  along with the two year swap rate for each currenc  the red line    by earli march the two year swap rate was trade below the short term polici rate in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and australia  suggest that market were expect a weaker outlook and possibl some monetari eas   in this countri  the two year swap rate fell    basi point from decemb through earli march  track the two year note  which itself hit a record low of      percent on march      in all four case the swap rate move sharpli higher last week   more than   percentag point   as market at least temporarili were will to consid that the glass was half full   interest  canada   s pattern was quit differ from the other   in canada  swap rate began their turnaround at year end  and the bank of canada tighten polici    basi point on march     turn to page    the dollar continu to trade with a soggi tone for much of the intermeet period   part of the dollar   s declin was attribut to weaker econom data  which seem to have had a more pronounc effect on the u s  currenc than weak data had on either the euro area or japanes market and currenc   the reason typic cite is the unit state    relianc on import capit due to the current account deficit   a second factor mention by some was the widen budget deficit forecast  and a third concern was the financ of the war   trader recal that the unit state was reimburs for the vast portion of it expens in the first gulf war  a factor that narrow the current account deficit at that  e and was thought to have benefit the dollar   a similar benefit is not expect this  e around   notwithstand this sen ent  the dollar strengthen in the last week along with most riskier dollar asset   the euro weaken sharpli in the past week to about       as we speak  and european equiti ralli   some attribut the euro   s weak to technic factor  other cite discord within europ on both foreign polici and econom perform issu   still other point to the seem increas volum of bad news come from european bank and insur busi  to give one exampl  in recent day there have been call by promin german for the govern to prepar for the possibl of have to take over one of the larg german bank   the yen   s exchang rate has been rather more subdu   the middl panel graph the dollar   yen exchang rate and show  in gray  period of japanes intervent  although claim to have no exchang rate target  the japanes monetari author have interven consist when the dollar   yen rate has been in the     to     area  dure the intermeet period  the japanes bought about       billion and  ‚¬    million   that is in addit to the rough      billion they bought in januari  so call repatri flow  which actual cover a wide varieti of book close maneuv  tend to wear off by mid march as the necessari transact are complet   with the onset of the new fiscal year and a new team instal at the bank of japan  the market will be focus intent on the polici choic by the govern and central bank offici to reviv the economi   final  the dollar also has been weak sinc last decemb against other currenc  as shown in the bottom panel  although it has had a bit of a bounc in recent day against those currenc as well   the british pound has benefit least from the dollar   s weak  perhap in part becaus of the suspicion that the u k  economi is deceler   but some observ have suggest that the economi may experi some negat backwash from the govern   s decis regard iraq   turn to page   and move back to u s  fix incom market  corpor bond issuanc in januari and februari in both invest grade and high yield market was fair strong  in contrast with the lower year over year level we were see for much of        as shown in the top left panel  the invest grade corpor spread continu to trade below     basi point  which while rather high histor is a signific improv from octob   actual  perhap the news here is that there was no widen in the spread despit the uptick in suppli and the weak equiti market   high yield and emerg market spread also held fair steadi  as shown in the top right panel  especi among select emerg market borrow such as brazil  which has perform well sinc the elect   market commentari suggest that  with investor crave higher yield  these asset class offer a fair

among larg mortgag investor  and impli volatil tend to rise dure period of heighten refinanc activ   in recent week  the mortgag banker associ refi index hit a new high   a level much higher in fact than last autumn   s peak  in that context it   s not surpris that impli volatil among these instrument are high  and it may be a surpris that they are not higher still   the bottom panel graph anoth aspect of the refinanc boom   the blue line is an es  of the durat of the mortgag in the mortgag back secur univers  the burgundi line is the yield on the ten year note   these two do tend to move togeth sinc one way for investor to hedg a shorten of portfolio durat due to a refinanc wave is to buy treasuri   convers  they hedg by sell treasuri when rate rise and durat extend   with the signific growth of the mortgag market  hedg activ among these investor can   and often do   have an impact on the treasuri market   now  i should mention that one small aspect of the recent heavi volum of refinanc is specul that higher prepay will caus a mismatch among some larg mbs holder unabl to adjust their posit quick enough   in particular  some trader appar thought that fanni mae would report a much higher durat gap  as it did dure last autumn   s prepay wave  and that this would impli larg purchas of treasuri and still lower interest rate   in the event  fanni mae report last week that it durat gap for februari had widen by one month  from minus four to minus five month  which was much lower than the market had expect   and the gap stay within fanni   s desir rang of plus six to minus six month   part of the revers in the ten year note last week was appar trigger by disappoint that this gap was not wider  which caus some short cover   on the bright side  some have suggest that  with the spotlight on gses  they are hedg a bit more conserv to avoid the negat public that fanni mae in particular garner last septemb and octob   let me turn to page   and a quick word on reserv   sever meet ago i mention that currenc growth had slow unexpect in late summer and earli autumn   the desk respond by ceas outright oper and shrink our long term repo book to    billion   as currenc growth resum  in the holiday period we first increas the long term repo book  and in the intermeet period we resum our outright purchas for soma  as shown in the panel on page     dure the intermeet period we acquir almost     billion of secur  or just    billion short of the intermeet leeway   look prospect  we do not anticip that the onset of arm conflict will have ani signific effect on the demand for excess reserv or otherwis upset financ market   in a review of bank    behavior dure the      gulf war  there was no evid that bank increas their demand for excess reserv   howev  analyz that period is made more difficult becaus of the sharp reduct in reserv requir that becam effect in decemb       a few week befor the war began   nonetheless  we will be on the lookout for ani sign that shift in financ pattern or flow across asset market might be upset normal condit in financ market  and we will adjust our oper or provis of excess reserv accord   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper   i will need a vote to approv domest oper  and i   d be happi to answer ani question
question for dino   governor
dino  on page   you   ve shown us both the two year swap rate and the polici rate for various countri   i   m tri to understand if there is ani polici implic or mean in the relationship we see in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and australia versus those in canada and the unit state   obvious in those first three market the two year swap rate has trade down  and at some point it fell below the target polici rate   in a coupl of case  we   ve seen that the monetari author made some polici adjust   so how should one think about that relationship  if at all  between the two year swap rate and the polici rate  particular in the case where the swap rate has trade occasion below the polici rate
that   s a great question   the committe spoke about the canadian situat last  e as someth of an outlier  and one can see that here as well   i think one way to view this is that the market probabl   consid the prospect for the unit state and canada as somewhat better than for the euro area and the unit kingdom   the case of australia is a bit more interest   i don   t know to what degre technic factor are involv there   the australian economi has perform extrem well  and perhap the market are snif out a slowdown that   s not in the forecast   at least most forecast that i   ve seen for australia don   t show that it situat will becom similar to that which the euro area and japan are in now or toward which mani peopl think the unit kingdom is head   so we might be get an inkl here that perhap the market is inde look for a better perform prospect in the unit state as they are for canada
are there ani risk differenti between the two year swap and the govern or central bank rate   we   re look at the shape of the yield curv
yes  i could have use the two year note  but that creat a differ problem of credit differenti among countri   so  i decid to take the two year swap rate across all of these countri   but i think we would see the same kind of pattern   although the level would be differ   if we use the two year note   the number would be somewhat lower becaus of the differenti between the two year note and the two year swap rate
incident  i   ve alway presum that the gses could essenti construct whatev durat gap they want and that the onli issu was the cost of do it   sinc freddi tend to have a much narrow gap than fanni  is it correct to presum that they are will to pay the insur premium to creat that gap wherea fanni is not
yes  i think that   s a good interpret  and i believ that   s the analysi that most in the market have made   interest though  one would have thought  that be the case  that freddi would be reward with a higher pe in it equiti  but one  sn   t see that  one could argu that they are be more prudent and are protect against risk a littl better  but that is not show up in the way investor are assess their equiti
well  aren   t there other factor that determin the size of the pe   i assum profit is one   it  sn   t necessarili follow that the pe is not affect by the durat gap
the other obvious factor  mr  chairman  would be earn growth  a willing to run your book with a littl less insur might also be associ with effort to expand the overal size of the balanc sheet and to increas earn   in fact  fanni   s earn growth has been fa  than freddi   s
it has been fa  becaus fanni is will to take more risk  which is your point about how much insur a gse is will to take out
i think what is realli happen is that the manag of freddi mac   when one discuss this with their chairman it   s veri clear      not want to take as much risk as fanni     in my view  howev  the market is much too inclin to see fanni and freddi as if they   re two ident compani and their pes not be the same is a market imperfect   obvious there are various factor that can affect the pes  but i think it is the case that freddi is more conserv run and is not reward for it
so the bottom line is that that   s bad judgment on their part
i think the bottom line is that it   s good judgment on their part   it just show that market are not perfect after all
dino  my question is on the japanes govern yield curv shown on page     would you interpret the declin in the yield curv over the last year as a chang in inflat or deflat expect  or is it a chang in liquid premium as a result of the net suppli of bond and the demand for liquid   can you pars it between those two
i think it   s veri difficult to pars   if you push me  i would probabl say that the market in the last year has becom more inclin to think that deflat has becom ever more entrench   therefor  market particip tend to feel that the risk of be bad burn in the near term by buy a ten year bond is low  which i think is probabl a mistak   so i   d say it   s probabl more price expect than the demand for liquid  but obvious it   s a veri difficult issu to pars
we do see the spread between the synthet and the benchmark ten year issu go down signific  which suggest that liquid is improv
yes  that   s an interest point  and i   ve ask about that   one explan i   m hear is that liquid is improv  which it probabl is   the other one is that we   re not see much suppli   japanes corpor are still not borrow  and investor are starv for yield   one can buy a lot of govern paper at a return of close to zero percent   so if one can get some ten year paper with a   percent handl  that look pretti good   the risk notwithstand
we don   t have ani survey data or other inform on long term deflat expect
i don   t know of ani      have you seen anyth
no  noth that would go out far enough to answer the question
it is interest in one sens  though  that the curv has been pull down  interest rate are lower  and spread have come in  yet the economi realli   not seem to be abl to respond   so it   rais the question of whether a flat yield curv produc better prospect for the economi
the other point i   d make  governor bernank  is that in the index debt market in the unit state  as the chairman note  the ten year yield is down more than     point over that same year   so we can   t rule out the possibl that what we   re see is a shift lower of world real interest rate
that   s certain the case with the tip   further question for dino   if not  vice chair
i move approv of the domest oper  mr  chairman
without object  they are approv   we now move on to the staff report   dave   and    son
we face some rather consider challeng in assembl this forecast   the largest one  of cours  be to find a way to be help to you in set monetari polici in a period when the probabl of immin militari conflict with iraq has becom veri high   earli last fall  the chairman commenc one of our pre fomc brief session by ask whether the  book forecast was ignor the eleph in the room   the eleph be the potenti for war   we respond that we were well awar of that possibl   but we believ that a forecast construct to take explicit account of militari conflict would focus attent on area about which we knew veri littl and would distract us from provid you with our interpret of incom data and the under forc oper on the economi  still  we recogn then that  by incorpor develop in oil futur and financi market  our forecast was  in effect  reflect the evolv likelihood of militari action in iraq   well  in this forecast  the room has becom veri small and the eleph veri larg   as you know  we opt for an approach that we think preserv maximum continu with recent forecast   we have continu to take on board the path of oil price impli by futur market  current read in financi market  and recent measur of consum sen ent   these indic  of cours  embodi a probabl weight averag of a wide rang of possibl outcom  reflect the collect judgment of market particip and survey respond   at this point  it seem safe to presum that they place a veri substanti weight on an immin war   as event unfold in the come day and week  read on mani variabl condit our baselin forecast will shift  as outcom current embodi in that probabl weight distribut becom more or less like   oil price  equiti valu  and sen ent are almost certain go to deviat   perhap substanti   from the path assum in the forecast   we attempt to give you a sens in the  book of those factor on which we will be most focus and some rough quantit assess of the sensit of the forecast to movement in those variabl   at this point  you probabl need littl convinc that we don   t know what will happen in the week ahead with respect to conflict with iraq or it econom consequ   but  you may reason ask  what are the econom data and financi market develop of the past seven week tell us about the under condit of the u s  economi as we head into this critic period   if anyon   s hope have risen momentarili that i will answer that question clear  let me admit up front that i cannot   a quick look at the top line of our forecast might suggest that we have learn a great deal about the economi and that what we   ve learn has been decid negat   after all  we   ve revis down project growth in the first half of this year to about    percent at an annual rate  about    percentag point less than in our januari forecast   but in point of fact  owe to an upward revis to growth in the fourth quarter of last year  the level of real gdp is actual higher  on averag  in the first half of this year than in our last forecast   one of the key surpris in the incom data was that inventori were not as lean in the fourth quarter of last year as we had thought   higher inventori invest account for all the    percentag point upward adjust to the growth of real gdp last quarter  final sale were about unrevis   with that stockbuild alreadi behind us  we see less upward impetus to activ from this sourc in the first half of this year   inde  a smaller contribut from non auto inventori more than account for the downward revis that we have made to our project of activ in the first half of this year   the recent data on spend  labor market  and product have present the usual mix bag   for the most part  the strength in spend that was appar late last year carri into januari   to be sure  sale of new motor vehicl in januari drop off from the veri high level observ in decemb  but other consum outlay advanc at a rapid clip   hous activ   both sale and construct   jump to veri high level  aid by good weather and veri favor financ condit   in the busi sector  order and shipment of capit good in januari exceed our expect  with spend for high tech equip post an especi sharp rise   but the pictur in februari and into march was not near so bright   motor vehicl sale post anoth steep declin last month   snowstorm in the east evid clobber sale in late februari  but report for earli march suggest that there has been onli a modest bounceback so far   face with sag sale and mount inventori  vehicl maker have announc signific cutback in product in the second quarter   a sign that they  too  are concern about some under weak in demand   retail sale apart from motor vehicl declin last month as well  and this morn   s hous start releas   which show singl famili start off near    percent  to     million unit in februari   can be ad to the list of downbeat indic for that month   read on the labor market and industri activ also worsen in februari and have shown littl sign of improv this month   we were especi struck by the widespread weak impli by last month   s labor market report   privat payrol contract by         in februari   no doubt  bad weather contribut to the declin in construct employ  and the call up of reservist like crimp payrol more broad   but tri as we might  we could find no silver line in februari   s employ situat   our januari forecast was built on the assumpt that employ would be about flat earli this year  instead  job loss have averag about         over the past three month   industri product is also come in below our earlier expect   declin late last year now look to be larger than previous es   and factori output is expect to eke out a much smaller gain this quarter than we had project in januari   although the declin in product wit last fall seem to have abat  there appear to be littl upward momentum to manufactur activ   that view is support by the avail purchas survey  which have recent retrac earlier gain   it is  of cours  exceed difficult  if not imposs  to determin whether this most recent soften in the data reflect under weak in the economi or the intensifi effect of war relat fear and uncertainti   virtual all our major econom indic at this point could be direct or indirect influenc by action or expect relat to the possibl of war   is consum confid low becaus of higher war relat energi price or becaus the labor market is so soft   is the labor market soft becaus firm are hesit to hire in advanc of an immin war or becaus product demand is weak   i don   t know of ani way to confid break into that argument   moreov  i don   t think this is a signal extract problem face sole by the staff and other econom forecast   i serious doubt that household and busi can reliabl disentangl under econom trend from effect relat to possibl militari conflict   suffic it to say that  whatev the fundament caus  the staff see the economi on a somewhat shallow trajectori than we had earlier expect   moreov  a number of other factor led us to mark down a bit our project growth of real gdp over the next year and a half   for one  stock price at the close of the  book were about    percent below those anticip in our previous forecast  and we lower our project path by a similar amount   the effect of lower equiti price was onli part offset by the accompani downward revis that we have made to long term interest rate   i should note  howev  that the rise in equiti market sinc we close the forecast  if sustain  would  all els be equal  lead us to add back in much of the final demand we had taken out of the forecast   higher current and project oil price  especi over the next few quarter  are expect to take a larger bite out of household incom than in the januari project   perhap reflect to some extent higher energi price  consum sen ent has weaken notic sinc the end of last year   consum    view of their own financi condit  broader busi condit  buy condit  and the labor market situat have all deterior notic in recent month   sen ent has drop by more than can be explain by macroeconom condit  and in the forecast we expect this unusu weak in household attitud and their effect on consumpt to fade onli gradual over the next year and a half   not all of the key forc oper on the economi have been negat   fiscal polici  in particular  is provid more upward s ulus to activ than in our previous project   we have defens spend ramp up more sharpli in this forecast compar with the last   we have ad about     billion to project defens spend in both      and        separ  we have retain the packag of tax cut assum in the januari forecast  though we have delay it project implement to the third quarter of this year   meanwhil  tax receipt have been come in much lower than we had expect  larg reflect anoth year of unexpect larg refund   smaller tax payment are provid a notic buffer against weaker labor incom in this forecast and help to sustain the project growth in consum spend   despit the small net downward revis that we have made to the project  we continu to expect a gradual acceler of activ in the second half of this year and into      for reason that will sound quit familiar to you   s ul monetari and fiscal polici contribut to the pickup  as   a gradual diminish of the drag from earlier declin in the stock market   product growth show no sign of flag and should feed gain in both household incom and corpor profit  final  we expect the unusu restraint on household and busi spend  which we are attribut in part to pessim and uncertainti  to fade over the project interv   as has been the case for some  e  this featur of the forecast must be consid more art than scienc   even as art  i   ll admit it   s closer to jackson pollock than to rembrandt    laughter   with slack in resourc util persist throughout the forecast period  core inflat is expect to reced modest in      and        inde  core pce price inflat drop to   percent in the second half of next year   in work on this forecast  we   perhap like mani other in the economi   have felt as if we were bide our  e  wait for event to unfold and the situat to clarifi itself   but how much clarif of econom circumst can be expect   certain  a quick and success resolut of the conflict with iraq could be follow by a sharp declin in oil price and a jump in equiti valu   household and busi sen ent could improv swift and persist   with just a short lag  some high frequenc read on the economi might provid evid of follow through to the real economi  initi claim  chain store sale  and report from automak would provid the earli evid on that score   with luck  those read would be confirm by broader month measur of spend  product  and labor market condit   while it is less pleasant to contempl  circumst could clear indic a much less favor outcom   the use of weapon of mass destruct  substanti damag to the oil field  or slow militari progress could result in sizabl advers reaction in oil and financi market and a further sour of sen ent   the consequ of these develop could be reflect clear in the flow of data on the real economi   in either event  a signific narrow of uncertainti would allow us to get a much better fix on macroeconom condit and provid you with clearer direct on the appropri set of monetari polici   but a third possibl seem emin plausibl   name  that there will not be in the month immedi ahead a dramat shrinkag in the uncertainti surround under econom condit   there are a number of reason for suspect that this might be the case   under the best of circumst  financi market will be volatil  and the data on the economi will be both noisi and often avail with onli a frustrat lag   it could take month to detect the econom consequ of the event that will unfold in the period ahead   moreov  the best of circumst may not present themselv   even if the militari situat conclud as quick and success as it did in       broader geopolit risk may linger in a way that they did not after the earlier gulf war   the threat of terrorist respons may not declin and could conceiv increas even in the wake of a success militari campaign  as a consequ  the current hesit to spend and hire may not diminish rapid  moreov  there have been addit sourc of geopolit tension in recent month   north korea and iran  to name just two   we will need to be watch of euphor reaction in financi market and among household and busi   those initi read may signal a more vigor rebound from recent doldrum  but that enthusiasm could prove unjustifi over  e by the under fundament   if so  the favor initi reaction signal by asset price and sen ent would fade  final  there could be a real econom bounc follow the success conclus of a war   some firm might act on spend and hire plan that were delay by war fear   household  too  may boost spend that had been defer by worri about war and the accompani high level of price for gasolin and heat fuel   wit such a rebound  howev  will provid no assur that the economi is move onto a more persist vigor growth path   if the under health of the economi remain lacklust  a temporari period of abov trend growth could give way  yet again  to subpar perform   in effect  circumst might be similar to a year ago   as the worst case scenario follow the attack of septemb    fail to materi  we saw a rapid acceler of activ that could not be sustain by the under condit of the economi   i don   t want to exagger in either direct here   clear  we   re like to know a great deal more than we do now should a swift and success militari action be complet in the period ahead   but i suspect that  even in those circumst  you will see onli a partial lift of the fog of uncertainti that current shroud the econom outlook      son will now continu our present
in put togeth the baselin forecast for the rest of the world  the staff in the intern financ divis grappl with the same issu that confront those forecast the domest economi  but spread over a wide rang of countri   with the outbreak of war perceiv by mani to be like and soon  a host of indic and market variabl abroad implicit reflect the weight averag of market expect as to the  e of the onset of hostil and the implic of subsequ event for econom activ around the globe   of cours these variabl also reflect develop in the under econom fundament  which no doubt have chang somewhat sinc we prepar the januari forecast   the clearest instanc in which market expect have provid answer to critic question that we otherwis were at a loss to answer is the assum path for oil price in the forecast   as in the past  we have incorpor into the baselin forecast the futur path for crude oil as observ in the market at the  e the  book forecast was be final   that path start with the price for west texa intermedi at an averag valu of        for the current quarter and has it drop more than       by the end of this year and near anoth       dollar by the end of next year   although some volatil in oil price in the veri short run is to be expect  a sizabl declin in global crude oil price from current level  start by midyear  is an essenti factor in our baselin forecast for global growth  that forecast has some continu near term weak give way to growth at an annual rate of about   percent on averag in the second half of this year and     percent next year   the implic of less favor develop with respect to oil price vari somewhat  depend on how long the price of oil remain elev and whether a given countri is an oil export or import   we review the staff model   s assess of the effect of some altern in januari dure the chart show   a sharp spike up in oil price that persist for two quarter  what we term the limit embargo case  by itself impli negat effect this year on gdp growth in the major foreign economi that rang from neglig to a reduct of   percentag point  altern  oil price could fall further or fa  than impli in the futur curv  with posit effect on growth   a second major factor under the forecast is the state of busi and consum confid that is incorpor in the forecast  but we cannot quantifi these variabl in the way that we can for oil price   in recent week  confid has react both to the chang prospect of the onset of war and to news about econom fundament   as we report in the  book  consum confid survey have move down further recent  particular in europ   we are also look for veri sluggish or declin domest demand in the euro area and japan dure the first quarter   nonetheless  our project for an acceler of activ abroad over the forecast period includ a strengthen in domest demand in mani countri that  in turn  is consist with a moder and sustain improv in confid   a quick and pronounc move in confid in either direct  trigger by geopolit event  could produc a signific deviat from our baselin outlook   sharpli higher oil price could well combin with a fall in confid   the version of such joint develop that i includ in the januari chart show impli reduct in growth rate of   to   percentag point in the foreign industri countri this year   a posit bounc in sen ent abroad is a clear upsid risk to our forecast  and foreign real gdp has consider scope in most countri to grow fa  without threaten capac constraint or heighten price pressur   we have incorpor specif assumpt about monetari polici action in the foreign industri countri  which support the recoveri of econom activ in our baselin view and are broad consist with market expect for rate   we expect that the ecb will lower it offici rate anoth    basi point by midyear  as fall oil price  consider slack in the economi  and strength in the exchang valu of the euro contribut to improv in inflat perform   we have assum that the bank of england will move rate down anoth    basi point later this year as u k  inflat also diminish   in contrast  we see the bank of canada keep it offici rate at it present level through the end of this year  as the canadian economi remain near potenti and inflat declin from elev rate thank to lower oil price and some exchang rate appreci   should develop surpris us and the market and the outlook for activ diverg from our baselin  there is some scope for monetari polici abroad to react  clear  lower oil price  stronger confid  and more posit prospect for growth would impli stronger activ   such a develop might result in the major foreign central bank choos not to eas further   on the downsid  persist high oil price  even weaker confid  and reduc growth prospect might elicit immedi eas and more cumul eas than we now assum   with rate now at     percent or higher in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and canada  the central bank in these economi do have some room for maneuv on the downsid   the bank of japan  which we assum will keep rate at essenti zero throughout the forecast period  has been caught up in the problem pose by the zero bound for some  e   the swiss nation bank has recent reduc it target rate near to zero  so it has littl room to eas further use that tool   our crystal ball is least abl to help us anticip the reaction of the foreign exchang valu of the dollar to come event   a circumst in which we often find ourselv   in the day just befor the  book forecast was complet  the dollar react to downward pressur that appear to relat  in part  to heighten risk for war in the near term   we react to market develop by adjust down slight our path for the real weight averag broad dollar index   sinc  book day  howev  the nomin dollar has rebound somewhat   with the broad index rise more than    percent in nomin term  appar on news that action in iraq is immin   i hesit even to offer a guess as to which way the dollar will move in reaction to futur good news or bad news on event in iraq   to the extent that the dollar turn out stronger than we have project  export will be restrain and import encourag   howev  these partial effect could be offset by effect on export and import from growth outcom here and abroad that differ from the baselin   we receiv data for the u s  balanc of payment in the fourth quarter after the  book was complet   those data confirm that the ex post compon of the financ of our current account deficit shift dure        privat foreign net purchas of u s  secur slow from their record pace in       and foreign direct invest inflow fell sharpli   these smaller privat inflow were offset by a drop to zero in the appetit of u s  investor for foreign secur   balanc these chang and the larger current account deficit was a sizabl increas in foreign offici acquisit of dollar asset   these shift reinforc in our mind the judgment that market particip are unlik to be will to continu to add indefinit to their claim on the unit state at current exchang rate   so we continu to put into the forecast a slight downward tilt to the path for the real exchang valu of the dollar   howev  we recogn that over the forecast period the dollar could in fact rise at  e  and even on balanc  as the host of geopolit and econom risk now present in the global economi are resolv   my final observ is that the project recoveri in u s  output growth remain among the most import factor under our baselin forecast for growth abroad  we see various idiosyncrat econom fundament factor in the individu foreign economi as shape our outlook and as condit the reaction abroad to near term geopolit event   nevertheless  ani develop that would signific chang the outlook for u s  econom activ would have major repercuss abroad     and i will glad tri to answer your question
question for our colleagu   presid broaddus
i had a question  mr  chairman   but first i want to thank   veri much for the memo she sent out a coupl of week ago   that was veri help to me in understand some of the obstacl to adjust oversea in particular  and it relat to some of the thing you just said   my question  dave  is about the tax cut assumpt   i don   t know what it mean to say    other thing be equal    these day  but you retain the assumpt that the tax cut will be pass   my sens is that the probabl that it will not be enact  or that it will be pare down signific  has risen recent   i just wonder what that might impli for your forecast
obvious that remain a polit forecast  and it   s an assumpt that i can   t say we hold with enorm convict   i would point out that the magnitud of the tax cut that we have built into this forecast is close to the figur around which the moder in the hous and senat are coalesc   that  sn   t necessarili add to it credibl  it mere indic that it is a magnitud that is still be discuss activ   i would point out that we had built in a sizabl fiscal s ulus packag in decemb       when the prospect for the economi look quit bleak   we took that out of our project in januari of last year  when the polit bubbl around that type of packag had simmer down signific   then within three week the congress pass a s ulus packag that was almost exact what we had project origin   so it   s aw hard to know what will happen on the fiscal side   i   m not even sure how the progress of the war would add to or subtract from the probabl that the packag would be implement   i can see argument on either side  now  in term of it consequ for the project  it   s a notic plus to dispos incom and therefor help to sustain the growth in consum spend   so it play a veri import role in the second half pickup that we   re project   if we were to take that out of the forecast  we would probabl still be show some under acceler in activ  in part becaus of these other imponder such as an overal improv in household and busi sen ent   but econom growth would be slower than in this forecast   i do think it   s an import factor in support dispos incom in the project
dave  a common theme of mani forecast is that a gradual slow of consum spend  especi for durabl and residenti invest  will be more than offset by a pickup in busi invest   somewhat in contrast to that  the  book forecast consider strength in spend for durabl and for residenti invest   as a matter of fact  such spend acceler in the second half of the year  and expenditur for durabl good grow   percent in      with market rate  on treasuri in particular  rise   i was wonder if you could comment on whi the project show that strength and if you think it might be fair op ist
there are a few reason that we think that by      we will see reason robust gain in consum durabl spend   one is the overal interest rate environ in this forecast  which i think is general more favor than in the consensus forecast   we have built in no increas in the feder fund rate through the end of      and we have
there is a mention of an increas in treasuri rate
there   s a littl drift up in treasuri rate  which is offset in our view by a compress of privat spread as the overal economi improv   two  we   re expect the relat price of durabl good to continu to declin and to declin quit rapid  in essenc  we think the user cost of purchas those good will be relat low   three  it   s also a reflect of our es  for potenti output growth  which is still obvious to the high side of the consensus forecast   i think that help to sustain overal growth in household incom as well as in corpor profit and therefor provid some boost   so we believ there are logic fundament for whi consum durabl spend should increas   i must say on the hous side that we also have veri favor mortgag interest rate   that could be a littl on the op ist side in light of this morn   s data releas and a few read recent of just a bit more soft there   i   m not so sure  had we had all of that inform befor we did our forecast  that we would have been quit so op ist on the hous invest side
dave  let me ask a question about the structur labor product chart  in your forecast  the contribut from capit deepen stay relat low go forward  and yet the multifactor product number remain fair strong   you also talk about the slump in invest spend   what is your think on the multifactor aspect of product and whi it will stay so strong as we go forward
our basic think has been that one need to resort to a supposit of reason strong multifactor product to explain the incred strength in labor product that we   ve had over the past two year   if anyth  our straightforward statist filter model would want to put in more multifactor product growth than we   ve written down in this forecast   now  obvious this involv some fair big risk   mayb this product improv in the last year and a half will turn out to have been  in essenc  some signific cyclic rise in product  as firm are squeez harder on their product facil and on their worker to eke out more product gain   as you know  in the initi phase of this more recent acceler of product  that was general the stori that we bought into   but we   ve been beaten down by the data quarter after quarter  suggest that we have to give a littl weight in this forecast   and we have   to the possibl that multifactor product has continu to improv   we have it at rough     percentag point  which by the histor standard of the past     year is not an especi larg figur
the onli reason i was ask is that  with a hold back in invest and therefor limit gain from new technolog  i wonder whether we can continu to harvest that   i don   t disagre with you becaus it   s hard to explain otherwis
i think you   re right  though   obvious  if whatev is hold back invest spend were to persist longer than we have project in this forecast  it would be harder in some sens to embodi technolog improv go forward   that could have some follow through effect on multifactor product as well
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought dave and   did a fabul job  both in the written materi and in the present  of cover in effect the entir waterfront of risk and possibl to consid as we sit here and tri to determin how this situat is go to turn out   i know i was impress by the complex involv in tri to do it over the past coupl of week   you certain have indic how vari the possibl are and how great the risk are   perhap on both side   that bring me to the question i would like to pose  look just at the  book baselin forecast  absent the altern simul and absent the realli interest discuss of up and down and in and out of oil price and whatnot  it seem to me that one would have to say   though i know you won   t say this    laughter  that the risk almost have to be on the downsid of the  book project  everyth has to go veri well for that forecast to work out   the war has to be short  and it has to be relat cheap   consum and busi have to leap right back into the saddl   even if everyth work out so well that this forecast   materi  then we still have a good deal of excess capac linger on through        aren   t the risk on the downsid
well  you   re right that i   m not go to conced that point immedi    laughter   in fact  one of the thing that we did in prepar for this forecast was to look at some of what we call good case and bad case scenario   as you know  our forecast is not base on all the good thing that would necessarili follow from a quick resolut of the conflict becaus the probabl distribut that the forecast is predic upon includ some negat outcom   so suppos in the next few week we do have a swift and success complet of the militari campaign   oil price could tumbl and perhap tumbl consider in the near term   and even in the longer term base on what the futur market are current expect   we could get a much sharper and more immedi snapback in consum and busi confid   we have built in a gradual rebound in confid   in the case of household  the hit on confid that we   ve seen  sn   t erod until some  next year  and on the busi spend side that   not occur until the end of this year   suppos that happen more immedi   one could easili envis   mayb we   ve alreadi seen it to some extent   a pop in equiti market and some of the risk that were weigh on market go away   we fed those type of assumpt into the model  and it was easi to get an extra percentag point on gdp by the end of      and    percentag point less on the unemploy rate   so i think there is a probabl mass on the upsid  now  there are some obvious and rather signific risk to the downsid as well  and i hope i hint at them in my remark   certain  one could envis all sort of bad outcom in iraq   but even put asid those risk  a chunk of this forecast reli on an improv in invest spend   essenti whatev has been depress invest spend goe away  there is not a lot of scienc one can bring to bear on that  so there are downsid risk associ with that forecast   we saw a pattern of strength around the turn of the year follow by weak  but it is hard to do a signal extract from that   the recent data have been quit soft  and we see noth yet in the data that hint at the acceler in activ that we   re forecast  it look to us as if the economi is just continu to move along at this subpar baselin rate of growth  but we don   t see mani sign that thing are fall apart either   so if you were hope to pin some of our forecast on develop that we actual are abl to put our finger on  we can   t do that   it still involv more forecast than anyth appar in the direct econom read
thank you  mr  chairman   i had a question for   also on the risk to the forecast   i notic that in your forecast the person save rate increas and then flatten out dure        histor  the save rate is a coupl of percentag point higher than that rate   i had two question on this   first  is that where you would expect it to settl on a longer term basi   second  how serious is the risk to the forecast that the save rate will actual be higher dure this period
our best guess is that we still have a littl way to go on the save rate  but not a lot further  in respons to the deterior that has occur in household balanc sheet   we have model that put the save rate anywher between   and   percent in the long run  but i think somewher around   percent or just north of that is probabl the right territori  the question is how do we get there   second  could we get there more rapid than we have project   obvious  the answer to the second question is    yes  we could      but i do not see that as much of a concern   household have been subject to a number of veri signific shock over the last coupl of year   the substanti declin in the stock market  the recess  and the terrorist attack   and none of them seem to result in a pullback on the spend side  a big increas in precautionari save   the combin of all of those develop didn   t seem to produc an unusu jump in the save rate   given the uncertainti that peopl are face in the event ahead of us  mayb we will see a pickup in the save rate   but i don   t quit see that happen exogen   in mani respect i   d say that consumpt has follow our model quit close  which suggest a consider lag in the adjust of household spend to deterior in consum balanc sheet   so i think it   s a risk but not one that i   d put at the top of the list of risk that we   re face   but obvious  go forward  one could pictur event that could engend the kind of fear or concern on the part of household that could produc a higher rate of precautionari save   that matter a lot in our forecast   if we were to get a signific step up in the save rate relat to our baselin forecast  that would weigh veri heavili on the outlook go forward
i have a brief comment on that   there are a lot of news report about compani cancel their contribut to     k  plan as an economi move   that might lead individu to reduc their contribut  which would tend to bring the save rate down   i don   t know how extens that is  but we certain hear report that mani compani are move in that direct now
we   ve heard those report as well   i   m not quit sure how that would net out or quantit how signific it would be at this point
if nobodi els has question or comment  who would like to start the discuss   presid broaddus
thank you  mr  chairman   for a while in januari it look as if activ was strengthen moder in our region  especi in the manufactur sector   that made us someth of an outlier in the commentari in the beig book  but we fell back in line in februari   our month index from our survey of the manufactur and servic sector drop sharpli for the most part last month   some of that obvious was relat to the heighten war anxieti and concern about rise gasolin price   the sever weather in februari  particular around the presid    day weekend  hit our district especi hard and clear play a signific role in the appar soften   that is good news  i guess  if it suggest that at least some of the soften was transitori rather than persist   unemploy rate were below the nation level in sever of our district state  but the rate in north  ina  which is our largest state  was at almost   percent in decemb   the latest month for which we have data   becaus of the weak in manufactur there  not all of the news in our district is bad   there have been a few fair substanti plant expans in our region  indic at least some increas in busi spend   as for hous activ  the nation report for this past month was weak   i don   t recal what the region profil was in that report  but we don   t see ani signific weaken in hous activ in our district  also  let me mention one particular bright spot in the manufactur sector   the fifth district is one of the world   s lead produc  if not the lead produc  of duct tape    laughter   that industri is do veri well  thank you   we gain our duct tape promin becaus the origin fiber use to give the tape strength was cotton   jack guynn   s peopl grew it  and we manufactur it   so that   s a littl southern econom histori lesson for you this morn at no charg  turn to the nation economi  i would describ the  book forecast as easi to love  all thing consid  and i hope we get someth that   s at least in the neighborhood of it  the question  of cours   there are a lot of question  but this a key one   is whether we can reason expect such a relat favor outcom with the fund rate at a sustain    percent level  as is assum in the baselin forecast   obvious  no one know the answer to that in the current high uncertain situat but my own view is that the  book forecast is plausibl   clear  the economi is struggl current under the weight of all the uncertainti  and the downsid risk are obvious materi   nevertheless  in some contrast to my neighbor cathi here  i think it   s easi to exagger both the current weak and the downsid risk in the outlook  consider though they are   i certain recogn that they are consider   as the  book point out  a persist increas in oil price could lead to a signific slow in economi activ   but as we   ve said alreadi this morn  futur market are not expect that   if we don   t get a persist increas in oil price  i think that signific reduc the likelihood that the most recent weak in labor market and retail sale will cumul and worsen   moreov  look through the recent data  the prospect of continu robust trend product growth should eventu produc some reviv of invest and should support commensur growth in household spend   the s ul monetari and fiscal polici that are alreadi in place both support the adjust process   we   re alreadi see at least some reviv of invest in some section of the tech sector  final  our credibl for low inflat mean that neither rise actual inflat nor rise inflat expect pose much of a risk for the recoveri   so i think we have a solid under base for recoveri   to be sure  we may experi some sort of disinfl if the economi continu to adjust to the higher trend product growth   that could pose some complic in the transit  and i think we need to monitor that care   outright deflat  sn   t appear to be a strong threat at this point   but i continu to think that this committe should be prepar to deal with the risk of deflat if unfavor develop such as a protract war in iraq or some negat shock or success of negat shock   like a seri of terrorist attack  for exampl   forc us closer to the zero bound   i   d like to come back to that later for just about a minut when we have our polici go around
thank you  mr  chairman   our view regard the second district  the nation economi  and the intern economi are all cloud by uncertainti   so rather than share our confus about those three subject  i   d like to talk about the uncertainti   what we do not know is the degre to which that uncertainti is realli geopolit   as for a war against iraq  the near certainti of quick militari victori and the aftermath of a more stabl middl east are the veri posit hope   unfortun  the more convers i have with peopl who know about the middl east  the less certain they are of a stabl aftermath   i think it is almost certain that we   ll be veri success militarili   howev  there is not a singl neighbor countri of iraq that can be deem to be stabl  so the shock of a militari attack against their neighbor could bring about veri uncertain consequ either sooner or later   therefor  i believ that the geopolit uncertainti is like to remain  in my view  a consider amount of the uncertainti voic by american busi leader in the name of geopolit is in fact a cover stori for their concern about the direct of the economi   they are not certain whether the consum will hang in there as we hope he will  they aren   t certain whether it is a good idea to make the busi fix invest decis that our forecast call for   the effect on them of the enron arthur andersen worldcom debacl is that it is much easier to avoid make decis than to make them   if you as a busi execut make a decis  even if you happen to be right  the board of director or sharehold may deem you to be excess risk orient   if you make a decis and it turn out to be wrong  those veri same director and sharehold can punish you sever   on the other hand  if you do noth  you appear to be studious and virtuous   now  no economi can prosper and no busi can prosper if that degre of caution continu for ani extend period of  e   but it  sn   t have to continu for veri long to make the downsid of our forecast turn out to be like  one thing that i think could milit against that is if the war is veri success veri quick  as i think it will be  and if the advers geopolit aftermath is later rather than soon and therefor the situat look veri good for a while   then i think our presid  with his rather remark leadership skill  could turn those skill to the economi  and we could see a burst of confid stem from the notion that somebodi is realli in charg   if you   ve been in charg and have just won a war  that show formid leadership   i think that could well happen  and obvious by mention it  i rather hope it    in the midst of all this uncertainti what   a prudent central banker do   it seem to me that a prudent central banker think a lot    noth  talk as littl as possibl  and make it veri clear that the central bank is veri attent and readi to take action when and if requir  thank you
mr  chairman  econom activ in the tenth district  as in other region  remain basic sluggish  though we have had a few sign of improv on mix data sinc the last meet   retail sale have increas onli slight from the disappoint holiday season  and commerci real estat is still mire in a veri deep slump in our area   on the posit side  though  manufactur activ actual has strengthen a littl sinc the last meet  and energi activ has pick up notic   hous continu to provid support to district activ  with solid sale of low end home make up for some slump in the high end part of that market   on the inflat front  wage and price pressur obvious remain pretti well subdu  in speak with our director and with a lot of busi peopl throughout our district  i consist hear that busi are reluct to commit to new spend and hire until the uncertainti of the current situat with iraq is resolv   this wait and see attitud also describ consum sen ent more and more as it relat to new spend   howev  not to overst this uncertainti factor  i would also note that in colorado  for exampl  attitud are distinct pessimist and veri much unrel to the war   mani peopl in that state see veri strong parallel between now and the slump that they went through in the     s  with a lot of excess capac and a lot of pessim in play  let me talk a littl more about manufactur activ becaus it actual show some improv on balanc in februari   product and shipment rose abov year ago level  and new order regist a fair larg increas   in fact one of the largest sinc earli        firm continu to express op  about product and sale over the next six month onc we get through some of this immedi geopolit uncertainti   howev  employ and capit spend has remain well below year ago level  and firm are keep their inventori low in case the higher sale they expect do not materi   in our survey about attitud among manufactur  it is a fact that as they look forward they are more op ist  as they feel they can get through this immedi crisi   so i think there is that element   but  again  i go back to colorado as evid that other factor are oper as well  let me talk veri quick about the farm economi  which is actual expect to strengthen in        farm incom in term of cash receipt is expect to improv  and farmer also are go to continu to receiv govern payment   commod price could fluctuat  though  becaus we continu to have a fair sever drought in the central and we n plain of our region  which is bring a lot of it own uncertainti in the agricultur product sector  let me turn to the nation scene   the broad contour of our econom outlook have chang littl sinc the last meet   we still expect near term weak and medium term strength   like the  book  we expect growth to be about     percent in the first half and then to increas to   percent as we move forward  recogn that the error band around that kind of forecast are fair larg   but the reason is   and i don   t think we should lose sight of it   that monetari polici is still s ul  fiscal polici is s ul and could becom more so  and we have financi market condit and a bank industri that are general abl to be support of an expans  the factor behind the near term weak remain the same as at our last meet   oil price and geopolit risk have fo  near term restraint   as these risk and uncertainti are lift   perhap in the next coupl of week or month but mayb even in the next few day   i think we   ll be abl to assess how these element of monetari polici and fiscal polici might play out in the real economi   at least by wait a littl longer we should also be allow more light in the room to see by as we think about polici   so my suggest would be in line with the vice chairman   s   name  that we might be well serv to wait and watch as more light is shed on the situat   it will put us in a better posit to make decis   as far as how we couch our polici decis  i believ we should be veri care about make ani chang   i think we will have an interest discuss in the polici portion of this meet about what we say in our press statement   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   as i suspect everybodi will note befor the morn is over  it has prove particular difficult to get our arm around what   s happen in the economi general   that   s certain the case more specif in our own district   the data and the anecdot evid are contradictori in some respect  and the messag regard the impact of geopolit uncertainti on corpor and consum decisionmak are not complet clear   for exampl  last week we met with our small busi  agricultur  and labor advisori council and the rhetor at best was somber  especi from the manufactur sector   even so  we had a florida architect in the group who said he was forc to turn away busi and recent had expand his staff   the head of a small account firm and a small engin firm report difficulti hire qualifi account and engin respect   a comput support and system supplier indic that busi was good and that he has recent been ad employe   and a pallet manufactur indic that demand had improv slight   the point is that how peopl were feel and the realiti of their busi activ didn   t alway match   of cours  there   s alway a danger in attempt to general from such anecdot  but our discuss in that group didn   t provid a clear indic of continu deterior in the economi  we specif ask our six board of director  which met last week and the week befor  to question their contact about three relat issu   the impact of geopolit uncertainti on hire and invest  the amount of excess capac that exist and how much demand would have to pick up befor hire and invest would resum  and what was happen in commerci real estat   the commerci real estat situat is the easiest to summar   activ remain dead in atlanta and mani of our other major citi   furthermor  it is slow or soften in those part of our district that had been do rather well last year  main south florida and louisiana   as for the capac issu  the firm that report to our director are say that demand would have to pick up between    and    percent befor hire and invest would resum and their busi would return to what they consid normal  final  it   s clear that uncertainti is weigh more and more heavili on short term invest decis   busi are also report a lack of profit combin with soft demand  both of which reflect a mix of fundament and fear that will have to be revers befor hire and invest acceler  i have sever quick final comment about our

singl famili market and in south florida even in the middl market segment   second  we recent receiv report of a further slowdown in tourism  especi for the cruis industri out of south florida   even though they   ve begun offer some signific fare discount   third  despit higher oil and gas price  the gulf of mexico is essenti a dead sea as far as drill and explor are concern  reflect uncertainti about the longer term prospect for energi price   fourth  higher fuel price are report have signific short term effect on cost in mani industri   one of our director  a truck execut  report on an industri studi that suggest that recent elev diesel fuel price  if they persist  would add about       billion in cost this year that will have to be absorb by shipper or their custom   final  higher natur gas price have led to the shutdown of sever chemic plant in the sixth district   my conclus from all this is that uncertainti is certain have some impact on the economi in our region  with activ a bit softer in some sector than i report at the last meet   but clear there are some sector   hous and health care to name a coupl   that continu to do just fine  sift out the effect of uncertainti from fundament is no easier at the nation level than at the district level   recent high frequenc data came in a bit weaker than i had hope  especi for labor market and the auto sector   but how much of this is due to uncertainti is not obvious to me   at the same  e  the sourc of strength in the economi remain reason sound   consum spend is be maintain  and hous continu at a high level  howev  increas concern are be express about both   moreov  invest activ and inventori accumul continu to lag   i   m not as op ist as the  book baselin forecast on the pickup in invest spend   the prolong invest slump scenario better captur my own view and would suggest a somewhat slower growth forecast   i realli don   t see where the impetus to substanti new invest will come from in the short run   despit the increas sign of weak  i continu to believ that substanti monetari s ulus remain in place   that s ulus remain signific the longer we hold rate below what market particip had initi expect   downward movement in long term interest rate indic that our polici s ulus continu to filter through the term structur   further  should even part of the administr   s fiscal s ulus packag be pass  it would give us still addit posit impetus to growth  have said all that  i believ we still face the same two question we ponder last  e  first  how much of the slowdown is due to fundament  and how much is due to uncertainti  second  would a further cut in rate have an impact on the fundament   sort out these issu is import becaus i start from the premis that an eas of monetari polici can   t substanti affect uncertainti or it sourc   moreov  the fundament problem i see in the economi right now are more structur in natur  and those are not like to be mitig by further rate cut  also  i   m not as comfort as i   d like to be with the way our model are captur the evolut of the fundament and their impact on the economi   my sens from talk to busi contact is that in realiti the fundament may not be as strong as the model forecast suggest   becaus of the way model are structur  they may not captur the full structur disloc that exist in the economi now and how they are be resolv   for exampl  our model may not fulli incorpor the level of debt held by both busi and consum and the impli fix nomin payment associ with those commit   further shock that hinder cash flow could generat more disloc and therebi slow the progress to profit  in addit  i believ that uncertainti is feed back into the economi  pose real cost that will have lag consequ even after the uncertainti is resolv   this is especi true in sever industri that were alreadi experienc structur adjust process   for exampl  the current run up in energi price is certain exacerb an alreadi difficult situat in the airlin  truck  and chemic industri   i find it hard to believ that even a quick resolut of the geopolit uncertainti will enabl mani of these firm to bounc back as quick as they might have done had they not been stress by the energi situat  to end where i began  it seem to me that the extraordinari uncertainti we face today make it veri difficult to get a good read on the under fundament of the economi and the realli import question as to the mix of cyclic and structur issu we   re deal with  while it is probabl fair to say that short term  downsid risk have increas somewhat  it   s not clear to me that this is the op   e for anoth polici eas  though that may eventu be appropri   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the seventh district has soften   mani of our contact indic that they saw some sign of improv begin around the turn of the year and extend into the first half of februari   howev  activ has deterior abrupt over the past few week   clear  consum and busi have becom increas cautious as intern tension have mount   but a number of our contact doubt that the economi will grow robust even after the situat in iraq is resolv   their concern seem to result from lacklust demand  excess capac  and rise oper cost in the context of littl or no price power   but when we press them  they often have not been abl to identifi ani root caus for the weak in demand other than the intern situat   this is somewhat similar to bill     s comment earlier  hous is the onli major sector in the district that still seem to be robust   consum spend has general remain weak   as we all know  light vehicl sale fell in februari  earli report in march suggest littl improv and  in the case of one of the big three  further weaken   automak and dealer told us that they were expect some sale volatil from month to month  but they clear were surpris by how soft sale were in late februari   the higher incent were not work for the first  e in quit a while  some portion of this decreas can be attribut to sever weather  which i   m happi to say did not find it way into the seventh feder reserv district   but mani report that they were see the influenc of heighten uncertainti  weak labor market  and higher fuel cost on consum demand   despit higher incent  light vehicl inventori have risen abov desir level  and firm are be forc to cut product in order to keep their inventori in line  outsid of auto  district manufactur has also slow sinc our last meet  with most busi continu to take a wait and see attitud   contact both insid and outsid manufactur have becom increas concern about rise input cost   sever of our director in chicago and detroit report that increas price for energi  properti and casualti insur  employe health care  and materi have boost product cost signific   the combin of flat to declin demand  signific higher cost  and fierc competit is pressur profit margin   in this environ  mani busi continu to delay hire   the phrase we keep hear is    hire paralysi      we   ve also heard report that a number of larg compani  in addit to the one that bob parri just mention  are plan anoth round of layoff   both   and manpow report that their year over year growth rate have trail off signific in recent month   one firm did see a pickup in temporari hire in area where militari reservist were call up  but the effect was small  turn to the nation outlook  the macroeconom pictur is even more uncertain than it was at our last meet   given the uncertainti about iraq in recent week  mani busi no doubt delay major spend decis   whi not wait anoth few week to see how event turn out   it   s like that such think contribut to the weak hire we saw in februari   as i note earlier  our contact say that activ has slow even more sinc the labor market refer week   in addit  although oil price have not yet reach extrem disrupt level  the prospect of further increas is an import downsid risk to the economi   as i mention earlier  mani of our contact say that demand is be held back by factor other than geopolit risk  and this rais the possibl that even if the situat in iraq is resolv quick  we could be in for a period of prolong sluggish   howev  at this point there is not much evid that the weak goe beyond iraq   although our contact are veri concern  they   ve offer few other specif rational for the continu sluggish   as   said  they   re have difficulti disentangl the reason for the weak   moreov  the foundat appear in place for a pickup in growth   for exampl  accommod monetari polici  lean inventori  and of cours strong product growth  accord  if the iraq situat is resolv quick  we expect to see activ acceler later this year  although growth for the year will still fall short of potenti   of cours  as point out in the  book simul  which i thought were excel  busi and household could respond in a varieti of way as geopolit event unfold   so i guess it would be an understat to say that the degre of near term uncertainti surround the outlook is unusu high
thank you  mr  chairman   what we hear repeat around the district are phrase such as    muddl along        on hold     and    wait and see      bank loan demand is flat  it   s veri difficult to know   i don   t think anybodi can tell   how much of what we   ve been observ is a consequ of war fear and how much of it reflect under uncertainti  i   ve been press my contact about their capit spend plan and in particular tri to find out if peopl are think ahead to the expir of the tax incent in septemb of next year  in general  peopl comment that they are not take that into account yet  and capit spend is flat   my up contact say that up capit expenditur are for repair or replac equip as necessari but there is no growth in the compani   s capit expenditur spend  howev  my fedex contact said that fedex   plan to buy truck veri aggress to take advantag of the invest incent   he expect that perhap   to   percent of fedex capit outlay in      will reflect spend be move from      into      to take advantag of those incent  i believ there is a way to think about the nation pictur that may be use   think back  for exampl  to the middl of last week when the  book was be put to bed  which was befor the thursday stock market ralli   let me put this in a veri overst  extrem way in order to make a point   if we view a lot of the data as reflect the mean of a fair wide distribut  then mayb there   s a    percent probabl of a realli good outcom   call that a      and a    percent probabl of a veri weak outcom  flat or someth like that   call that weak outcom a zero   the mean is    but in fact there   s not much probabl weight on   as the actual outcom  it   s spread out at these extrem  and that is a veri unusu situat   now  what we   ve seen just in the last few day is a quit substanti surg in equiti price  a drop in the price of oil  and a big increas in the valu of the dollar   a larg one day move ye day that is veri atyp   those develop may well indic that peopl are now put more weight on the outcom we call    and less weight on the outcom we call zero   if this way of think about the situat is use  it mean   given that in come week we will know more about whether the outcom is like to be closer to the    or the zero   that perhap the best cours for us at this point is not to tri to guess   if we guess wrong  the action we took base on that guess will not have been veri appropri   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   i would describ the district economi as stabl  and i do think that   s probabl the right term   there  sn   t seem to be ani appreci deterior at this point  but at the same  e there   s littl net growth   employ for the most part is flat  although at the far we n and ea n end of the district we do have somewhat more favor report   but those are relat thin popul area  with relat small economi   if one talk to our director and other busi peopl about their hire plan  fundament they don   t have ani  which is to say that they   re not intend to add to their employ level any  soon   there is still a lot of op  surround the hous sector  but i have the sens that in at least some of the larger market the builder now have gotten ahead of demand  and that will obvious have implic for activ as  e goe on  consum spend ex auto appear to be close to flat  and of cours  auto sale have been softer recent as reflect in the nation number  as far as the nation economi is concern  i would make sever mayb semi random point   first of all  the downward adjust to the  book forecast for real growth in the current and subsequ quarter look right to me   i think that   s consist with the tenor of the incom nation data and is certain congruent with the anecdot that i   ve been pick up as well   at the same  e i don   t have the sens that the longer term outlook in the  book has chang ani as we get to later this year and into        i also think that   s appropri   i haven   t chang my longer run view   to be sure  there   s a tremend amount of uncertainti   but those of us who   ve been at this for a while also know that there   s a great tendenc toward get whipsaw if one put a lot of emphasi on the last observ or two and not so much on the evid regard under fundament   i think the fundament underpin the longer run outlook  which look pretti favor to me  are still in place   i won   t go through the entir litani  but i will point to the product number that some peopl have alreadi cite and to the continu growth in dispos incom  i do believ  and this is the view in the  book as well  that employ is go to be slow to pick up   we saw that follow the         recess   but my reason for expect that is not just histor preced   for busi there   s a lot of pressur on the top line and on the bottom line   in that environ  ad to employ is just not a chang that   s go to come veri quick   further  i do suspect that the near term risk to the economi are probabl on the downsid   that   s a suspicion  not realli a convict   but whether it   s right or not  i think we   re alreadi posit for that possibl   polici has react  and interest rate are clear low   i   m not sure that we   ll necessarili get a great deal of clarif regard the outlook even if the conflict with iraq goe veri well   i   d like to think we would   but there are a lot of other problem around the world  some of which could even be exacerb depend on how the situat in iraq play out   final  in my view this is the  e to avoid over guess and act as if we know more than we do   there   s a tremend amount of uncertainti  and it   s probabl go to pay to be patient and cautious and see how thing unfold
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  growth in econom activ in the third district has falter   at least part of this is due to uncertainti over the  e  durat  and magnitud of the war  as mani other have said   it   s like that when this uncertainti is resolv we   ll see stronger growth  but our survey evid suggest that econom activ might not necessarili rebound quick after militari action in iraq  manufactur in our area has turn down over the last two month   the general activ index of our busi outlook survey fell from     in februari to minus   in our march survey to be releas on thursday   that is the lowest read sinc decemb        new order also declin in march  and shipment were flat  a special question in our februari survey provid some evid on how soon econom activ might rebound after geopolit uncertainti is resolv   we ask our survey respond to tell us whether their hire and spend plan this year were advers affect by geopolit uncertainti  weak demand  or someth els   respond could choos more than one factor   about    percent of respond said that geopolit uncertainti were affect their hire and spend plan this year  but near    percent said that lack of demand was have an effect   of cours  the caus of the lack of demand may well be geopolit risk  it   s difficult to separ the two   nonetheless  this seem to indic concern about the state of the economi that may go beyond the effect of the current gulf conflict   firm in our survey did not appear to be pois to resum spend upon the resolut of geopolit uncertainti   onli    percent plan to begin hire and   percent plan to resum invest as soon as uncertainti is resolv   but over    percent plan to wait at least six month or have no plan to increas hire or capit spend upon resolut of uncertainti   respons to the special question indic that  relat to their plan at the start of the year  about a third of the firm have delay ad worker to their payrol   almost one half of the firm have delay increas their capit spend   these result are consist with most forecast  which expect growth to remain subdu until the second half of the year  activ in other sector of the region economi has also eas sinc our last meet  consum spend has slow  auto sale and retail sale of general merchandis declin in februari   the snowstorm undoubt had an impact on this   i wish the snow had gone to chicago  but that   s anoth stori
nevertheless  our retail tell us that  even befor the storm  sale momentum was slow   store traffic has been down sinc januari  and merchant general indic that consum are limit discretionari purchas except for home relat good  commerci and residenti construct activ has eas  although demand for home has continu strong   quot rate for commerci space have been fair stabl in recent month  but effect rate have fallen   in addit  to attract tenant  landlord are now will to leas space for a shorter durat   while the outlook of those in the region   s busi communiti remain posit  no one is expect a strong rebound   this is similar to the view express by our busi contact at the last meet   howev  my sens is that the tone has turn more negat   perhap this reflect mere the proxim of militari action  perhap it reflect the realiz that we haven   t seen much posit momentum and that certain sector  in particular manufactur  have deterior  similar to the district  the nation econom recoveri has been held back becaus of concern about geopolit uncertainti and most recent becaus of bad weather   how larg the effect is of these special factor is difficult to determin   the data we   ve receiv sinc our last meet have been on the weak side   even exclud the special factor of the snowstorm and the call up of reservist  the februari employ report was much weaker than expect  with sizabl and widespread job loss   it is too soon to determin whether the increas in capit spend order we saw in januari will portend the begin of a period of stronger econom growth   given the continu level of excess capac  it would be hard to conclud that capit spend this year will be stronger than the moder rate shown in the forecast  there are indic that the growth of consum spend is begin to slow   this might reflect the event involv iraq  but it also might reflect concern over job prospect  at this point  it might be use for us to recogn again the differ between risk and uncertainti   with risk  as we know  one can assign probabl to the list of outcom and act appropri given the distribut   with uncertainti  it is difficult to assign probabl to outcom   moreov  it is difficult even to describ all the possibl outcom themselv  general firm and consum have develop way of handl risk   uncertainti is much harder to cope with   it tend to paralyz decisionmak   today we are oper in a world of increas uncertainti   the result has been the postpon of mani econom decis   and by extens the econom recoveri   a short live and success war in iraq will resolv some of the uncertainti   not all of it  though  sinc win the peac will be much tougher than win the war and there are other problem  as we have note around this tabl today   we won   t have much new data on the real side  given the lag in the data   but we will have oil price and financi market as indic to look at  as well as anecdot evid we glean from our busi contact   from these we should be abl to tell relat quick whether a resolut of geopolit uncertainti will result in new vital for our real economi or at least if it was the main drag delay the recoveri  thus  my read of the data suggest that the econom recoveri has slow somewhat sinc our last meet   but until there   s some resolut of uncertainti  i believ there is littl reason to expect that a chang in our alreadi accommod polici stanc would have much effect   it might not even be notic in the present circumst   our futur path should be clearer onc some of the uncertainti surround the natur of militari action in iraq are resolv   at that point  the committe may wish to act   we need not wait until our next regular schedul meet in may   but at this  e  in my judgment  ani action would be prematur   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   for the last coupl of meet i   ve temper my remark about the new england economi with refer to a light at the end of the tunnel  howev dim   this had been seen in confid indic  in a lead index of the massachusett economi  and in mani anecdot refer   i hesit to say that the light has gone out  but the most signific chang in new england between this meet and the last one is that nobodi talk about that light anymor  the data suggest that recoveri may be further away than had been expect   mani area of the new england economi either weaken recent or are show no sign of growth  month to month job loss acceler in decemb  and benchmark revis to employ data that will be releas later this month are like to move employ total down further  massachusett has been lose job steadili while other state are resum a downward trend  moreov  long term unemploy is an increas problem   a recent analysi tell us that  in our region  the number unemploy for over six month was about five  e greater in      than in       that number doubl for the nation as a whole   consum confid track the move downward that was evid in the nation data   busi confid  which had seen small increas in late      and in januari  drop in februari to level last seen in late       futur condit data drop below     indic that survey respond no longer forese posit condit within six month   similar  an index of lead indic prepar by univers of massachusett economist   which had been predict some growth by midyear   turn negat  suggest that the massachusett economi will shrink about   percent rather than grow   final  confid among new england technolog execut plummet in the last quarter of       as report by a local survey   these execut had experienc some growth in their busi earli in the year  but prospect dim by year end  particular in the telecommun and softwar sector   commerci real estat market appar soften even further around the turn of the year   offic vacanc rose both in downtown boston and in the suburb  but we   re told that report vacanc data appar do not even come close to captur the extent of avail space   observ say that  even in the slowdown of the late     s and earli     s  the boston market did not experi two year back to back of negat absorpt   contact now predict that      will be the third consecut year that has occur  we spent some  e tri to sort out what is perhap the unsort   whether geopolit uncertainti or under econom fundament are the caus of the ever softer patch in new england   s econom activ   not surpris  this is realli hard to determin  our beig book  advisori council  and other contact note that geopolit uncertainti is clear have some effect but that it   s hard to quantifi   the one channel that seem most clear affect was consum behavior   but most contact also argu that  while the militari situat in iraq and other geopolit concern were an issu at the margin  the economi would not be show solid growth even in the absenc of war   other factor  such as excess capac in a varieti of industri and a murki pictur for the high tech sector  have contribut strong to econom weak   furthermor  while one would expect that war relat spend in militari intens new england might have a posit effect  no signific effect has yet been report  the comment was made that  if your busi was not involv in the mobil effort  the effect of militari spend was actual negat in that step were be taken to offset mobil cost wherev possibl  final  i can   t leav the subject of new england without some mention of the deepen state fiscal crise  especi in massachusett and main   the drop in employ and a bleak outlook for mani busi suggest that cut now project by the state to achiev fiscal balanc may not be suffici and that their effect may reverber on the region economi  inde  a month ago we thought massachusett tax revenu was like to grow at just under   percent in fiscal       which match the project of the new state administr   it now appear that a scenario of no revenu increas has a greater probabl   one area of the state   s economi that so far has not experienc much of a downturn is the health care sector  which account for    to    percent of the local economi   that could chang   further cut in state fund for medicaid and the relat loss of feder match fund would elimin the posit margin hospit overal have been experienc and would send a number of institut into negat territori   obvious  this will come back to haunt in the form of higher medic insur cost alreadi note as a serious concern by region busi  larg and small  on the nation scene  incom data most recent have been disappoint   labor market condit seem to have deterior   consum spend on hous has held up  but spend in other area   on auto in particular   is lacklust   one of our director has a compani that is involv in provid audio equip for high end car   throughout most of the      period he has seen resili in his forecast three and six month out   obvious  he has to get forecast direct from the automak   in februari that resili came to an end  and the forecast look forward drop signific   his experi over thirti year or so in the industri suggest that this is a uniqu break with the past  and it portend quit a bit of soft go forward in project of auto sale   of cours  it   s hard to separ the effect of the mobil of reservist and the blizzard that occur in the new england area  and all down the east coast as well  on the critic presid    day weekend   but overal  the data are not particular encourag in my view   of cours the real question face us now is not what is happen current  becaus it   s hard to sort that out  but what is like to happen over the rest of the year   in some way that is even harder to disentangl  i have to say  as i said earlier  that i think the baselin forecast in the  book is about as op ist a case as can be made   in that forecast the war is short and relat cheap  uncertainti about geopolit event drop mark  take with it much of the econom restraint we   re current experienc   consum spend and residenti invest rebound solid   oil price drop rapid through the year   product is well maintain   key part of the administr   s tax packag are pass   interest rate remain low   equiti market show steadi posit improv  and by year end  busi profit and invest spend are on track for doubl digit growth in        frank  i think the risk to this forecast have to lie on the downsid  the degre to which both busi spend and consum spend rebound in the last half of this year is debat  and i think it   s debat not just becaus of oil price   i do wonder about the effect of develop in venezuela and nigeria and about the excess capac or lack thereof in saudi arabia and other place around the gulf   i wonder whether oil price will drop as fast as they do in the forecast and stay low   is that expect realiz   with regard to auto sale  the project in the  book seem particular robust  go from the current pace of      million to    million to    million plus in the second half of the year   moreov  it   s by no mean clear that the administr   s tax plan will be pass in ani form   final  the strength of hous in the forecast is remark as well   the project of   million start by earli      suggest a hous boom compar to that in the earli to mid     s  when arguabl the demograph were quit differ  lot of thing have to go realli well in a veri short  e for the  book forecast to be realiz   inde  it   s more op ist about both growth and inflat   particular by         than most other forecast  includ our own in boston  for whatev that   s worth   clear the  book staff  outsid forecast  and we in boston face a greater than normal degre of uncertainti   but i   m uncomfort with a baselin that seem to resolv most question on the op ist side   even if we were to take the  book forecast as the most like outcom  where   that leav us as we move from      to        the  book is explicit about this  excess capac persist with the unemploy rate at     percent and output about   percentag point below potenti   the onli altern scenario that chang that pictur involv a    basi point reduct in rate  what should we do about this   high level of uncertainti clear call for caution   it is arguabl that an eas in polici right now won   t affect busi invest and that the declin in ten year treasuri yield  if sustain for ani  e  should act to keep the residenti and mortgag refinanc market aliv   howev  given the uncertainti   and i would argu the longer term undesir   of addit fiscal polici s ulus  monetari polici is the onli tool left to support an economi that may face fundament problem   the conserv  prudent central banker in me agre with vice chair   that  given current level of uncertainti and the immin war  the right thing to do may be to say littl  stay put  and keep our powder dri   but i am concern about how long it realli will be prudent to continu in this postur
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m not sure i can follow that gloomi assess and allevi it veri much   like other around the tabl  i   ve focus on our struggl to sort out the restrain near term effect of the war concern from the more fundament factor affect of the economi   unfortun  the pictur becam even murkier over the intermeet period   i do think we need to rememb that the januari data on consumpt and especi on invest rais hope that the anticip strengthen in demand was under way befor the economi seem to hit a wall in februari   we are deal with what is fortun a most unusu  extraordinari situat   with the countri on the brink of a long anticip war   what is also unusu is that this war could be deflationari rather than inflationari as the vast major of the war through histori have been   that   s becaus the usual pressur on resourc from fight the war could be outweigh by the negat effect on privat demand of a disrupt to oil suppli and of heighten uncertainti   but it may well be that the maximum deflationari impact is occur in the lead up to the war rather than the war itself   it   s in the anticip stage that uncertainti is greatest and that market price in some odd on major oil field disrupt   sure  these sort of consider along with some veri nasti weather  at least along the east coast   it   s alway nasti in chicago    laughter
i don   t think i   m go to mention the weather again
you folk in chicago wouldn   t even have notic it if you had had this storm   season adjust  it   s alway spring in chicago   veri nasti weather along the east coast had a major effect on the data for employ  product  and sale in februari   the rise in energi price sinc late last year  reflect in gasolin and home heat expens  undoubt sap consum spend direct   moreov  the higher gasolin price and uncertainti about futur gasolin price may have play a role in weaken auto sale  especi if that uncertainti caus peopl to postpon decis  governor bernank note at the last meet that  the closer the event with uncertain outcom  the higher the hurdl rate for invest   it   s not surpris that mani differ kind of busi commit   hire as well as spend on capit good   were push back   it strike me that today   s hous data may suggest that decis on home purchas and hous invest could be affect as well by the heighten uncertainti   certain this uncertainti is reflect in equiti market  where the equiti premium   a key element in what is in effect a hurdl rate for buy the exist capit stock   has risen sharpli   undoubt as uncertainti abat  the market will improv   as we   ve alreadi seen in the last few day   and this improv will allow stronger fundament to show through  nonetheless  we don   t know how strong the fundament are   we can   t complet dismiss the possibl that the februari data were also signal a less robust strengthen in demand than we had anticip   that   s certain the way the credit market seem to interpret the new inform  especi the februari employ report   interest rate were mark down across the yield curv  with declin in forward rate in the five to seven year rang account for the largest decreas   a portion of the earlier drop in equiti price seem to reflect not onli higher equiti premium but downward revis to earn and revenu forecast  which were probabl onli tangenti relat to war fear  at this point  howev  it is simpli not possibl to sort out the relat strength of the various influenc on the economi or financi market   the staff base it forecast on the current structur of price and rate and financi market becaus it was the onli sensibl default mode   the lower equiti price  in particular  play a role in weaken the forecast a touch   but those price and rate  as dave point out  reflect the mean of some veri skew and strang dispers distribut   all we know for sure is that  as the situat unfold and various outcom get more or less probabl weight  those price and rate will chang   and possibl by quit a lot as we   ve seen in the last few day   moreov  a good part of that unfold will occur relat soon  and a reason presumpt is that the forecast will chang too  perhap signific  person  i suspect that our next action is more like to be an eas than a tighten  i base that on the possibl that at least a littl of the februari weak reflect continu under soft and broader busi uncertainti and on the possibl that geopolit risk could continu to weigh on oil price  sen ent  and spend for a while   i combin these possibl  howev small  with the notion that at this stage of the econom cycl   with a sizabl output gap and low and declin inflat   the consequ from inadvert have polici a littl too tight would be far more advers than the consequ from have it a littl too easi   but i don   t have ani real convict about the next polici action   we   ll have more inform about unfold event and their potenti effect soon   over the near term  much of that inform will come from reaction in financi and oil market  as under trend in spend will onli slowli reveal themselv   these market will be noisi   undoubt they   ll overreact  driven by hope and fear as much as by a clear eye read of the cours of the economi  so extract the import signal could be difficult   but given my lack of convict about the futur and my sens that market signal will be import and over  e help  i think the feder reserv should not be tri to steer market at this point   like mani other who have alreadi comment  i think it   s  e to admit our ignor  get out of the way  and let event and their reaction unfold   thank you  mr  chairman
with that we shall adjourn for coffe   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   not much new and signific is go on in the eleventh district economi   person incom is grow but not fast enough to rais live standard   employ final is grow again but at rate so anem that it feel like contract   other indic have cross the threshold into expans but not by much   i would like to be abl to conclud that the data signifi the end of the downturn in our region and might even be the start of a recoveri  but i   m not convinc   last friday and saturday i met with the fine peopl from the louisiana banker associ  and just befor that i met with our board of director and our advisori council on small busi and agricultur   the view express in the latter two group were consider more negat than the last  e they met  the mood of both meet can be summar by the open remark of one of my director  to wit     with recoveri like this  who need recess     singl famili hous has been hold up  particular at the lower and moder price point   one director felt that mortgag rate could rise by a percentag point or so  mayb even   point  from the current veri low level without have a strong negat effect on hous demand   in her word     mortgag rate provid the nicotin to the hous industri  but job growth is the real sourc of nutrit      her point was that without some improv in job growth  the effect of lower interest rate like will wear off  on the high tech side  our director from a major semiconductor manufactur indic that the order to shipment ratio in the chip industri had final risen abov   for the first  e in two year   recoveri has now hit everi sector of the industri except wire telecom  but of all the market they serv  the unit state is the weakest   those in the industri are wait on the sidelin until they can get a better handl on market demand   in the mean   price are under extrem downward pressur   she   s look for singl digit growth in the next year or two   with no increas in capit spend and therefor no pickup in suppli  she hope that some increas price power will be restor in late       we had sever report from director who were quit knowledg about the energi busi   there was some discuss about how much of a war premium is built into current oil price   the uncertainti on the premium involv question in at least two area   first  is there realli surplus capac in the middl east   it has never been test   second  how much infrastructur damag will be done in iraq   one director note that oil infrastructur is fair hard to destroy   the big question rais by a coupl of director was venezuela  a countri that was character as be on the brink of disintegr into civil war or anarchi   venezuelan oil has a big impact on u s  gasolin price   the govern has fire half the oil compani   s middl manag and replac them with croni and militari peopl report to be not too compet when it come to the basic logist of move oil to market   signific gasolin shortag alreadi exist within venezuela  and it   s like that oil product is run at less than half the claim rate   both the countri and it oil product could be on the verg of total breakdown   around houston the talk is begin to be about a return to     a barrel for oil after iraq is settl rather than the     price that had been anticip a coupl of month ago  concern were also express about natur gas   if price were to remain in the area of    it would suggest that we have a shortag border on scarciti   if busi come to believ that gas price will remain at those elev level  they will shut their plant and sell the gas they   ve contract for   our petrochem plant are age facil that were built on the basi of      gas not    plus gas   these plant could shut down  and their output could go oversea  the tone of our small busi council was similar downbeat   i got the distinct impress that mani of these busi peopl and their peer are just bare hang in there  also  there seem to be a lot of disguis unemploy and underemploy   two of the small busi repres on our council indic that current condit are the worst they have ever seen  and both of them have been in busi in the dalla area for over thirti year  when we press them on whether thing were realli wors than dure the texa depress in the late     s they both without hesit said    yes      they live through those tough  e  yet they feel that today   s fundament are wors   i hope this view is a function of hazi memori  i   ve seen that befor when the economi is go through the destruct phase of creativ destruct and when it   s too soon to discern the creativ part  turn to the nation economi  i must say that  given the econom and non econom uncertainti we face  the staff baselin forecast seem plausibl in it broad contour   i especi appreci the choic of altern simul   i count myself to be among those who believ that the disinfl forc of the last decad will continu to prevail over the forc act to push up the rate of inflat   as a result  i found myself drawn toward the  book simul involv a lower fund rate or the adopt of a market base fund rate   while be drawn in that direct  i   m not readi to support a reduct in the fed fund rate at this meet   given all the fog and the dust out there and the sand be stir up by the threat of war  the public and the market would have difficulti interpret ani chang in our polici stanc at this  e   while i believ that the downsid risk prevail  this is probabl not a good  e to tri to do anyth about it
thank you  mr  chairman   after start the year off strong  the economi seem to have taken anoth stumbl in februari   the list of disappoint econom report sinc our last meet is long   the job report  consum confid  retail sale  auto product  industri product  earn forecast  state and local budget  and now hous start   the  book author have taken    point off the growth forecast for both the first and second halv of the year   blue chip forecast also have been lower   foreign growth has been written down   of cours  the uncertainti about the militari situat is or could be at the root of all of this   forecast these day seem to hing on a few critic exogen assumpt  with everyth els be endogen   in today   s situat  for exampl  i can imagin two vast differ scenario all start from one or two chang assumpt  one i   ll call the         scenario after the  book and  span    laughter   i   m go to replay cathi   s comment a bit here but a littl mute   lift away the militari uncertainti  the  book base case is actual rather op ist   oil price are high now but drop down in that forecast in line with futur market   the stock market is at least in neutral  fiscal polici is veri expansionari   consumpt is reason strong with save rate stay low to normal   high tech invest is alreadi slate to grow in the first half of the year  and the rest of invest soon follow   the output gap rise for a while and then start drop pretti sharpli   if one splice onto this a more ebulli stock market  which we may alreadi have seen some of  it   s easi to imagin a fair bullish scenario   one in which further polici action is probabl not requir and  inde  may even have to be revers at some point  at the same  e  i can chang one or two assumpt and get an altogeth differ scenario   oil price in fact don   t come down  perhap becaus of the damag to the oil well in iraq combin with venezuela not return to full product and the appar low level of inventori   natur gas price stay high and keep electr price high   for whatev reason  the stock market stumbl yet again  and wealth valu don   t recov   save rate rise more than forecast  and the lessen acceler effect limit the growth of invest in the context of continu capit overhang   budget deficit soar  and fiscal expans is limit   the dollar fall and hurt the economi of europ  latin america  and japan without do our much good   monetari polici maker in these other countri are hamstrung either by real constraint or imagin constraint  the differ between these two scenario are not all that larg   hing on a few exogen assumpt about oil price  stock price  and confid in general   at this point we realli can   t forecast these critic magnitud veri well  and it make sens to sit on the sidelin for a while   it is quit possibl that the critic magnitud will becom much clearer in a short  e and we will be in a better posit to act   but as dave   suggest  it   s also quit possibl that the critic magnitud will not clear up veri rapid and we will have to go back to make polici under extrem uncertainti   the best approach then may not be to wait until all signific uncertainti have clarifi  but i leav those puzzl until anoth day  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the fourth district appear to be broad consist with those in the rest of the nation   two sentenc in the beig book nation summari describ our situat veri well   name that growth in econom activ remain subdu in januari and februari and that geopolit and econom uncertainti are constrain busi and consum spend and temper near term expect   i think the staff did an excel job in report  analyz  and synthes the data that have come in sinc our last meet   the staff conclud that the economi is like to be weaker in the near term  yet real gdp growth and inflat next year are expect to be about the same as was forecast at our last meet  indic the larg transient natur of the addit soft   i general agre with that forecast  although how i arriv at the gdp figur is slight differ  i   d like to focus my comment this morn on some of this near term weak and it potenti implic   first  the march   releas of the februari labor market data   seem to have power affect market sen ent about the economi   all of us are awar that last month   s weather distort econom activ  and our beig book contact across a wide rang of retail sector report that the winter storm did affect their sale   even if we knew how to account for the weather  we probabl still would conclud that labor market weaken in februari   but it   s hard to know how much of that report is idiosyncrat  as can often happen with one month   s data  one of my director  whose firm suppli materi nation to the homebuild market  report that she saw a signific decreas in order in februari   but as rapid as order had declin in februari  they bounc back in earli march   overal i don   t get a sens from our director or advisori council member and other contact in the district that condit have chang fundament in the past few month   but  like presid santomero  i detect a signific more negat tone in their comment  the economi is still expand  and it is expect to do so  albeit at a veri moder pace   hous has continu to be strong  and the banker in my district say that it   s go to continu to be strong   busi invest is weak  and it is expect to remain weak accord to busi peopl in my district   i   ve had mani convers with contact throughout the district about how credit avail  the geopolit risk  and capac util are affect the pace of their capit spend   banker report that they are veri liquid and anxious to lend  in fact  they note in a more short term perspect that they final have start to receiv inquiri from their busi custom   custom have increas their credit line but are not use those line  which tell me at least that they   re gear up for some use of them down the road but not until the iraq situat is resolv   within the last week alon  two of my busi contact inform me that their firm had turn away sizabl order becaus to fill those order they would have to add to capac and  with the uncertainti that we face  they weren   t will to do that   in ordinari  e  those invest would have been made  so  as i comment at the last meet  i still am concern about the outlook for a snapback in bfi given the current low level of capac util   our research depart did some statist work to examin the relationship between capac util and busi fix invest   we found that both the level and the chang in capac util strong lead busi invest  again suggest that we shouldn   t expect a pickup in bfi until some of the excess capac get absorb   from our beig book contact we hear a consist stori  name that they are not will to add to their capac   mani of them still have a lot of idl capac and aren   t plan ani addit capit spend even to bring that idl capac back on line   this   not mean that we won   t see ani spend on plant and equip or softwar but rather that the upward trajectori is not go to be as steep as we   d like to see   interest  i think the caution about capit spend fit into the  book project of strong product growth   i say that becaus the ceo i talk to are tell me that  even though they are pay veri close attent to payrol and to capit spend   they   re not hire and they   re not spend   they are still innov   these effort show up in the healthi rate of multifactor product growth as we see in the  book  in summari  i am discourag by the lack of progress in the expans thus far  but i believ that some of it is clear due to the unsettl risk of war and terror   obvious  the potenti for war is a veri dark cloud overhead   and not that far overhead perhap   although this cloud is restrain econom activ now  i do believ that it success dissolut will result in a continu econom expans   so as the vice chair and other have indic today  this is a  e for the central bank to be patient  to watch develop unfold  and especi to see how the economi look onc this dark cloud of uncertainti dissip   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc the last meet we have wit a strike exampl of the differ between risk and uncertainti  with the latter be an import factor in the privat sector   s econom decisionmak   the economi appear to have pick up it pace of growth in januari and then suffer a setback by flatten a bit in februari   the toll of uncertainti on consum show through in drop in confid and also in a slow of consum purchas of big ticket item   busi mirror consum by slow their order of new equip  cut product  and delay hire   final  financi market particip appear to be high uncertain about futur stock return and are high avers to that uncertainti   these factor evidenc themselv in a declin in stock price that drove the equiti risk premium to the highest level in more than a decad while  at the same  e  purchas of corpor bond drove yield spread on those asset down further   these financi market develop are most unusu in my eye in that they reflect a fundament tension and inconsist in risk appetit across asset pool that look to the same sourc of earn   corpor earn   for the under cash flow to support asset valuat  now  as we all know  this uncertainti broke a bit last week and a littl more with the presid   s speech ye day   what we   ve seen then is that stock price soar  the dollar ralli  govern bond price fell  and oil and gold price slid   as a central bank  presum we should put a great deal of weight on financi market and commod market input   but in this case one can onli hope that the op  about a benign outcom to both the war and the peac that   s embodi in these chang in asset price becom a realiti  when put in an intern context  as dino point out earlier this morn  it is clear that financi market particip still seem to see the u s  economi as   if i can say it this way   one of the least ugli economi on the horizon   perhap they   re look to our longer term fundament  which i would say are basic sound   fiscal polici is alreadi accommod  monetari polici is by mani measur still support of growth  the dollar has weaken a bit on net  and product continu to increas   becaus of the uncertainti we have wit  it is difficult if not imposs to get a firm view of the forc drive recent econom develop   it is true that we were shock not just by geopolit concern  which mount steadili  but also by sever weather  which play through to higher gasolin and heat oil price   howev  some of the weak may also reflect more fundament difficulti that the economi is have in recov from the recess   the  book reflect the forecast   s dilemma by present what is describ as a    mean    forecast  therebi i think put equal weight on a rang of possibl outcom   i do not see this as a cop out at all but rather an honest reflect of the fact that nobodi can declar with certainti which forc  either transitori or more fundament  will shape the intermedi term   as other have alreadi indic  in these circumst a prudent central bank certainti want to do no harm   that is best accomplish  i believ  by reflect honest the imponder that the immedi futur hold and also by wait for greater clariti to return   thank you
in talk with banker within the last week or so  i think the vantag point of two in particular were of interest   one indic that at his bank  one of the largest consum lender in the countri  the volum and credit qualiti they have been experienc recent is consist with upward pressur on price and yet they don   t sens ani price pressur   the fact that they are a major credit card issuer and have a signific rang of consum loan product has histor given them a window through which they have been abl to predict retail sale quit well  and that was the vantag point he was talk about   in contrast  on the commerci loan side he had two observ   one is that there is noth in the pipelin  but two  which is of consider interest  is that the credit qualiti of their loan portfolio has improv   if you follow the call report data  you would know that credit qualiti even on commerci portfolio had been declin up through the end of last year  but in this banker   s judgment  it has level out and mayb even improv   so we see the contrast effect of bank have experienc improv credit qualiti yet no loan demand  which may in fact corrobor governor bernank   s thesi that the closer we get to the event  the higher the hurdl rate  the second report is from a bank that is a major commerci lender and also a major secur servic   that bank had exact the same experi with respect to the commerci loan portfolio but also had what it describ as paralysi with respect to equiti activ   no cross border activ and no ipo   the underwrit tend to be come primarili from the municip sector   the descript we   ve heard this morn is of an atmospher of uncertainti  some portion of which is geopolit  this banker would character it somewhat differ  he would describ it as paralysi of which the domin reason is geopolit risk  recogn that there may well be other risk also  one other note of caution from my contact is that bank are now recogn and start to feel how expens liquid can be   as a result  we   re see evid of bank reach for yield   there has been a firm of the secondari market for commerci loan  for exampl  and new interest in the b tranch of collater loan oblig  clos    we also see bank reach out on the term of their loan and invest to achiev higher rate of return  someth dino suggest was occur and that i think presid pianalto hint at as well   all in all  it is certain a  e of great uncertainti and therefor  as presid guynn and other have said  perhap not a circumst that can most direct be address through monetari polici
i also want to talk a littl about the financi sector  includ bank  and contrast that with what we see happen in the real sector   the bluebook point out that commerci bank in the unit state had record earn in        and they had record earn in        we had back to back year of record earn in the commerci bank system dure a recess period and a relat slow recoveri   a period when interest rate have hit forti year low and one character by unusu liquid circumst as fund came back into the bank system   i think one of the thing we   re find is that  while it is difficult to oper in an environ of uncertainti  bank realli have learn to manag risk well   the asset   liabil manag process that bank initi in the     s and fine tune in the     s clear show that they can go through a major interest rate cycl and as a whole improv their earn   net interest margin in fact actual widen last year  on the credit side  we also saw bank manag credit veri well   if we look at the      number  the loan loss provis as a percentag of the return on asset was basic flat compar with the previous year   so again  bank are do a much better job at manag credit risk    what is also remark about these bank earn is that they were achiev through a record return on asset   it wasn   t done through financi leverag   bank in fact deleverag last year  so it wasn   t a record year for return on equiti   bank achiev record earn through stronger fundament as well as better risk manag  if we look at the broader financi market  especi sinc our last meet  we see that some of the volatil and excess credit spread we   ve observ in the last year or so have continu to improv   as was mention earlier  while debt spread are wider than histor  the spread have move in   much like what we   re hear from bank credit offic  the credit market folk are also say that to some extent the uncertainti part of the debt spread has been remov   what upset everybodi at the end of      and      was that prime credit were go immedi to bankruptci and that was happen becaus of what i love to call    oper risk      credit was not the real issu   these bankruptci were due to account scandal and manag fraud   compani that deterior over  e  like k mart  were handl in the tradit way   but it was the uncertainti about what was go on with regard to these other factor that contribut to the widen of debt spread in the invest grade market   that seem to be come down now  sinc we haven   t had ani materi event of that type in the last sever month  compani are restructur   we know they   ve lengthen from commerci paper to longer term debt   their corpor cash flow has also been improv  unfortun in part becaus they are not make capit invest   consum continu to refin and restructur their debt   the staff has shown us that household debt servic is actual down from where it was a coupl of year ago   so household financ are in good shape   if the bank sector  corpor balanc sheet  household financ  and debt market are stronger   and equiti market we know at least have shift to neutral   what realli is happen   again we get a    disconnect    between the improv of the financi sector and the weak in the real sector  after our fomc meet in januari i was op ist  as the news continu to be veri  veri strong   then as the februari data came out  as mani of you have remark alreadi  sudden we began to question what was happen   was it the snowstorm   after all  even an old southern like myself actual had to go out and buy a pair of boot   i thought that would have help the retail sale in februari  but it didn   t   high heat oil and natur gas cost also took a toll on peopl   s spend   but as we   ve talk about  the uncertainti regard what is go on in iraq and mayb other countri appear to be prey both on consum and busi   becaus it is veri hard to evalu risk and to make decis in a period of high uncertainti  the decisionmak that affect real econom activ and creat job and growth in our resourc has slow to almost a halt   so until we realli know more about the situat in iraq  i   m not sure what we can do to deal with the uncertainti through monetari polici   the concern involv not onli the war but also  as mani of you have mention alreadi  the aftermath of the war   unlik the situat in kuwait  we are not go to be reinstal the govern  we have to help creat a successor govern   therefor  i think the uncertainti is go to continu for some  e   becaus of the natur of the uncertainti  i   m uncomfort make ani chang right now in the direct of polici   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani have note  we   re current in a period of maximum uncertainti  with the result that the economi is almost in a state of suspend anim   until the world situat clarifi  the hurdl rate for invest or ani major commit will be veri high  as some of my colleagu have note   by the same token  ani action we would take on rate today would be larg inframargin  i continu to believ that the economi has substanti fundament and financi strength   there is also a lot of accumul slack in the economi becaus we   ve had essenti no employ gain for about two year   therefor  i think there   s a good chanc that a reason success resolut of the iraqi situat will lead to strong growth in the second half of this year and in        but in defer to presid    i also agre that some altern  more negat scenario are possibl   here are two  the first is what i call the    fear of fear itself    scenario   continu pessim   there might be a less than satisfactori outcom to the war or continu fear of terror  in which case consum confid and self confirm doubt might lead to slow growth in invest and consum spend   i think that   s a real possibl and one that we need to keep in mind  a second possibl  which is perhap complementari to that  would be a weak profit scenario   firm could find that their intern market are veri weak  and they could continu to suffer from high energi cost and high cost for insur and pension   that combin with structur issu in a number of major industri and perhap a lack of technolog opportun   or opportun that are less good than hope for   might result in profit that are not strong   that in turn would lead to weaker stock market valuat and less invest than we   re hope for   so those are two possibl scenario   given the amount of slack in the economi  i think either of those situat  if they were to materi  would be amen to continu s ul from both monetari and fiscal polici  let me say a word about  e   over the intermeet period there is  of cours  the possibl that the current veri high level of uncertainti will be resolv one way or the other  on the one hand  we could get veri good result in iraq with strong financi market reaction  a boost in consum confid  strong anecdot report  and so on   that would support the case for wait and watch with the hope that the strong recoveri would commenc   on the other hand  we might get the other tail of the distribut of possibl outcom   bad result in iraq and much concern at home  and negat financi market respons to that   but i want to echo what     and sever other have point out   name that there is a larg middl area of the distribut that we might be face at the next meet   there may still be consider uncertainti about the state of the economi go forward and whether or not the scenario in the  book will in fact be realiz   i would like to caution against the situat where we are continu wait for uncertainti to be resolv befor take action   that situat could go on indefinit   if the economi is still struggl and if there is no signific improv or evid of increas strength by our next meet  i hope we will at least consid the case for eas polici at that  e   thank you
thank you veri much   mr  reinhart
mr  chairman    will be distribut some materi that i   ll be refer to   with event move quick  i thought it best to start with the snapshot in exhibit   of market particip    current think about the decis you will announc this afternoon   as shown in the top panel  at ten o   clock this morn the april feder fund rate futur contract trade   basi point below the current    percent intend level  consist with a one in three chanc of a quarter point eas   survey respons collect friday  the middl left panel  indic that the major of investor believ that you will depict the balanc of risk as tilt toward econom weak  a shift in sen ent  the middl right panel  that follow the releas of a surpris contract in payrol employ  you might not want to bank too much on these read  though  in that expect have been changeabl of late and are now quit diffus  as shown in the bottom panel in the impli probabl distribut of where the fund rate will be in six month   note both that the left tail of this probabl distribut is bunch at quit low level of the fund rate and that one fifth of the mass rest abov the current intend rate   among the market particip who are count on polici eas  recent read on the labor market   both the februari employ report and the high level of initi claim   seem to weigh import in their think   moreov  with equiti wealth onc again lower and consum appear less confid  the expans of aggreg demand seem to be on a slower track than we had anticip earlier   the declin in es  of the equilibrium real feder fund rate  plot in your next exhibit  summar that downward reassess of spend relat to potenti output   inde  by these measur  maintain the current stanc of polici would impli some tighten of the real fund rate gap relat to what you view as appropri with your eas on novemb     note also that this assess is not just a characterist of the staff   s outlook and empir model  the shade region   in that the read of the equilibrium rate deriv from the index debt market  the thin line  also turn down   with inflat also inch lower in the project  the committe might view the cost of anoth    or    basi point eas as small given the stabil of long run inflat expect  the bottom panel  relat to the benefit of some s ulus to aggreg demand   for all the focus on weak in hire and in confid over the intermeet period  other data have been mix and on net have led the staff to increas the level of real gdp in this quarter and the next compar with the baselin present in januari   inde  as shown in exhibit    two  and ten year treasuri yield     the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     actual rose in the half hour window surround the key data releas repres by bar in the top left panel   that is  as the talli at the right indic  the reaction to macroeconom news cannot account for the net movement in rate sinc januari      the sharp and sudden movement in asset price at  e over the past few week on rumor of war may reveal the extent to which the current configur of financi market quot is onli loos tether to econom fundament   it seem that uncertainti about war and the economi are lead spender and investor to defer commit  but we have no way of pars the relat import of those two sourc of doubt   market price  though  appear consist with the overal amount of uncertainti abat over  e   if not  it is hard to understand whi  as shown in the two middl panel  risk spread on corpor bond narrow over the intermeet period   as governor bie mention   or whi option on swap forward rate and oil price impli that volatil are expect to move lower  as shown in the bottom panel   given this prevail uncertainti and skittish in the marketplac  the committe might be especi unsur as to how investor would react to polici eas at this junctur   go back to the transcript from the onset of the gulf war in       more than a few member doubt the efficaci of monetari polici action in spur spend when global event were in the driver   s seat   as the discuss about polici gradual at the last meet underscor  such uncertainti about the polici multipli  all els be equal  would probabl inclin you to attenu action  perhap to the point of keep polici on hold at this meet   with conflict in iraq seem at hand  this is one of the few  e it could be said that some aspect of uncertainti will lift with the passag of  e   although to what degre and how soon are not obvious at this point   defer action might also be seen as have the advantag of allow the committe to calibr it action more precis as addit inform about geopolit develop emerg   inde  the committe might want to be abl to use a signific portion of the current     basi point of room abov the zero bound in a  e fashion if event turn suffici advers   while research general counsel that the presenc of the zero bound make act preemptiv superior to argument about    keep your powder dri     that bodi of work measur  e in quarter   with war seem about to begin  you may be measur  e in day or week  and it is difficult to imagin that a short delay would leav a discern imprint on econom activ   but the committe might view those darker possibl as quit remot   rather  the committe may be read the substanti ralli in financi market when coalit troop commenc the gulf war in      as the more like outcom   if it is main worri about the world that are make household and busi hesit to spend  then the success prosecut of war against iraq should resolv some of their doubt and provid import s ulus to spend   that said  the current situat may not be near as neat as in      in that concern about geopolit tension might not be punctur by decis militari victori  given question about the format of a new govern in iraq  the prospect for terrorist action  and advers develop in other troubl spot   if that seem farfetch  i   d remind you that we are onc again at code    orang     indic heighten risk at home   your last exhibit  besid provid a rational for keep polici on hold  address the issu of the balanc of risk assess   if the committe believ that the cloud of war worri will soon dissip to reveal an economi that is fundament sound  then it should indic so by retain it risk assess as balanc with respect to both of it goal  the top left panel    the committe might also opt for a balanc risk assess if it fear that a chang would convey more convict to market particip about the outlook than it actual had   if instead  more weight were given to the downbeat econom data of late and the forecast that inflat would move lower still from it alreadi low level  the committe might favor a risk assess weight toward econom weak  the top right panel   accord to the survey evid  this outcom best match investor expect  suggest that it should be prefer if the goal is not to test the market   s resili to surpris   still  such a shift might be read by the broader public as suggest that the near term outlook was weaker than fear  a messag that might be problemat in a nation on a war foot   in fact  the public   s focus has shift to a differ stage  and in light of the unusu uncertainti  what the committe   and say today is unlik to be extrapol too far into the futur   the broader problem the committe face is whether it can use character the balanc of risk in an environ of such diffus uncertainti  this is territori that frank knight trod eighti seven year ago   as he note then and as is repeat in the middl panel     we can onli appeal to the law of larg number to distribut the loss and make them calcul       in so far as they repeat themselv      moreov  knight consid circumst when prospect were suffici diffus that  as he wrote     the concept of an object measur probabl or chanc is simpli inapplic      it may be that the current situat has transit from a sens of known possibl with assign probabl   that is  risk   to knightian uncertainti   if so  knight   s advic to the committe is that    the fundament uncertainti of econom life are the error in predict the futur and in make present adjust to fit futur condit      if the possibl are that uncertain  the committe could  as outlin in the bottom panel  defer announc an assess of the risk under the rational that it is better to be unspecif than specif wrong   such a cours would probabl requir a promis of heighten surveil to the public and a willing among yourselv to conven a confer call befor the next meet if event clarifi the odd   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you veri much   question   if not  let me move forward   today   s discuss around the tabl pretti much coalesc into signific altern outcom   i believ almost everybodi would argu that the economi is weak  and inde i suspect on the basi of the most recent number that econom activ has probabl been declin in the last two week  there was some signific improv in econom activ from christma through the first week in februari  but the economi subsequ began to weaken measur  evid in conjunct but not necessarili in line with the signific rise in gasolin price that start in earli februari   gasolin price is like a withhold tax  if i may put it that way  that is set by the servic station oper   those who purchas gasolin know exact what they are pay  and i would submit that mani peopl are far more awar of the reduct in their dispos incom come from rise gasolin price than they are of their week tax withhold  which they probabl don   t look at veri close   the rise in gasolin price has been dramat   somebodi mention earlier that this increas might in fact be a factor in the recent weaken of motor vehicl sale  the latter clear has occur  and that includ sale on an incent adjust basi  if i may put it that way   with regard to the advanc in gasolin price  which in a sens is the specif result of the current geopolit uncertainti  we can point not onli to iraq but  as other have mention  to venezuela  which is experienc serious econom and polit problem   somebodi also mention nigeria  which likewis is have sever difficulti  that countri is a veri larg supplier of oil  and it output could well go down sharpli  bob  i wasn   t awar that in texa peopl are talk about the possibl of a near term shutdown in venezuelan oil product   my impress is that product has risen from a much lower level to about   million barrel a day in venezuela   that   s still well short of their   million barrel a day capac   one of the problem they report are have  and i   m not sure it   s actual true  is that some of the oil industri worker who were fire abscond with the softwar that run mani of the well  and the venezuelan are have troubl bring output back toward full product
some of our contact indic that their product is closer to     million than to the state     million
the state     million figur  as everybodi know  is phoni
the actual number may be a littl less than half that state level
yes  but a number of the oil analyst who follow venezuela fair close are say it   s   million   now  if you want to go down and look  we   ll both go down and look
if you go down and look  there could be two open on the committe   laughter
you   re still tri to figur out way to improv this place    laughter
there   s no uncertainti about the risk of do that
in ani event  i think the argument that the geopolit risk are affect econom activ has a certain credibl  but there is no way to know how much   you can argu that the iraqi and venezuelan situat are have a negat effect  but you obvious can   t argu that all of the negat effect bear on current econom activ is a result of concern about oil   i do think that the fact that the economi slow so quick as the price of oil rose suggest that oil is play a part   moreov  it is signific that the stock market rose sharpli and oil price fell abrupt as the  e for a final decis on an iraqi war move closer   governor bernank has note that the hurdl rate goe up as we get closer to the event  but that presuppos a risk neutral and not a risk avers view of the world   so  whi is it that mere move up the  e when an event will take place creat a signific chang in one direct or the other when noth has occur to alter the way peopl view how thing will turn out   that should not happen unless there are veri signific risk advers characterist in the market  what we are in fact observ here  a veri sharp reaction  is evid in my view that the iraqi war issu is a relev consider   in particular  the role of iraq strike me as a crucial factor in light of the recent behavior of the oil  stock  and bond market  as i   ve said previous  we may think that the probabl of a veri favor outcom in iraq is    percent  but the    percent residu is veri scari   that    percent continu to be veri scari becaus noth has happen to chang the outlook signific   i would also note that the acceler in econom activ from christma to earli februari seem indic of the fact that some fair posit develop must have been go on in the under economi  which may or may not have been brought up short by the acceler in oil price  the point i   m tri to make is that we should be in a far better posit to assess the under strength of the economi onc the major uncertainti about the iraqi war are resolv  especi if it goe the way peopl expect   we will then be in a situat where we can better focus on the other uncertainti and factor affect the perform of the economi  the eros that has occur in this economi in the last five or six week has been quit signific  and we don   t know  of cours  exact whi that has occur   there are ongo develop  which have been mention today  that may have more serious consequ than we can know at this point  the natur gas issu is a veri big question   we are drill veri heavili for natur gas  yet market product bare move  that   s larg becaus improv technolog has made it possibl to drain probabl half the reservoir of a new natur gas field in the first year   sinc we are put so much of our infrastructur invest spend for energi product into a whole set of gas turbin base system  our onli new sourc of gas is liquefi natur gas   we cannot increas domest product  and we cannot increas our pipelin import of natur gas signific  of which someth on the order of   trillion cubic feet per year are come in from canada   as a consequ of that  natur gas could be a much more serious problem than we realiz  and it could have a fair signific impact on the whole petrochem industri structur  which is not a small part of this economi   that has noth to do with iraq  but it   s a realli fundament problem for the unit state  in general  i think that we have here  as a number of you have mention  a true knightian uncertainti issu   in the past when we talk about the balanc of risk  we presum that we were abl to judg that balanc  which impli some judgment of the probabl distribut on both side of the forecast   as mani of you have indic  that   not seem to be the case at this stage   our degre of uncertainti has gone up dramat  larg becaus of the appar veri mark impact that the iraqi oil uncertainti and the other geopolit risk are have on econom activ   our presumpt is that  at some point in the not too distant futur  we will be abl to turn uncertainti into actual probabl distribut on which we can make judgment   while we can consid as mani hypothes and scenario as we think may potenti be use  my suspicion is that we realli don   t know   it   s veri import for us to convey to the public that we don   t know becaus the truth of the matter is that nobodi can know  if the committe were to come out with either a balanc risk assess or a sens that the risk are on the downsid  i think such a statement would be convey more knowledg than we can possibl argu that we have  the smartest thing we could have done last year when we set our meet schedul for this year would have been to recogn that today was the wrong day to hold a meet    laughter   i tri to convey to the administr that we were go to have a meet today and it wasn   t altogeth a good idea to start a war at this particular point   but they must have lost my note somewher  in ani event  i think the bottom line here is that it is import that we communic the fact that this is truli a period in which uncertainti as distinct from risk is the domin element in all of our deliber   becaus of that as we move from uncertainti toward risk  the payoff from heighten surveil should be veri larg   that is  we are go to learn a great deal about the economi over the next sever week   as a consequ i think we will be in a posit to address the issu of whether we ought to be move or not   i do acknowledg the probabl that our next move is more like to be a reduct than an increas in rate  but i do not base that on ani knowledg that i would feel veri comfort with   it   s more an instinct than an intellectu judgment   in the circumst  i think we probabl ought to stay where we are  indic that we do not have the capabl of truli make a judgment about the balanc of risk  but nonetheless indic that we continu to view the under structur of the economi as consist with a favor outlook  factor support this assess includ improv product  i think the staff forecast for this quarter is a   percent rate of increas   this suggest that the potenti for growth of profit obvious still has consider possibl   if the stock market goe up  histori tell us that peopl who are veri depress will rapid cheer up a good deal   in my experi there is noth more effect for boost a compani   s capit appropri than have it stock price go up   that shouldn   t happen  but it     well  i shouldn   t say it shouldn   t   it   say that the market valu of exist asset has gone up and therefor the opportun cost of new asset has basic decreas   so it is quit conceiv that  if the stock market ralli signific  we may find that this economi will begin to look like the  book forecast   if it  sn   t  then i think there will be a fair strong argument that we should start to eas polici  my impress is that we will probabl know a good deal more befor the next meet   if inde that is the case and action is requir  we probabl would be well advis to have a telephon confer and decid whether or not there   s ani action we wish to take or what we wish to do   vice chair
mr  chairman  i assum that what you are recommend is that we do noth today  that we have no balanc of risk statement  and that we remain veri alert to develop   assum that   s what you are recommend  i   m fulli in favor of it
i support the combin recommend of the chairman and the vice chairman    laughter
he mere interpret what i said
the recommend and the interpret    laughter
that   s better   governor bie
i support your recommend
well  i support your recommend  mr  chairman   but i have a question for you   are you plan to say in the press statement that we stand readi to move  or are you just leav that open
no  i think what we would want to do essenti is to stipul that becaus we   re presum move from a period of uncertainti to one of risk we are involv in heighten surveil  which impli that our polici will depend on how the situat unfold   for exampl  the stock market is up    percent in europ   if it stay there  that   s go to chang a lot of thing  but i don   t know if it   s go to stay there   so it   s too soon to move in one way or the other
yes  i agre   it wasn   t clear to me how you were plan to explain our postur to the public   that answer was help   thank you
the idea is to have the possibl but not the certainti of a move  otherwis the market will be wait everi morn for us to have a meet
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   i think  as i note in my comment  that we realli don   t know enough to say anyth   i would also agre with presid hoenig in that i would tri to stay away from build up expect in the market that we are about to do someth   although we may get clarif over the next few week  i think the probabl are veri high that we could get to the next meet befor we have an idea   and even then it might not be realli clear   of where thing are go
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   my staff and i struggl mightili with how we would handl the balanc of risk statement   hat off to the person who first came up with the idea
it was a combin of the great insight of governor kohn and   reinhart
hat off to don and     i would also echo don   s comment about the need to be care that we don   t go too far in impli that a move is immin   thank you
i support the recommend   i   d like to say three other thing  first  i actual buy the knightian uncertainti analog and use that as a rational for defer the announc of our judgment on the balanc of risk   second  as dave point out  there is a strong possibl that in fact we   re not go to know that much veri soon for various reason that have come up around the tabl  and i think we want to guard against make uncertainti disabl   that is  in my view we ought to have a call in a few week  and we ought to be think about act even in the presenc of continu knightian uncertainti   the situat may not be convert to nice probabl distribut  but we may still have to act   i believ that we ought to prepar ourselv for that possibl mental   my third point is that the fund rate is low  and if it goe down ani more  it will get lower still    laughter   i   m just tri to lay this out in small step   laughter   if it get down much lower  we   re soon go to have to confront the altern or untradit measur that we   ve been tell ourselv we have in our quiver that we can use in such circumst   it   s not too soon to start think about what we   re go to do and also what we will look at to know how well we are do   i believ we have to think about both and fair soon
may i interject a comment here   ned and i had a discuss about this ye day   we have to be veri care  if we   re look at new techniqu  not to get ourselv involv in ani peg of intermedi  or longer term rate   i say that not becaus we couldn   t make it happen but becaus the problem of unwind that sort of peg will result in utter chao   we have no choic but to fix the overnight rate becaus we   ve tri everyth els and noth els has work   peg the overnight rate is a fallback posit and one that i   m sure we would endeavor to work our way out of if we could   if we decid that we want to move to the intermedi rate to tri to support rate  the last thing we want to do is to mention what our goal is becaus we will never be abl to unwind from that if we get lock in to a specif pattern   i agre with governor   that it   s certain not too soon to give some thought to these issu   but we have to be care in determin not onli how we phase our way into a particular polici but how we phase our way out   in mani respect  the latter is far more difficult than the former
mr  chairman  the present manag of the system open market account and i  as a previous manag  are absolut in agreement with you   we cannot peg an intermedi rate   it would be veri  veri danger to tri to do that
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  although i think an econom case can be made for eas polici  i support your recommend   i would also suggest that the idea of have a confer call strike me as veri use   it may be that a call wouldn   t necessarili be schedul onli for the purpos of consid a polici chang   if we   re go to have the event that we   re all anticip immin  it seem to me that a call next week or even
next week will be too soon   we won   t know enough in a week
i   m think onli in term of get updat from the staff about how thing are unfold  not in term of ani consider of polici action
well  what is the committe   s general view on this   i rememb that at the  e of the octob      stock market crash we had daili confer call for general updat
i don   t think a daili call is requir  but if you   re talk just about basic updat  is there interest in do that
i   d suggest week
yes  perhap week
that   s a great idea
one of the advantag of do that  incident  is that the interact among the committe member will creat a higher level of insight as to what is go on   too often that kind of discuss would be a wast of  e   i don   t think it would be in this case   so shall we commit to that  sever   yes
okay  let   s do it   presid  n
i support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend on the intend feder fund rate  but i have a question about the other two aspect of it   i agre complet with your rational and your discuss about the difficulti of assess the balanc of risk   what i   m concern about is that peopl in the market didn   t hear our discuss on that and it may be veri difficult to convey our mean   i think we want to be care that we don   t creat ani uncertainti that produc more problem than we   re tri to solv  that   s one concern i have  my second concern relat to the issu of heighten surveil   i think the market understand that we   re alway on the job   therefor  my concern is that peopl may look at that and think we   re like to do someth in respons to an event when in fact the event fall short of a situat in which we would want to act   so my concern relat to how we accur convey our intent
well  i think we can tri  but we will never succeed in that respect   there   s no way of so manipul the view and attitud of the marketplac that we can expect to alter them in a period like this   when there is continu in the marketplac  i think we do convey our intent  and i think we do it rather well   but this is a discontinu event with veri signific implic   we are not go to avoid the general reaction that may best be character as the market tri to figur out what this group is go to do at ani particular point in  e   we have to grin and bear it and do what we think is right  and that problem will gradual disappear   it should not be a problem that  at least in my judgment  will creat a big market distort
mr  chairman  i can accept your recommend   i have some of the same kind of reserv and concern that bill pool just express   i understand your rational  and i think it make sens   but this is a chang  and i   m nervous becaus i don   t know how the market and the public more broad are go to accept it   so when we write our statement  i think the choic of languag is go to be veri import
well  the draft languag   tri to deal with that   i   ll circul the draft so you   ll get a sens of what it tri to convey   let me just say this  howev  there is no way we can get this done without a part of the market distort what it is we   re tri to do   i know of no word that we can use to avoid that
basic  the onli question we have to be concern about are    it undermin the structur of the market or   it signific affect the credibl of this institut   i think the answer is    no    in both case   but i   m also confront with knightian uncertainti in this respect
if i could  i   d like to follow up briefli on the convers you were have with ned a minut ago   i would urg the committe to think a bit more fulli about how we would deal with the risk of deflat  and especi public concern about deflat if that hit us  should we get into a situat where we   re closer to the zero bound   i person don   t think deflat is a major current threat   i   m probabl one of the more sanguin member of the group here in that regard  and mayb it   s odd for me to be the one make this statement   look ahead  howev  i do think that deflat is arguabl a more serious potenti problem than inflat for the intermedi term  and i don   t think we can assum that the confid the public has in the fed to contain inflat necessarili carri over to deflat   we don   t have a veri good track record in deal with deflat
we had onli one event
that   s right
we   re   for
in ani case  while i don   t expect this  it   s not hard for me to imagin event unfold in such a way in the current period of volatil situat that we could find ourselv approach the zero bound   actual  i think it   s easi to imagin a situat where the fund rate move below   percent fair abrupt   i   m not anticip that  but it   s certain possibl to imagin it   if the fund rate move below   percent  the public   s concern about exact how we   re go to deal with a deflationari situat is go to intensifi quick   we need to be prepar to answer those kind of question and assur the public that what has been happen in japan is not go to happen here   while we at the feder reserv have made a coupl of public statement regard deflat  we haven   t said veri much   i think we   re go to be press to say much more if we get in this situat   for our own benefit  among other thing  i think we need to consid how we would measur the stanc of polici and discuss polici oper in the neighborhood of the zero bound   for exampl  one question is  will we have an oper instrument that will be a substitut for the fund rate if we are at zero or veri close to zero   if so  we have to have some way of instruct the desk on how to implement polici   i don   t know what that instrument would be  so we need to think about whether we are go to have one and what it would be  my own view is that it would be help  to me at least  if the staff could give us a    think piec    that might suggest in some detail what a bluebook at the zero bound might look like  what kind of altern would be present there   in ani event  i think get out in front of this issu would help us avoid make polici mistak and also help prevent public confus and fear that might make the situat wors than it need to be   we may think we have  e to do this  but i   m not sure we do   we could find ourselv in a situat like this relat quick
i agre   i don   t think we have much  e  but i believ we   ve done a lot more think about this than is impli by your remark   the real danger here is that this market is run up on the expect that the real problem is the iraqi war  that we are go to get the iraqi war resolv  and that there   s an increas likelihood that nirvana exist somewher out there   if inde there are far more deep structur imbal in the system than we perceiv or than the market perceiv  then the economi could turn around veri quick   in other word  in my view the deflat you   re concern about cannot exist unless there is an asset price deflat   the possibl that there will be a fals run up that fail to take hold is a perfect credibl scenario  and the reaction could be quit signific   in that event  i think we would have to move in a veri expediti manner   but you   re rais a question of what type of move we would make  and there has been quit a lot of think on that question
actual  mr  chairman  i have had the staff start a fact book on the zero bound situat  which will list the unusu action mention in the recent speech by you and governor bernank   it will includ the author under which the action can be taken and ani histor preced   the work has been fair close held becaus i had some concern about what would happen were it to becom known that we were activ engag in conting plan about the zero bound   i   ve also ask the staff to look into some other issu  such as whether difficulti are pose alreadi by the compress of deposit rate and money fund rate   so  we are look at that and question whether there are ani other consequ for the function of money market   problem that the bank of japan some  complain about   that would possibl inclin you to resort to unusu polici action befor you get the nomin fund rate to zero   i know that dino  work with the research depart at the new york fed  has been look into these issu as well   i guess it might be help to get a littl guidanc from the committe about whether there is a memo in my futur    laughter
well  you are look at the question of at what point money market fund run into troubl and at the  e of other structur difficulti in the system that may occur well befor we get to the zero bound
peopl are work on a coupl of aspect of that   we   re look at it in term of depositori  the compress of deposit rate and money fund rate  and just general wonder about market function   for instanc  if the general collater rate is    percent  then the unattract of fail to deliv secur is not particular high
i would argu two thing  mr  chairman   one relat to your last point  which is similar to what al broaddus had to say   it   s not the zero bound that is necessarili drive this   second  obvious on septemb    or short thereaft  we saw some of this as we were pump a lot of liquid into the market   it will be veri interest to see if anyth came out of that becaus we are talk about exact that same kind of quantit activ  though for a differ purpos obvious
i support both part of the recommend
mr  chairman  i support the recommend  too  and i   m delight to hear that this conting plan is alreadi under way   i certain hope we never have to use it  but i think it is import that we do the plan now   i have just one comment regard the phrase    heighten surveil      i hope we   re go to use that phrase or someth like it in the press statement becaus i know that market analyst have discov that everi  e we   ve use the word    monitor care    in the past we have had a move between meet
we   ve chosen not to use that word
i   m delight
i agre that we should not make a polici chang at this meet   now is not the  e to move   my desir would be to stay as low key as we possibl can and let thing play out over the next coupl of week whatev way they   re go to play out   the second part of your recommend i have a bit more troubl with   i do think the risk are on the downsid  and i don   t see a big problem with say that   when we character the risk  we talk about them for the    forese futur      certain the long term fundament continu to be good   product  inflat credibl   but for the forese futur  some of the short term fundament are kind of dicey   there are concern about excess capac in the case of busi invest and concern about employ  incom  and the potenti for declin in hous price on the consum side   so i do think that the risk are on the downsid  recogn that uncertainti cloud our abil to assess exact where the risk are  i can go along with the recommend to chang the format in our press statement   i think the market is go to read that  particular in the context of your recent tes oni or one of your speech   i forget which   as basic say that there is a probabl of an uptick after uncertainti abat and attribut that uncertainti clear to the war   in my view  the market are go to read the fact that we don   t make a statement about the risk as effect a move to the downsid  so i guess i don   t have much of a problem with that   but frank  i think say that the risk are to the downsid is better becaus it keep us closer to the norm and take us more out of play   to me do someth differ put a littl more focus on the central bank than i think is desir at this point  but on balanc i don   t have a big problem with it  i   d also like to associ myself with ned     s perspect that uncertainti itself can be paralyz   i rememb read the discuss from the last meet where we thought we   d have a lot more inform by march      as it turn out  we don   t have a lot more inform
well  that was my forecast
well  we don   t have a lot more inform as of march     and i don   t know whether we   re go to have a lot more inform by earli may
actual we do have more inform
more negat inform
no  not necessarili
the war is start
incident  rememb that i testifi as i did regard the probabl of a strengthen economi becaus that was consist with the actual forecast of the member of this committe
that   s right
i was lock into explain whi everybodi had an acceler growth forecast back in late januari
that   s right  i shouldn   t have laid it so much at your doorstep   that was what we said in our forecast as of the januari meet becaus those forecast pick up the trend from the end of last year and into the earli week of this year   that   s clear   but i think the market is go to read the absenc of a statement of risk as effect a move slight to the downsid   i   m okay with that  but i would hope  along the line of ned   s comment  that uncertainti   not paralyz us
it realli hasn   t in the past   we have move on innumer occas when we didn   t have veri much of a clue as to how the market were evolv   governor bernank
