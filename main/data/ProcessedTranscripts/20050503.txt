thank you  mr  chairman   the intermeet period began with worri about build inflationari pressur but end with a growth scare  as incom data were weaker than expect and street economist fell over themselv to cut their gdp forecast for the first half of        meanwhil  the inflat concern remain  leav trader and investor with a sens that the risk were higher   the top panel on page   graph the june and decemb      eurodollar deposit futur contract sinc mid februari   the decemb contract peak around the  e of the march fomc meet  as the market interpret the committe   s statement as open the way for a more aggress pace of tighten   but that view was short live as weaker retail sale  manufactur survey data  and a deterior trade situat all temper what had been a more bullish growth outlook   in short  the market tinker with the possibl of a more aggress tighten path but quick fell back to the baselin scenario of    basi point per meet   that can also be seen in the middl panel on page    which show the spread between the   year treasuri note and the target fed fund rate   that spread    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix           contract sharpli at the start of the tighten cycl but then settl into a comfort rang of    to    basi point   in februari and earli march the spread widen to about     basi point as the probabl of more aggress tighten seem to increas   but as the growth outlook began to be question in recent week  the spread revert to about    basi point   the bottom panel depict the yield chang in basi point of the    year treasuri note reset from the start of the tighten cycl of             and the current one  follow the chairman   s februari tes oni     year treasuri yield rose to level where they   arguabl   were less of a conundrum   ala  that also prove temporari as the fall in yield leav them stuck in a corridor between   and      percent   at      percent this morn  the    year yield is onli a few basi point higher than in mid februari at the  e of the chairman   s tes oni   the next page take a look at the yield curv and credit spread   in the past year the search for yield  improv corpor and sovereign fundament  and the assur the fed was provid regard the tighten path were common reason cite for the flatten of the yield curv   as investor move out the matur curv  credit spread narrow and impli volatil fell as market particip becam more certain that monetari polici would not bring surpris   the past few week has seen a revers  or at least a paus  in some of these trend   one except to this has been the behavior of the shape of the yield curv   the top panel graph the    to    year spread  which flatten further in recent week  howev  unlik the earlier flatten  this cannot be view as a period when investor were reach for yield or when they were veri complac about the polici outlook   nor is there evid that central bank were unusu activ   an altern  though more unpleas explan  is that this sector of the bond market is signal a further slowdown in activ   invest grade corpor and emerg market spread both widen in recent week  as investor becam somewhat more risk avers and react to some unexpect credit event   the recent widen of spread in these two sector can be seen on the right side of the page   howev  this widen of spread bare regist in the longer term chart on the left side of the page   the op ist will look at this situat and be reassur that the market are not overreact to event and are still price in a fair benign outlook   the pessimist will argu that the power of the cycl will continu to assert itself and that the period of spread widen is just begin  especi as the effect of previous tighten begin to be felt and corpor fundament shift from be in a period of improv to a period of deterior   speak of deterior  the top panel on the page   graph the price of   year credit default swap for gm  gmac  and ford sinc januari        the price of       credit protect has more than tripl  most after gm   s earn warn on march      meanwhil  spread have widen  as shown in the middl panel   although gm has more than     billion in cash on it balanc sheet and the compani is still invest grade accord to the rate agenc  it is a high yield bond accord to the market   the blue line graph the spread of a repres longer term gm note   gm spread are now wider than the bb and b index and close in on the ccc index   ford spread are also trade like high yield credit  though not as high as those of gm   the news from gm appear to have had some chill effect on issuanc in the  high yield sector more general  though the evid is inconclus   the bottom left panel show the drop off in high yield issuanc sinc the gm news   of cours  other event were go on at the same  e  such as the chang tenor of the macro data and the fall in equiti price   still  a plausibl contributori explan is that high yield manag were unrecept to take on new paper with the prospect of a larg migrat of auto relat debt come into their sector   one import question mark for portfolio manag is whether the troubl in the auto industri are sector specif or whether the general period of improv corpor balanc sheet is end  to be follow by a period of higher financ cost  margin compress  and general credit deterior   the bottom right panel graph the largest compon of one high yield bond index on a pro forma basi if gm were to be downgrad   appar gm would account for about   percent of this index   with gm spread have alreadi blown out  a downgrad may not have that much of an effect   on the theori that market have alreadi discount the news   of cours  gm and gmac are larg issuer in the invest grade sector  which is much larger than the high yield sector  therefor  we should not be surpris if there were some indigest and a period of volatil  as a veri larg amount of paper is transfer from one set of holder with one set of  e horizon and risk toler to anoth group with a differ set of prefer   as i mention earlier  impli volatil were higher  although not in all asset class   but they were higher for equiti   the top panel of page   graph the vix index sinc januari        after reach a low near    percent  the index shot up to about    percent dure the recent period of equiti price weak   it has sinc settl back but in a choppi way   in fact  the volatil of the vix   the second deriv   is as high as it has been dure period of more general market stress   fix incom and currenc volatil have been less excit   in the middl and bottom part of the page   reflect less anxieti relat to other indic   i should note that dollar yen volatil rose on friday when a brief flurri of       excit about a possibl revalu of the renminbi spill over into dollar yen and there was a temporari spike in impli volatil   final  i want to return to a subject that was mention briefli at the last meet  name  the appetit for longer date paper in europ   as you will recal  earli in      there was a mini frenzi about the need for pension fund manag to    extend durat      european issuer have been quit happi to step in and fill that demand at pretti attract level   this is despit the water down of the stabil and growth pact and evid that some countri show creativ in manag their financi to get into emu  european monetari union  in the first place   the top panel simpli graph the german and u s     year yield  german yield have been consist below those of the unit state in        parenthet i do need to note that the last u s  long bond was issu in      so the u s     year bond actual has a residu matur of    year   while a    year bund yield of just under   percent could prompt one to ask what the german word for    conundrum    is  laughter   there is no doubt that the environ has been favor to issuer   and not just for the most high rate   as shown in the middl panel  spread among european sovereign issuer have converg over the last sever year  just as promis by the propon of the monetari union   among the higher rate issuer  franc recent was abl to issu a    year bond   at the other end  greec issu an attract price    year secur   the bottom panel graph long date issuanc   that is  beyond    year   for euro area sovereign sinc        in       all long date issuanc was by three countri  germani  itali  and franc   through onli the first four month of       such issuanc has alreadi exceed that for the full year in everi recent year except        and most of the issuanc is by countri other than the three i mention earlier   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in the intermeet period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper   and i also need to talk about swap
it   s sort of sad to look at the composit of the lehman brother high yield index   i   m look at some of the name in the context of    year ago    general motor  at t  and georgia pacif   the world is tell us that there is creativ destruct out there  to what extent do the gm  ford  and collater issu  as they move out of invest grade into high yield  impact the averag yield of  say  bbbs   clear  we are get a huge increas in      the suppli of margin non invest grade bond   we can see the impact all over the place   becaus auto debt is so much larger than the debt of other issuer in that market   but i   ve heard veri littl about the measur impact  for exampl  on the bbb or the baa index   are they affect materi by this shift
well  they will be affect in the short run  as invest manag repric the gm and ford paper
i   m think more in term of the effect on the averag of these index
oh  i see   i   m sure that there would be an effect  but i haven   t look at this   as that paper was taken out  i guess it would tend to reduc the post spread   we did see that in the emerg market index  as some countri default and were taken out of the index
when argentina came out  it was a huge effect
exact   so  i would think that one would see the same kind of effect on the index itself  but i haven   t look at the specif question to check it out   mr  reinhart  it   s a question we can answer  mr  chairman   the thing i would note is that gm is a smaller compon of the bbb index than it would be of the high yield index  howev  you would be take someth that alreadi look like a high yield out of the bbb univers   in ani event  we can look into that for you
mr  chairman  just one follow up   the staff   s construct bbb index alreadi downweight outlier to tri to get a more accur  smoother index
the veri process itself would produc an effect   as soon as these issu begin to move off what would be a sort of constant bbb yield  it automat drop out
not entir  but it get downweight by a signific amount
you   re weight with respect to the posit on the spread
as the paper move from bbb to bb  for exampl  the  weight fall and then they rise again as they cross the border
yes  exact
that   s realli quit interest   i didn   t know we did it that  way   other question for dino   if not  would someon move to ratifi the domest oper  speaker      so move
without object  they are approv   you want to discuss  the swap issu next   mr  kos  yes  my favorit issu
i didn   t want to ask for a quick  routin vote without allow  e for at least a defens comment
it   s may  which mean that it   s the  e of year that i come to this committe and ask for a vote on the renew of the swap facil for mexico and canada   they get renew in decemb  but six month    notic would need to be given if the committe chose not to renew them  that   s whi we vote on it at this meet
the argument in favor remain as valid as they have been   laughter
is that defens or offens
i refus to comment further    laughter   would somebodi like to move to renew these       speaker      so move
without object   you have anoth year of grace   let   s move on to dave
thank you  mr  chairman   in review my remark from the last meet  i manag to find that at least one of my insight had surviv the intermeet period   if you will allow me  i quot     while i can easili imagin look back on these word with regret  the persist and widespread improv that we are now wit certain leav the impress that the expans is more firm establish and less fragil with respect to shock than it was in earli           unfortun  as i see it  the surviv insight is that i would come to regret my word   just how much  i think remain an open question   but the past six week have clear restor a greater sens of two way risk to the outlook   just as the great preponder of data that becam avail in the earli part of the year had led us to revis up our outlook for the real economi  it seem near everi major econom releas sinc the last meet has been to the low side of our expect   the litani of bad news has been long and vari   privat payrol increas by just         in march   in the manufactur sector  output slip a bit that month  and our es  for januari and februari were revis down   a veri weak retail sale report for march held down the growth of overal consum spend in the first quarter   with order and shipment for capit equip have drop sharpli in march  growth of equip and softwar spend is look a bit weaker in the first half of this year than was incorpor in the previous forecast  moreov  the data on merchandis trade for februari suggest that demand for our export was softer than we had expect and that a greater portion of domest demand is be met by foreign rather than domest produc   and  reflect the softer tone of the econom data  stock price drop about   percent below our march baselin assumpt   all in all  it has been a pretti downbeat collect of data   as you know  we lower our forecast of the growth of real gdp for the first two quarter of the year   we now es  that growth in the first quarter was about   percent  in line with the advanc es  of the bea  bureau of econom analysi  and more than   percentag point below our march forecast   for the most part  we didn=t see much to argu with in the bea= es   in comparison with them  we are project a slight larger contribut from net export and a slight lower contribut from inventori invest but the same top line   with much of the soft in the data occur later in the quarter  we also revis down our project for second quarter growth of real gdp to     percent  about    percentag point below our previous project  some of that weak is project to carri  forward  so that the gdp gap at the end of      is about   percent in this forecast rather than be near elimin as it was in our previous forecast   and that       larger output gap occur despit the fact that we trim our path for the fund rate by    basi point start in the second half of this year   obvious  the relev question at this point are   what are the explan for the recent spate of disappoint econom report and what are the accompani  implic for the outlook   one plausibl hypothesi is that what we have experienc has larg been statist nois that has produc a weak quarter of gdp growth but that should have littl or no implic for our assess of the strength of the economi go forward   there is evid to support this view   perhap most notabl  initi claim for unemploy insur have averag about         over the past month   a figur at the low end of the rang that has prevail as the labor market has gradual but steadili improv   and insur unemploy has also continu to drift lower   so there is not much sign of an inflect point in activ here  moreov  despit last month= weak retail sale report  home sale remain strong  and the report we have receiv from the automak suggest that motor vehicl sale were solid in april   these are develop that don=t seem consist with a view that consum are in the process of throw in the towel   and in the busi sector  anecdot report from our contact have general remain favor both with respect to their order book and their capit spend plan   those consider made us comfort discount signific the recent weak in the data   but we didn   t think it was prudent to dismiss that weak entir  either   there simpli was too much bad news   in addit  there was corrobor for some of the downbeat statist read from other sourc   the poor perform of retail sale has coincid with a sag in measur of consum sen ent over the past few month   likewis  the report from purchas manag are consist with the slower growth of manufactur activ that appear to have occur sinc the turn of the year   a second plausibl explan is that the run up in energi price is take a greater toll on activ than we had anticip   the price of gasolin has soar in recent month   and while i doubt that mani household are monitor far date futur price for oil  there may be a grow realiz that the ramp up in gasolin price is like to prove a persist drain on purchas power   that  in turn  may be lead consum to trim spend in other area   further evid that household may be view the recent increas in gasolin price as like to be longer live can be glean from the mix of motor vehicl be sold   in contrast to most of last year  we are now see sign that household are shift purchas away from larg gas guzzl model to smaller more fuel effici vehicl  busi too  no doubt  are feel the squeez on their incom  and  in light of the uncertainti about how household are respond to the recent jump in energi price  they may be pull back a bit from hire and capit spend until the  situat clarifi itself         by our es   the depress effect of the increas of oil price sinc decemb      on the growth of real gdp should be peak in the first half of this year  so the  e is consist with our view that energi price may well have been an import factor in the slowdown in activ that we have experienc   but the weak seem too extens to stem from that caus alon   accord  we have also put some weight on the possibl that the incom data are signal that under aggreg demand is not as strong as we had earlier anticip   of cours  one interpret of that observ is that the degre of monetari accommod may not have been as larg as we had previous gaug   over much of the past year  despit gradual increas in the real fund rate  our es  suggest that we could be veri comfort with the view that polici remain accommod   a view that seem consist with the incom data on the economi   we still see monetari polici as accommod  at least from a medium term perspect  but we recogn that we are now edg into grayer territori   the confid interv around es  of the equilibrium real fund rate that we show in the bluebook are intend to give you a sens of just how ignor we are about it precis valu  if that wasn=t alreadi abund obvious to you   we certain can=t rule out that we have overreact to the recent news   a rebound in april spend  a few upward revis to data from earlier month  and this recent period will bare regist a rippl on the surfac of a solid under expans   but i would note that our reaction has not been idiosyncrat either  market particip have also mark down their path for the feder fund rate by about as much as we have over the intermeet period   of cours  weaker real activ has been onli one of the difficulti with which we have had to contend   the news on inflat  for the most part  has also been somewhat disappoint  especi the read on energi and import price   in respons  we have revis up price in these two area notic in the first half of the year   the incom data on core consum price were onli a tad abov our expect   to be sure  the     percent increas in the core cpi grab consider attent   but we correct anticip that this increas would translat into a milder     percent increas for the market base core pce measur  this was higher than we had project in the march  book  but by an amount measur in basi point  not tenth   taken togeth  these develop led us to mark up our forecast for headlin pce inflat in the first half of the year by about   percentag point to    percent at an annual rate  while our forecast for the increas in core pce price has remain at about a   percent annual rate   the upward revis in headlin inflat in the       first half do have consequ for inflat go forward   higher consum price inflat  through a combin of formal and inform arrang in labor market and perhap through some slippag in inflat expect more general  seem like to find it way eventu into wage inflat and back into price   that was the motiv for the upward adjust to our project of core consum price inflat to     percent this year and     percent next year       percent higher than our march project in both year   howev  the contour of our inflat project remain the same   as in past forecast  we expect some slight eas of pressur on inflat as the pass through of higher price for oil  import  and other commod begin to wane   of cours  it remain an open question as to whether and when we will get the slow in oil and materi cost that we are project   for the most part  we continu to take our cue from futur market for these price   although i cannot see a clear superior altern  i will admit this approach has not been a surefir recip for success over the past year   dure that  e  the cumul upward revis in our forecast for core pce price in      has been about   percentag point   as we note in ye day= board brief  we believ that this revis can larg be explain by the upward surpris that we have experienc in the price of oil  import  and commod   look forward  an eas of those pressur remain an import element of our forecast   but it remain just that  a forecast  moreov  we recogn that  at some point  the consequ of a seri of cost shock could look to mani peopl an aw lot like an acceler price level   and if that view were to cement itself  the implic for inflat expect and the feedback into wage and price could be a less favor inflat outcom than shown in the  book   in that regard  we continu to draw comfort from the fact that wage inflat has shown no sign of increas dure the past coupl of year   hour labor compens from the nation account increas   percent at an annual rate in the first quarter  below both our march project and the averag pace post last year  more surpris  the employ cost index  releas last friday after complet of the  book  show an increas in hour compens of just     percent at an annual rate in the first quarter   with wage rise at a subdu pace of just under     percent and hour benefit slow to a    percent pace  the smallest rate of increas we=v seen in quit some  e   this is certain good news and suggest that we are not yet wit anyth that look like a wage price spiral   but it= still the case that we have present you with a forecast that show both higher price inflat and a wider output gap  and thus a less attract set of polici option from which to choos   moreov  if i were a sensit  share kind of guy  i=d probabl admit that the incom data have rais my anxieti about the outlook both for activ and for inflat   howev  while it wasn=t cover in ani of my manag train  i have made it a strict rule to avoid develop ani emot entangl with the forecast that i supervis so as not to complic       my profession or person life    laughter   if i step back and take a more dispassion look  while recent develop have highlight reason for concern  the outlook still remain quit favor   the economi has been averag growth at or abov potenti over the past year despit what has been a huge energi price shock  the remov of massiv fiscal s ulus  and the withdraw of monetari accommod   and after a dip in the first quarter  growth is project to return to it abov trend pace start in the current quarter   meanwhil  even with sharpli higher oil price  a declin dollar  rise commod cost  and diminish slack  core consum price are up onli    percent over the past    month   a pace that remain low even by the standard of the past decad   and we are project core pce inflat to remain at or below   percent over the project period   by most object metric  it remain a bright pictur   have accumul anoth       word of potenti regret  i should probabl turn the floor over to   at this point
the staff forecast for averag real gdp growth abroad over the forecast period has chang littl from that in the march  book despit swing in global oil price  nonfuel primari commod price  and exchang rate  plus a signific near term revis to the outlook for u s  growth   howev  the onli minor revis to our project for averag foreign growth mask signific differ across countri and region   differ that reflect the vari influenc of recent develop   in order to explor further these differ  i will highlight those develop over the intermeet period that were unexpect and offer our thought on their implic for the outlook abroad and our forecast of the u s  extern sector  despit continu expans of global activ  long term sovereign interest rate in the major foreign industri countri have drop signific on balanc sinc the previous fomc meet   for exampl  the german    year rate move down from about     percent at the  e of the march meet to reach an all  e low of      percent on april    and has remain near that low so far this week   rate in canada and the unit kingdom fell almost as much  and even japanes rate decreas near    basi point   although by themselv lower interest rate might be expect to rais equiti price  the major stock price index abroad have fallen over the period from   to   percent   these asset market develop reflect particip    reaction to the most recent data  which suggest that the foreign industri countri have encount some addit headwind that are imped growth dure the current quarter and like will do so over the remaind of        accord  we have shade down our near term project for the major foreign industri countri   although we cannot be certain  we judg that elev oil price are take a greater toll on these economi than we anticip earlier   less favor news for the u s  outlook is a factor as well   both these develop are like influenc confid abroad        euro area econom sen ent fell in april to it lowest level in a year and a half  the tankan survey in japan drop notic in the first quarter   in contrast  recent develop in the emerg market economi  although mix  are posit on balanc  and we have revis up slight our outlook for averag growth there for this year   this outcom reflect the fact that sever of the emerg market economi export oil and or other primari commod whose price have remain high   it also reflect the unexpect strong first quarter growth that was record in china   we now calcul that china= gdp grew at a    percent annual rate last quarter  almost doubl our project in march   although we expect some moder in chines output growth over the remaind of this year  it robust pace should support somewhat stronger expans in the region than we previous project   exchang market develop also contain some surpris   the dollar appreci broad over the intermeet period  particular in term of the canadian dollar and the euro   domest polit tension appear to be weigh on the canadian dollar   although we continu to build into the  book baselin slight real dollar depreci  the higher start point for the current quarter leav us with a forecast path for the dollar that is abov that in march throughout the forecast horizon  a chang that boost import and restrain export   particular focus on the chines exchang rate regim and the  e of ani modif to that regim emerg at the  e of the g   meet in mid april and again last week when market particip react quick to a short live anomali in the renminbi dollar rate   sinc your march meet  the amount of appreci price into ndf  non deliver forward  contract for chines renminbi has risen at   month    month  and    month horizon   u s  treasuri offici have made public statement call for chines offici to act soon  and the u s  congress has rais the possibl of action on it part if the chines do not move   the heighten public debat appear to have rais the sensit of market to ani indic that someth might be happen   in the absenc of ani reliabl inform on when and in what way the chines might alter the present regim  we have not incorpor ani such chang into the forecast   the extent to which other asian currenc will move against the dollar when the chines do act remain an addit major uncertainti   trade data for februari were anoth major surpris for us dure the intermeet period   those data show a second consecut month of sizabl increas in import   part of this increas is account for by a jump in the valu of oil import  but non oil import  particular industri suppli and consum good  expand rapid as well   first quarter nation incom data reflect the strength of nomin import in januari and februari in doubl digit growth of real import of good and servic   we now es  that real import rose at an annual rate of more than    percent in the first quarter  an upward revis of more than         percentag point from the figur in the march  book   we es  that real growth of core import  non oil import other than comput and semiconductor  was about    percent   far fa  than histor relationship with u s  activ and relat price would suggest   no compon among real import stand out  leav  us with no special factor that would explain the rapid growth    this quarter  we look for the pace of core import growth to moder substanti to one more consist with histor determin  particular given the downward revis of project u s  real gdp growth to about     percent   in addit  on a season adjust basi the volum of oil import is project to contract sharpli  accord  import of good and servic are project to grow onli    percent this quarter and then to expand at annual rate of   to   percent over the forecast period   put these piec togeth leav us with a first quarter negat arithmet contribut to u s  real gdp growth from net export of about    percentag point  about the same as in the fourth quarter   with import growth forecast to drop sharpli  the project contribut swing posit for the current quarter   in the second half of this year and dure       the contribut is small but negat   the near term fluctuat in import should be evid in the nomin trade  balanc as well   by the second half of this year and dure       we expect the trade deficit to widen further   net invest incom is also project to deterior  given current posit figur  we see that balanc as final turn negat next year   togeth these forecast impli a current account deficit of more than      billion in the fourth quarter of        dave and i will be happi to answer ani question
it strike me that if we   re go to get that signific a slowdown in import  we should be see it in some upward pressur on u s  industri product  provid the composit of the import chang is industri materi  which theoret would be shift to domest sourc   that is  the share from domest sourc would be higher   do you have ani insight into the detail at all   or is it just that the extraordinarili outsiz surg in the first quarter   beyond anyth reason   requir a revers to the mean
well  we have number written down for the piec  but not one that i think are readi for exposur
it has to affect domest gdp becaus  obvious  the import of capit good will have an impact on the produc    durabl equip purchas  which theoret are split into domest and foreign produc
a veri big chunk of the q  stori is oil and relat to the season adjust procedur that is now in place for describ real oil  which we question   we think that may not translat into real  e evid of this sort  becaus it is  in some sens  a statist treatment of the data as oppos to an actual real world event   other than that  consum good have been a big piec of the surpris in import  so i don   t think they would immedi have implic for u s  industri product   there is noth specif i can point to  and i admit   in fact  it   s one of the reason i highlight this   that a chang from doubl digit growth to    percent growth this quarter is a huge drop   but that is our best es
it realli depend on what the month pattern is   it could veri well be  for exampl  that januari was up sharpli  februari was down  and march was down  and the averag is still up    percent   and you keep go down  so you can   t realli see the differ
the peopl who construct these number write down notion placehold  for the differ compon for the veri  veri near term  but i don   t think they would regard them as ground in a lot of inform   they do that to see if the number they write down for the longer term is a sensibl number
we certain haven   t seen ani surg in order to domest produc that would be indic of that
on the spread that   s open up between averag hour compens of employe and the eci  employ cost index   theoret that is suppos to      mean that the mix is chang   it impli that the mix is chang toward higher skill  compon  presum   we can check that  i would assum  by look at least at the ratio of  supervisori worker to product worker   are the number move in line with that ratio
i don   t think a mix stori is explain the first quarter diverg there  the big slowdown in the benefit compon came from what the eci is measur as employ contribut to pension plan  there was a big drop in that compon   it  sn   t necessarili have to line up  in an account sens  with what   s happen in the nation incom account   so  i think it   s more than the wage mix side that seem to be
well  the interest point is that it should   otherwis  the question is whether labor incom is calcul correct
they   re not measur that exact same compon on a quarter basi in the same way
so the compens per hour may be overes  in that respect  if that   s true
it could be   but also we have seen big discrep in the past that haven   t necessarili ever been reconcil in later public of the nation incom account   so it   s conceiv
those are the worker who live in that countri call    discrep    in our world balanc of payment account    laughter
ani other question
i have a question for   concern invest   at our last meet  i certain had the feel that the outlook for the economi and for demand was a lot more robust than      i had previous thought  and the  book reflect the same view   in larg part that was base  on reject the pothol theori relat to partial expens for invest   we thought that there would be a pothol in januari   it didn   t occur   januari data on order were strong  and the staff decid  i think  that there was a lot of momentum in invest spend   certain the fundament seem quit strong   but for februari and march the data are realli veri weak   it seem to me that the respons in the  book this  e is to stick with the view that the fundament are strong and the invest spend outlook remain quit strong   there hasn   t been a lot of downward revis there   i wonder if you   d just talk about that a littl bit   one possibl might be that  in fact  januari wasn   t a perfect test of partial expens   suppos that firm could take advantag of that expens provis if they place an order by decemb     mayb some order were place and didn   t actual show up in the decemb data   they might have shown up in januari   i don   t know the detail of how that seri is construct   anoth possibl is that we may be learn from the februari and march data that the outlook for invest spend just isn   t as robust as we had thought  but it   s not becaus of partial expens   in ani event  it seem to me that there was not a lot of downward revis in the medium term forecast for invest spend   i just wonder if you would discuss your think
first of all  on whether or not we   ve experienc the pothol  i think you   re certain right that januari isn   t necessarili the perfect test   but i don   t think that the hypothesi you suggest would work  in the sens that the equip had to have been instal by the end of decemb to qualifi for partial expens
not just order
not just order   there were a coupl of except to that general rule  but the equip was suppos to have alreadi been instal   so the  e  sn   t look good for      the pothol stori   but that  sn   t necessarili mean  given how noisi those data are  that we  couldn   t still be see some pothol effect now  to be honest  we took out most of our pothol effect at the  e of the last forecast  but we didn   t take all of it out   so we certain think there   s some consist between what we   ve seen and our assumpt that there would be a pothol effect   you   re right that we certain didn   t view the march read as indic a huge turn point   we just basic fed those data through our near term statist filter  and then  beyond the near term  allow our econometr model to    speak     if you will   and the econometr model still revis down the level of invest spend over this forecast horizon   so it isn   t the case that we offset the weak that we saw  we   ve actual carri that forward
it   s a level effect
it   s a level effect   we had a drop in long term interest rate  which tend to cushion  through the cost of capit  some of the downward revis that we would have had otherwis   and we   ve allow a littl bit of the acceler effect to show through   as we look at the situat  it is still the case  if one believ that under final sale are continu to expand at a reason clip   and we recogn that that   s an open question but that   s the view that we have taken in the forecast   that the cost of capit is low   and corpor    balanc sheet still look pretti strong to us   corpor are sit on a veri big pile of liquid asset  so we don   t think there   s go to be much difficulti financ this amount of invest spend   so  this is one of those area where we have read the recent news as probabl more nois than signal   we have given it some signal  though  and that   s whi we have the level a bit lower by the end of this forecast than we did last  e
you now have higher energi price built into the forecast   signific higher energi price   and the futur market    too   i   m just wonder if you could talk about how that factor into your think about potenti output go forward
the rise in energi price that we   ve had suggest to us   and especi as we look at those far date futur contract   that this probabl is go to be a drag on the level of potenti output go forward  we made a more discret adjust in the fall to reflect that   and when we updat our entir suppli side portion of the forecast in june  we   re go to have to revisit that issu   we do see this as a factor   while we haven   t heard a lot of report of firm talk about increas scrappag of capit equip  given the signific chang in relat factor price that there has been  we   d expect to see some of that go forward   so  we look at the rise in the relat price of energi as a negat for potenti output   it would be a small negat  becaus those effect occur over veri long period of  e   it isn   t usual reflect as a veri larg discret chang in the level of potenti output  but it could be a factor weigh on it
if we had signific higher energi price than we have now  what would the sensit be
you   re rais a good question  and i don   t know the answer   there could conceiv be some nonlinear in that process   but i think we   re talk about effect that are measur in tenth of a percentag point   not quarter or halv of a percentag point   in term of the effect on multifactor product  or  in essenc  capit input go forward
you refer in your remark to the exercis shown in the packag of materi for monday   s board brief   i   m look at the pass through into core inflat of the rise in energi price  import price  and commod price   if back in decemb        which is your baselin for this exercis  you had had a forecast for energi price  commod price  import price  and the dollar that is consist with what happen  would you have expect your model to show this much pass through to core inflat price   or would this  result have been surpris
the result of that exercis suggest  if anyth  a littl surpris that we didn   t get a touch more pass through   actual  i was surpris when i first saw those result but not after i sat back and thought more care   certain  if you had told me in late       when oil price were     to     a barrel  that they were go to be someth north of      that the market would perceiv that as be veri larg a perman chang  that we would see an ongo depreci of the dollar and a veri signific acceler in intermedi materi price  i think i would have said core consum price inflat now of just    percent would be a pretti good outcom   so  as i thought more about it  i was more comfort with the result that we present ye day  now  as we indic in the  book in an altern simul  while we are comfort with our inflat forecast  we could certain understand it if you were less comfort with our assess of the pass through to core inflat  given that this has been an area where we have made persist error   it   s veri hard to es  these pass through effect   i know of work done over the year at the board and by reserv bank staff aim at tri to es  indirect energi price effect or import price effect   some  the coeffici are zero and some  they are larg   it look to us as if  more recent  the size of those coeffici has diminish  but that      could simpli be a function of the fact that mani of those variabl were relat stabl over a long  period of  e   it   s just veri hard to es  precis what the effect are   our altern simul  where we doubl the size of those pass through effect  is intend to give you a sens of how far thing could get out of line if we made a rather big error in the size of the pass through   and  as we note  there would be a veri notic effect go forward   so  it   seem reason to wonder not onli about whether we have the under forecast right for oil  import  and other commod but also whether we have the pass through of that correct
the first quot of nipa  nation incom and product account  data show a larg increas in inventori accumul outsid of what we talk about in term of oil  effect   i   m rather curious about the inventori issu   where are these inventori   are they in  final good  are they in intermedi good   are the inventori produc domest or abroad   what is the implic  in term of the futur industri impact  of this accumul of inventori i was just wonder if you could expand a bit on your view of that
first  i   d note that we are not necessarili buy into the bea   s march assumpt  which show anoth veri larg inventori accumul   in fact  that   s one of the area where  in write down our forecast  we differ   to the tune of about    or    billion   with the bea   we have a lower level of inventori invest   so  that   s just their forecast against our  at least on our assess  the bea   s figur overst the extent to which inventori were accumul in the first quarter  now  in term of look for area where there are inventori imbal  it   s quit clear that one problem area is the motor vehicl industri   they   re still sit with a veri larg day    suppli of car and especi of truck   we do think the implic of that would be a drag on gdp growth      go forward  and we   re alreadi see sign that the auto manufactur are cut back  product   the other problem area are a littl harder to identifi   suppli of some type of chemic look a littl high at this point  and in paper and print and a few other area there appar are some higher level of inventori   sale ratio   we think that is part of the reason whi  we   re in a bit of a soft period for industri product   when we look at that flow of good system that we report occasion in the  book   which  sn   t use the census bureau and bea data  on inventori but infer inventori from what we think is go on with product and consumpt   that show not much go on at all   if anyth  the weak in industri product suggest that mayb the inventori invest in the census bureau data may be overst to some extent   so  it   s an area we   re watch  but it  sn   t seem to us as if a signific problem has develop  i might note also that ye day   s purchas manag    report show a drop in the number of purchas manag who view their custom    inventori as too high   that had inch up   and it   s come back some    so at this point  we   re inclin to think that some of what has happen in the first quarter was probabl unintend inventori accumul   that is a negat for the second quarter   s gdp growth  but it isn   t what i would call a signific inventori cycl at this point
the flatten of industri product in march in that flow  of good system seem to reflect a rather larg liquid  season adjust  of motor vehicl inventori   i was curious whether there was ani awar of that on the part of bea  becaus clear those data were avail at the  e when bea made the gdp forecast   do they show a separ inventori for motor vehicl
they do   i don   t actual have that figur in front of me   in motor vehicl  they are basic do a unit account   they use differ season than we do  but they should be show someth like that
so they   re either miss that  or they   re show a signific larger increas in non automot inventori than we have
i   d like to ask a question of   about import price growth  particular in the retail sector   in term of import good sold through our retail chain and the  e of the increas price pressur we   ve seen  is that weight heavili toward march and recent activ in april   could you expand on that a littl bit
we collect import price at the border  so to speak   so i can   t speak to the question of this show through to retail price     might want to comment on that  i don   t know  import price inflat has been surpris us a bit on the upsid  and we have attribut part of that to higher global commod price   it show up in our case in the industri suppli type of categori  but we   ve seen some in the manufactur area as well   when we break out the actual data for how import price have move  we   re get contribut from both those piec into  import price inflat    so  relat to the last  book  we have extend the period of elev import price increas into the second quarter and a littl into the third quarter becaus the global index of commod price   base on futur at this point for those period   show the price not rise further but remain high  and we think it will take some  e for that to be fulli reflect in our import price   but one factor that seem to caus the  e to be off a littl bit in our forecast      last year was that commod price tend to be show up more rapid in u s  import price than  our model would suggest is the histor averag   we have that as a second term  in addit to foreign price and the exchang rate and so forth  so embed in our stori is that import price were high in the first quarter and will deceler somewhat in the second and third quarter  but not huge and not as much as we had thought befor   it involv a somewhat more extens pass through of high global commod  price into import price  and a littl bit is probabl still the effect of dollar depreci at the end of        those thing  in essenc  go away thereaft  and we have import price inflat drop down veri much   to less than   percent in        that is condit on two assumpt  the assumpt we have been make routin for the dollar of late   becaus we don   t know a better one to make   which is that it will chang onli littl go forward  and the futur path for commod price   so the project that import price will deceler in stepwis fashion through the second half of this year and into      is veri much a reflect of these two condit assumpt   and we don   t have a whole lot of inform other than that
ani further question for our economist
mr  chairman  i would note that i do have in front of me a tabl show the bea   s assumpt for march  and the bea is show a liquid of motor vehicl stock but veri larg accumul elsewher
if there are no further question  who would like to start off the committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in our call this round  we tri to get a sens of the depth and the breadth of the current soft patch and how much of it might be associ with higher energi price   my contact report that growth has moder somewhat in the seventh      district   while the manufactur sector is still quit robust  there are some hint of slow order  and the big three auto manufactur are still hurt  our retail contact note that busi is a bit softer  but they don   t seem alarm   retail  say that higher gasolin price are affect sale   middl incom consum are switch from specialti store to discount  and lower incom consum are cut back more notic  gasolin price are depress the demand for larg suv  as   mention   i   d add that order for recreat vehicl are down signific as well   but air travel continu to be strong despit higher fare  busi spend continu to be solid   the heavi equip market is the strongest in year   one manufactur in this sector said that he was increas capit expenditur    percent this year to allevi product bottleneck in exist facil  though not to build new plant   in contrast  a larg diversifi manufactur has start to see some soften in order in the last few week  although busi overal remain good  on the price front  the big stori continu to be energi   there is now a more pervas  sens that higher energi price are here to stay   we   re hear this from the auto industri  from retail  and from firm in the energi sector   nonetheless  a major oil compani told us that they remain cautious in their invest plan   despit signific higher spot price and elev long term futur  they   re still use an assumpt of     a barrel when evalu new product project   so it seem that oil price will have to remain elev for a longer period of  e befor the industri becom will to expand suppli through aggress long term invest  in addit to energi  we   re still hear about cost pressur elsewher  notabl for construct materi  rubber  and plastic   some of these pressur may be creep into expect   for exampl  a manufactur firm told us that enter      they budget for a        percent declin in materi cost  but their actual cost end up   percent higher  and this year  they   re budget for anoth   percent increas   look downstream  mani manufactur have been abl to pass through cost increas  and  in a few particular strong sector  firm have even been abl to increas margin  with regard to labor cost  a major retail report that for the first  e in two year they had to offer higher start salari for sale associ   howev  our contact at temporari help firm see wage increas at the same rate or perhap a littl more slowli than earlier in the year  and union contract have been restrain   union wage are flat or come down  more contract includ lower pay for new hire  and health care cost continu to be shift to worker  turn to the nation outlook  our best assess is that price pressur remain a concern and that the current soft patch is not the begin of a major slowdown in the economi   with regard to growth  most of the fundament remain strong   monetari accommod and the under trend in product continu to support solid growth   the claim data suggest a firmer labor market than we saw in march  and i don   t get the sens from my contact that consum or busi are retrench in a signific fashion   accord  growth should pick up at a pace abov potenti in the second half of the year  with regard to price  we expect that higher cost will continu to pass through to the consum level  boost core inflat to around   percent this year   but we expect core inflat to stabil or edg off a touch in       main becaus we don   t think there are broad base resourc constraint   still  these assess are uncertain   we   re not realli sure which shock are most respons for the soft spot and what their ul  impact might be on the output gap   if factor such as increas caution or reduc polici s ulus are the main culprit  then there may be a persist widen in the gap  as in the  book forecast   to the extent that is the case  it may be      appropri to remov polici accommod veri gradual  say  along the path that   s embed in  futur price right now   but we need to do more than that if the weak larg reflect a reduct in potenti output due to higher energi price   otherwis we would be accommod an advers suppli shock and would risk unhing inflationari pressur  so far  long term expect appear to be fair well anchor  although some measur have crept up slight in recent month   if we have a few more month of bad price data  we   ll need a more aggress polici respons to avoid a pickup in long term inflationari expect   for today   s meet  i think we should continu on our current pace of rate adjust   howev  the statement should avoid give the impress that the recent soft in econom activ diminish the under inflat risk
on balanc  after hit a soft patch in march  econom activ in the fifth district appear to have bounc back somewhat in april   the improv was center in manufactur and retail  where modest growth replac flat activ in march   servic firm  meanwhil  continu to report the moder growth we   ve seen over the last sever month  district manufactur suggest that demand general remain solid  and mani indic that they   ve success pass through higher energi and materi cost   our shipment and new order index both move up for april   most of our manufactur contact say that they do not plan to reduc capit spend in come month and that they remain reason op ist about futur prospect   the except to this pictur is  as usual  in the textil  apparel  and furnitur industri that compet direct with chines produc   they continu to complain of a lack of price power  and their capit spend is general limit to maintain rather than expand capac   our index of manufactur wage continu to firm even though the employ index      weaken   the wage gain are be report in higher skill industri  howev  while it is  elsewher in the sector that worker are be shed  the recent bounc in retail sale in the fifth district appear to be center in big ticket item   in our april survey  big ticket sale post their strongest read sinc juli        sharp uptick were regist in retail employ and wage as well   hous activ remain solid in our district   home sale are strong in most area and quit robust in some  includ my own neighborhood where i receiv six offer in one day on my hous  on the inflat front  our april survey suggest that price pressur remain contain  though the rate of increas in price paid by manufactur edg higher   we continu to hear concern about have to pay higher energi price  and a few produc also complain that higher energi cost are dampen consum demand  turn to the nation pictur  the data we   ve receiv sinc march have been disappoint on both the real side and inflat   the slow in the real side has been broad base  and although it has been relat mild overal  the deceler in capit spend is particular disappoint given the expect that busi invest would general drive this expans  on inflat  core pce inflat continu to move up   the latest report show it at a     percent annual rate over the last three month  consider abov the     percent rate over the twelv month to march   if this situat were to persist  it would present a classic dilemma for monetari polici  weaken real growth and rise inflat  at this point  howev  there are good reason to think that it will not   first  the econom  fundament under this recoveri appear sound   prospect for growth in real household incom look good  and  although capit spend may not soon replic last year   s strong pace  invest prospect look reason good as well   as a result  i share the  book   s view that the soft patch      should be temporari   the fifth district report of a rebound in april that i mention earlier are  consist with this view as well  second  weak real data did not chang the board staff   s es  of potenti output   instead  the  book forecast has a more protract narrow of the output gap  with a signific wider gap still near   percent to the end of        it seem reason to believ that this wider output gap will help push core pce  person consumpt expenditur  inflat back below   percent  and this view get some support from the gratifi fact that tip  treasuri inflat protect secur  inflat compens has declin a bit sinc march  both for the first five year out and the five year after that   moreov  market particip expect inflat to remain that well contain even with about   percentag point less of expect tighten by the end of      than had been foreseen as of march   that rais the likelihood that actual and expect inflat can be contain without the aggress type of fund tighten that has been need to do so in the past   one might think that with eight week to go until the next meet and with the possibl of the soft patch expir soon and remov the dampen effect on out year inflat expect  we run the risk of be overtaken by event and rise inflat pressur   i tend to think  howev  that market particip understand our prefer well enough that the yield curv will react sensit to the data should inflat risk pick up   we should be sure that our communic don   t inhibit that process
thank you  mr  chairman   new england and the nation seem to have hit a coupl of bump along the road to steadi growth   we  like the  book  don   t expect the bump to turn into pothol or disturb much except the speed of travel slight   but we were again remind that there is a level of uncertainti about a rang of econom variabl        in new england  beig book contact were remark upbeat in earli april  and avail data report a sens of solid growth in the region   howev  sever recent indic and a sens of caution suggest the possibl of an emerg slowdown in the region  on the posit side  employ ad job in februari and march  and the quarter total was posit as well   unemploy rose slight  but this was due entir to a stabil in the region labor forc after a period of declin   unemploy claim move down  and both the tradit help want index and mon  com   s index of onlin job post increas at a solid pace   as the weather brighten  tourism did as well  and busi travel in boston has been strong  at least relat to last year   with averag revenu per room rise at a near    percent pace  hotel look pois for a good year   surpris  even in this servic industri  product improv are possibl  as averag hotel staf report has drop from    per     room in      to    per     room in        this is said to be the result of technolog chang and the grow popular of onlin book  beig book contact in retail and manufactur were  on the whole  rather op ist  moder grow demand and increas price power were keep margin strong  and a continu emphasi on product growth and conserv capit spend left most of our contact confid of meet their revenu and profit goal for the year   higher cost for oil and oil relat input and for certain type of skill labor were a concern  and mani contact comment on a general more inflationari busi environ   inde  provid of busi and strateg consult servic report strong growth  with one contact state that cost contain is not as big an issu as it was but that strateg matter were becom more import  overal  confid seem good  and that was reflect in the various region survey of busi confid   on the negat side  consum confid slump bad in april  reflect      doubt about both current condit and the futur   this was like due to concern about rise oil  price  as local price for home heat oil rose at a      percent pace  doubl the nation averag  and gasolin price rose sharpli  as they did elsewher  residenti real estat market  while still strong  level off and soften at high price point   actual  i think presid   is probabl not ask enough for his home    laughter   i don   t find that i   m get as mani offer for mine  and a region index of lead econom indic point to slower growth ahead   these tentat indic of a slowdown could well evapor  howev  and some moder in demand may be good  particular given the stronger price environ  data for the nation have been disappoint in april  both on the demand side and on the price side   the latest news in labor market is three day away  and while that could surpris on the upsid  given recent claim and help want data  the number for march were more subdu than we had expect   equal disappoint were durabl good order and trend in manufactur output  though as a partial offset to this i found the april loan offic survey data interest in that they suggest strength in c i  commerci and industri  lend   contract were also seen in retail sale  with and without auto  and in home build  although from a fair strong base  advanc gdp data suggest unintend inventori accumul as the first quarter end  reflect a slowdown in final demand and a drag from net export   as in new england  this could well be just a bump in the road   and given the unwelcom nudg up of core price data  it might be help in curb further inflat   it   bear watch  howev  as we gaug how fast to adjust polici   at this point  my view is that it would be unwis to overreact to the recent indic of soften   they could well be temporari  as mani have note  inde  i thought dave   s comment on the resili of the u s  economi against a number of      challeng over the past year or so quit import to keep in mind   whatev it caus  i think the  resili of the u s  economi has been a hallmark for at least most of the last decad  and i think we would be wise to keep that in the front of our forecast  right now  given the uptick in price  we aren   t make much progress in get back to some sens of neutral as far as polici is concern   our forecast in boston and that in the  book suggest that growth will continu at a pace that will use up at least some excess capac by the end of the forecast period   recogn that es  precis when an output gap will close is chanci at best  i believ we need to continu to move polici to a point that is not s ul by the  e that gap close and that do so gradual will help to eas the impact on the economi  if incom data continu to disappoint  we may find it necessari to paus along the line that the fed fund market expect   convers  upsid surpris  particular on the price front  are also possibl   so i would not rule out a fa  pace of upward polici movement if circumst warrant later in this year   the point is  i think  that our vision of the futur is now a bit cloudier than  it was   that take me to the real action at this meet   not so much what we do but what we say about it   i   ve been uneasi with our use of the    measur pace    languag becaus it seem to provid a level of certainti to market particip that could encourag inappropri risk take  inde  while risk spread have widen from their low point  they still remain quit low  howev  there has been concern that take away the    measur pace    languag would be disrupt in that it would seem to say onli one thing  that polici accommod would be remov at a fa  pace than previous   but weaker than expect incom data may have provid a greater sens of two side risk  and that may have offer us a good opportun   we may now have the chanc to drop    measur    from our lexicon  while preserv the flexibl to take ani action necessari at our next meet without the sens that we have somehow not prepar the market        i think we ought to make the most of this opportun and get out of what has been perceiv as a polici pledg   the economi has becom more uncertain   our commit to price stabil and maximum sustain growth continu unab  of cours  but we are less certain about the polici path we will need to take to fulfil those goal   let   s go back now to simpli say what we   re do and whi and let the market assign it own probabl to futur polici chang   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i interpret what is character as soft in some of the recent data releas as an indic that at least the risk to the path of real output growth  which has averag     percent sinc the end of the recess and     percent over the last eight quarter  may have increas   it   s my sens that both consum and busi confid may still be a bit more fragil than we thought  and it seem most like that the skittish is more due to the uncertainti about high energi price and their like persist rather than a reaction to higher interest rate  recent data and the anecdot report i hear from our southeast busi leader  from both larg and small compani  seem to suggest some new caution when it come to spend and hire decis   a director who is a senior level execut of georgia pacif corpor say that recent box sale  which track consum nondur fair well  have taper off slight  wherea anoth director  who is chief financi offic of up  report that busi is steadi but not spectacular  at a meet of our small busi advisori council two week ago  there was a near consensus among those in the non servic sector that persist high energi price were take a toll on profit and were caus some capit spend plan to be put on hold   obvious  the earn problem of the two airlin headquart in our district were exacerb by higher fuel cost       furthermor  the larg gain in temporari employ may be indic of reluct to add full   e employe unless absolut necessari  despit the increas uncertainti  howev  i view the most like path for output  as    the  book  to be near or even abov potenti and  as such  unlik to requir attent from monetari polici   i   m a bit more concern about the recent price develop which  while not alarm  have now given us sever month of upward tilt to measur of inflat   regardless of the index one prefer  the price pressur we see in our region  while mirror the general upward drift reflect in the nation data  are still uneven  with some intend and actual price increas becom more widespread and stick and other be greet with resist   for exampl  our georgia pacif execut report that for the last two month attempt to get price increas on mani consum product were meet with less success than was the case in late        he indic that his custom now were more aggress play supplier off against one anoth   at the same  e  he report that the price of build materi were now clear reflect the higher energi cost involv in their product  residenti construct in florida remain white hot  with continu concern about specul in those market as i   ve been report for a while now   and just two day ago  one of our former director from central florida report that one of the area   s largest contractor was told that concret was about to go on alloc and to discontinu saturday deliveri   that same sourc also indic that drywal was about to be in short suppli again  at the same  e  our staff   s work on disaggreg the cpi inflat data indic that the largest contributor to increas inflat have come most from factor other than the pass through of energi cost   name  increas in new and use car price  lodg cost away from home  and      the rental equival measur for hous   over the past six month  the negat contribut to  inflat from good has been revers  more clear expos the under trend in servic inflat  which has been rise at near   percent for the past year  in short  the various price and real side data  temper with anecdot report  lead me to the assess that  while the risk to the real side economi have clear increas  the risk to inflat are now clear to the upsid and polici remain accommod   market are expect anoth     basi point of tighten today  and this seem to me the right path for us to be on    have said that  i conclud that  with the increas uncertainti about the real economi  we need to think hard  veri hard  about just how much we realli know and what to say about the path of polici go forward   like presid    i suggest that it might be  e to let some of the polici uncertainti show through   thank you  mr  chairman
presid  n
thank you   well  two issu have been weigh on my mind   they   re realli the two issu that dave   address   first  is the recent reduct in the  book forecast rough appropri  or will the economi do appreci wors or possibl signific better than that   second  is the forecast of modest inflat still tenabl in the face of the increas in  most core measur that we have seen  i must say that i think there is a danger of over interpret and overemphas a batch of statist  all of which becam avail within sever week in april  given their reliabl or unreli and given that not all of them seem to me to be a particular surpris   still  i wouldn   t total dismiss them  so i am inclin to reduc my forecast of growth  although it   s perhap still a bit abov the  book project of     percent   plus  for what it   s worth  our intern forecast model grind out about   percent growth quarter after quarter   i   m more op ist than that and      mayb a touch more op ist than the  book for three set of reason  one  the fundament   two  the natur of the anecdot i   ve been get  and three   and perhap most import    histori  as far as the fundament are concern  we have the usual suspect that we   ve been talk about at this tabl for sever year now  continu comfort financi market condit  under expans in product  a general lack of suppli side constraint  and still healthi consum and corpor balanc sheet on averag  as for the anecdot  discuss with busi leader in our district and an examin of district econom data for the most part yield posit conclus   manufactur is clear continu to advanc  employ is increas  and labor market appear to be gradual tighten  especi in area where mine and energi activ are strong   consum spend activ is continu to expand  and report on capit spend and commentari associ with capit spend from director are realli quit strong overal   all of this is balanc a bit by a note of caution  which has crept in among firm with larg exposur in the transport sector  but i would have to say that the anecdot preponder have realli been quit posit  as far as histori is concern  i consid particular relev the long expans of the     s and the     s   in my view  those expans were not particular depend on good luck nor on astut polici conduct with exquisit precis  although i do believ that polici made a posit contribut   but i think the real lesson of those expans was that the economi is fundament sound  flexibl  and resili   and i don   t think those trait have been alter or have diminish just becaus we   re in a new decad   so that give me a fair amount of confid that the outlook remain favor and that the expans remain well ground        as to inflat  i continu to think that moder inflat will prevail  with the perform of core price probabl at a pace compar to that over the last five or six year on averag   still  there is no deni that core measur of inflat have been increas persist sinc late        and this   give me a bit more concern   and it make me a littl more cautious than i was former about the inflat situat current and about the outlook for inflat   thank you
i realiz i   m enter an ongo convers midstream  but some  it may be use to have a fresh set of eye and ear to at least give an interpret of what he or she is see   i went back and read the minut of the last sever meet   i   m glad to see confirm  mr     that you do have a sens of humor    laughter  but i do detect someth of a notic disson between the last sever meet and current in term of what   s in the bluebook  what   s in the  book  and the tenor of the discuss   and i   m go to use a basebal analog to describ how i see the situat from the perspect of the fomc as a batter at the plate  it seem to me that over the cours of the last mani meet this committe saw a fair consist deliveri from the pitcher   s mound   these were fast ball that came right across the middl   in the strike zone between the knee with   percent inflat and the letter with   percent inflat   it was the predict pitch come down the pipe  as they like to say in basebal   and you   i can   t say    we    becaus this is my first meet   assum a batter   s stanc accord and manag to continu to round the base without creat ani imbal  now the data and anecdot evid indic that the economi has at least chang pitcher  and we   re get a few curv ball  mayb some knuckl ball  mayb some split finger fast ball  and an occasion chang of pace   the inevit question is   do we adjust our batter   s      stanc or keep what work for the fast ball pitcher who has been on the mound for the last seven  inning   and unlik you  cathi  i   m go to save that discuss until the second part   but i do want to address myself to the kind of pitch we see come across the plate in the eleventh district and also nation and global  sit where i   m sit and look at that map on the wall  of cours  the district is probabl drawn in relat scale to the ego of my fellow countri peopl   but as the second largest manufactur state  the second largest in term of employ in the high tech sector  and a major transship point with signific retail activ  i think there may be some proxi valu in our district   s perform   so i just want to report that  wherea befor we were lag the economi  we seem to have caught up with the pace   we think econom activ in our region grew at around   percent in the first quarter  manufactur activ in general in the eleventh district  and high tech manufactur in particular  has pick up in pace   there has been a notabl improv   as for energi relat activ  which is a  eotyp for our district   we do have oil   the best way to summar it is the way one of our contact summar it   if you can pass a drug test and you can speak spanish  you can get a job in the oil sector   there are a lot of price pressur from the standpoint of employ  howev  in the petrochem sector  we haven   t had ani report of pass through activ in term of price power  and i don   t think that is unimport   and we are not hear report of increas price power general from our retail and other   other than for account becaus of sarban oxley   now  i don   t know how good a proxi that is   we   re a veri open economi   i don   t know what the output gap of texa is  for exampl  it   s a veri porous economi   but this is confirm by our contact with larger global oper   and against my background  have spent the last five year as a strateg advisor to up  exxon  ed  and wal mart  etc    and by the way       particular with the railroad   i   ve taken advantag of that to reach out and tri to get a feel to see  how it correspond with what we   re see local   we   ve had a coupl of confirm impress  on the domest economi  there seem to be an expect of a   to     percent growth rate  and peopl are adjust to that expect   one of our contact  the ceo of a compani  remind me that we went through a period in the earli     s when economist lower expect for growth to     percent  and we were veri happi to see   percent against that set of expect   he went on to say that now everybodi is what he call    eeyor      down in the chop about growth that   s not   percent   but in his view      percent  and i quot  is    darn good growth     on the energi sector  one can   t get a better view than from the compani that oper in our state  the larg transnat compani  and if you   ll forgiv me  from a dinner we had last sunday night with those ceo and the crown princ of saudi arabia   it was a small group that met to discuss what they thought was go on in energi price  for what it   s worth   and it   s a fair good sourc  i think   in term of current price  the discuss at the tabl focus on the fact that some percentag of that price is due to financi and specul activ   as summar by the ceo who will remain unnam but who run the largest oil compani in the world  the market seem to be price in a suppli disrupt some  e this winter   to quot him     for the life of me  i cannot figur out where it   s go to come from and the degre of price  but it   s not insignific     anoth compani es  that the amount be price in for financi specul and potenti disrupt activ is somewher around     a barrel   but a key point is that the chemic guy are not find it easi to pass on cost increas at the nation level or at the intern level either   in addit  there is suffici refin capac for current product level and not a great expect that there will be signific addit to refin capac        they   re not abl to pass on increas   neither are the retail   one retail note that an abrupt halt to sale of household good took place in march  which his firm think was driven by the slowdown in new hous start   one of the nation   s largest retail  which is continu to build it capac to sourc in china  report that price pressur in construct new store is signific becaus of higher price for the materi that are go in   steel aggreg and so on   but as to what they sell  and i quot     price have not risen  they   ve just stop fall   we can   t discount aggress without hurt our margin and we don   t have the leeway to rais price     and one last input from the ceo of one of the nation   s largest railroad  and by the way the cfo of one of the largest air shipper  their shipment are gear signific to transocean trade  the nation   s largest railroad report to us that they   ve seen a    percent growth this last quarter in their intern busi   that is particular gear toward the tran pacif trade  and through this len it appear that our manufactur and retail are expect to continu signific boost their invest for sourc in china   as one of them said  they are ramp up their spend in china and continu to arbitrag labor with china   from this and our intern  contact   mine by the way end abrupt and happili on march    when i join this organ  for which i   m grate   we infer that the effect of global on our assumpt about resourc slack and the constraint on the economi and the tradeoff between inflat and unemploy have yet to run their cours   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   it has been less than a year sinc i return to the polici tabl  but alreadi there is a sens of dj vu all over again    laughter  the recent pattern of higher inflat and softer spend seem remark similar to the develop we wit late last spring and earli summer   then  as now  after a spike in energi      price   the latest data on employ  retail sale  and durabl good order reveal unanticip  weak on the real side of the economi   read on overal and especi core inflat have been uncomfort and unexpect high   if the current situat persist or deterior further  we could face some difficult polici choic ahead  but i remain cautious op ist that the slowdown in growth and the uptick in inflat will both prove transitori  i believ we can draw some lesson for assess current condit and for calibr polici go forward from last year   s experi   last year   s jump in energi price deliv a signific shock to consum and busi   for a  e  the growth of consum spend slow and inflat increas   but after the initi jolt  the growth of consum spend and econom growth overal rebound   higher energi price again have hit consum hard in the pocketbook and busi on the bottom line  but there   s good reason to anticip a similar recoveri in spend this year  especi with oil price have come down of late   so the lesson from last year   s experi is that we shouldn   t overreact to the present soft patch or short run fluctuat in real side data when the fundament for growth appear to remain relat sound  i  therefor  find myself in agreement with the  book   s perspect   beyond the current quarter  the forecast has been revis onli slight  with the major compon of demand project to continu expand at a fair healthi pace   this forecast mirror the percept of our twelfth district busi contact who  outsid of the bay area and los angel proper  report that they remain quit upbeat about the economi  for inflat  last summer   s experi similar advis a cautious polici reaction to the data   the recent uptick in core inflat probabl reflect pass through of cost pressur due to higher energi  commod  and import price   if so  the upturn is apt to be transitori  sinc now       just like last summer  under pressur on core inflat appear to remain subdu   sever of  the good fundament drive the outlook for inflat are worth highlight  first  the data survey in part   of the  book suggest that at least some  and possibl consider  slack remain in labor market   corrobor this view  our contact  even in some of the most rapid grow area of the twelfth district  report littl troubl fill job open except in some skill trade that are in high demand in construct   i met recent with top execut of sbc west  a major employ in california and nevada   they indic no difficulti whatev in hire at ani skill level  with onli a few except  such as account   like most of our contact in the district  they also saw no signific wage pressur   inde  nationwid data suggest that labor cost pressur appear quit restrain   for exampl  as   note  last week   s eci data show no sign of ani acceler in privat compens  the under trend in product is also solid  and  as i discuss at a previous meet  i remain op ist that it will remain so  in which case unit labor cost are like to remain constrain   our contact report continu scope for product improv   for exampl  the sbc west execut with whom we met explain how new technolog permit task to be perform via comput at headquart that in the past requir technician to make servic call  of cours     price power    is a phrase that is use frequent by our contact  but the mention of price power is focus exclus on pass through of cost increas due to energi  materi  and transport   in construct  agricultur  and transport  firm report consider success in pass these cost increas along   in other sector  the experi has been more mix   one director who run a major cloth retail report onli limit pass through to consum price in the face of competit pressur and continu gain in product   with markup still high  firm should be abl to absorb some cost increas without rais good price       moreov  to the extent that these cost are be pass through to price  they appear to provid  onli one  e boost to the price level  in term of polici  i support a    basi point increas at this meet and retain the    measur pace    descript of the like path for polici go forward  at least for today   weak real side data might suggest a paus to evalu the extent and like durat of the slowdown   but incom inflat data could justifi more aggress action   given the latest uncomfort high read on inflat  i think we have to remain vigil   the constanc of long run inflat expect provid some reassur  although i worri that if we had similar read on such expect in the earli     s  they would have been slow to rise then as well  as bond market had grown complac about inflat  last  e  we adopt languag that mani of us thought made our balanc of risk statement tautolog   in fact  it turn out that the statement is not tautolog  and i no longer consid it true    laughter   in my view  even with appropri monetari polici action  the risk to the attain of sustain growth is unbalanc to the downsid  while the risk to the attain of price stabil is unbalanc to the upsid   it is the risk to our dual object  but not to each individu object  that i consid balanc overal  releas an unchang balanc of risk statement might suggest to some that this committe has ignor the palpabl shift in econom condit toward higher inflat and slower growth   inde  an uncharit descript of the current statement is that it has gone from not serv ani purpos to potenti be perceiv as factual incorrect   rather than tri to modifi the balanc of risk statement  i think it is perhap  e to retir it  for reason that i will explain in more detail in the polici go round
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet i said that i was happi to report that the fourth district was no longer an outlier in the beig book and that econom activ in the region appear to be gradual improv   but that warm glow appear to have been short live   sinc our last meet  econom activ in my district has shift down somewhat  conform to what we now see in the nation economi  in both the beig book process and my convers with busi contact  i   ve been especi keen to elicit inform about price pressur and the reemerg of price power  the tone regard price power also appear to have soften   although i still hear that there   s an abil to pass through some higher raw materi cost  the major of my contact are onc again report that it is difficult to pass on price increas  my instinct is to be concern about the possibl of further inflat creep over the year   after all  most of the inflat surpris have been on the upsid for quit a while now   but from my perspect  the issu that we confront is whether to regard the inflat situat as unfortun but transitori  or unfortun and persist  the  book project treat energi shock like rock thrown into a pond   the energi shock creat a rippl that dissip over  e   the price statist throughout last year behav accord   when that rock or energi shock enter the pond in       the core rate of inflat initi spike up but then declin throughout much of the year   energi market threw anoth stone into that inflat pond last year   without those energi shock  my guess is that the  book inflat project for this year would have held up nice  and i think the current project are sensibl  bar ani more ugli suppli shock   that is  i think it is reason to expect that core inflat onc again will drift back down   in the absenc of more rock enter this pond   there is littl evid that unit labor cost are acceler or that price not affect by      energi are problemat   so this give me some comfort with the  book baselin inflat  project   but i recogn that inflat dynam could deliv more persist than that  throughout this polici tighten cycl  i   ve been focus on get the fed fund rate back into the neutral rang   when the pace of econom activ appear to be more robust  i prefer to be in the higher end of that rang   howev  the incom data have made me less certain about aim that high   and it is possibl that the equilibrium real rate of interest could be either notabl higher or lower by the  e of our june meet  for now  i still think that a sequenc of small increment increas in the fed fund rate is the most like cours of action in the immedi futur   nonetheless  greater uncertainti about the outlook for econom activ and inflat   chang my view about how polici decis ought to be communic   in my view  the    measur pace    languag we   ve been use has serv us well   but i think this type of guidanc should be reserv for those period of  e when the committe feel especi confid about what the next few polici action will be and has reason to believ that it intent would be misunderstood without that kind of guidanc   i do not think that these condit are present today   for that reason  i do favor remov the    measur pace    languag   if the statement were reflect my own thought  i would also insert some word that convey a greater sens of uncertainti about the outlook for real growth and inflat and  therefor  more uncertainti about the  e and magnitud of futur polici action   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i   ll start off by repeat the obvious   there have been a coupl of surpris sinc our last fomc meet   the economi has lost momentum after the end of the first quarter  and core inflat has continu to rise   the loss of momentum we saw in march in      the first quarter has led me to join other in mark down my forecast for growth this year to about      percent   i expect growth in the second half of this year to be about    percent and then slow perhap back to     percent next year   with trend growth of about    percent  the output gap and labor market slack should continu to diminish  as we   ve said befor  i would agre with those who attribut much of the slowdown to the persist of higher energi price   this is especi the case for consum spend and confid  as we see it  higher energi cost have also reduc growth in other countri  and i think that probabl has contribut to some of the worsen in our trade balanc  obvious  we need a littl more  e and inform to determin whether the recent econom perform reflect temporari factor or is like to be more perman   if it is temporari  then  as energi price level off or perhap declin somewhat  i would expect the fundament forc of growth to take over   those be monetari polici that  in my opinion  remain accommod and financi condit that are  perhap  high accommod  i   ll digress here by give you just one anecdot   i talk recent to an execut of one of our major bank that lend across the nation in some of the hot market   he describ a condominium deal  a fair larg one  where the construct cost was about      million   the develop had    million of equiti in the project   those who lent     million lent those fund on a pro forma sale price that finish out at      million   so there is a lot of specul  i think  in these market   and that is someth that we have to take into account  but i also see that the labor and capit market that we talk about here are strengthen   so overal i think the evid is that the economi will improv   and i would say  from a region perspect  that the tenth district most provid support for an improv outlook  though i acknowledg that there are issu with respect to energi price   for exampl  consum spend       includ travel and tourism  rose solid in march and earli april  and most retail said sale  were up substanti from a year ago   in addit  hous activ turn up  follow a paus in late      and earli      in our region   hous start and permit rose solid in march  and home sale were strong in most of our district   s citi  still  preliminari data from our manufactur survey suggest some evid of a slowdown  in fact  in april the product and shipment index both fell   more worrisom  though  was the larg declin in the six month ahead product  shipment  and new order index   this bear watch  sinc it may suggest a more perman slowdown than we current expect  in addit  a number of contact express concern to us about higher energi price   for exampl  in our april manufactur survey  some firm said that they were delay shipment in order to assur full truckload and thus save on fuel cost   a few firm also said that they expect to cut back on product due to high energi cost   in addit  some retail were worri that higher gasolin price would eventu take a toll on their sale   of cours  for our region  higher energi price are posit for some of our district   s state  particular oklahoma and wyom  where we see near boom condit  turn to the inflat outlook  i do expect to see further increas in core inflat  with core pce inflat averag almost   percent in      and core cpi inflat averag     percent  similar to the  book forecast   howev  unlik the  book  i expect core inflat to remain elev in      rather than to fall back   i take note of the fact that energi price increas may be a rock in the pond  but i think the substanti accommod monetari polici we have had is more like a boulder   and it is carri itself forward  which is what we need to be awar of and alert to  we continu to see increas in core inflat   whether measur in         or    month period  core cpi and core pce inflat have general been rise this year   moreov  core      inflat is now higher than at ani  e sinc the second half of        in my opinion it is abov  comfort level   measur from six month ago  core cpi inflat is about     percent and core  pce inflat is abov   percent   clear  some of the increas repres temporari factor   such as the energi price we keep talk about and the price of some commod   and may be revers   howev  i would take note that the pass through of energi price to core inflat is difficult to predict  as we talk about earlier  and may be greater than some suggest   i also believ that there is more to the inflat stori than energi price   even if we exclud the two largest quarter rate  core cpi inflat over the last four quarter was   percent  which is signific higher than core inflat over the previous four quarter  i believ some of the increas is the result of our continu accommod polici   we   ve  seen inflat rise over the last year in the presenc of sizabl slack and a rise fund rate   i   m concern that  with less slack in the economi  we will continu to see higher inflat go forward   in addit  maintain an accommod monetari polici pose an upsid risk to inflat  with the feder fund rate current below mani es  of the lower bound of the neutral rate   if we are slow in remov this accommod  i would be concern that the increas in core inflat also might be pass through to higher expect inflat  we   re also see some evid of price power in the tenth district  as manufactur continu to rais their output price to cover what they   ve refer to as rise cost of energi and other input   in addit  the share of our beig book retail contact who report to us that they were rais price this  e was the highest in the last five year  these are my concern   the one other thing i would mention relat to our statement   i would agre with those who would like to abbrevi our statement today   sinc peopl are  in fact  pay attent to the minut  i   d reli on them as our communic method   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the third district continu to improv in the first quarter  although at a slight slower pace than in the previous quarter   retail sale in the region were up slight in march  with most merchant note that unseason cold and raini weather dampen sale of spring apparel and other season merchandis   as in the nation  local auto dealer saw a healthi rebound in sale in march  help by strong manufactur    incent   both retail and auto dealer expect sale to improv this spring  payrol employ continu to increas in the region in the first quarter  and the unemploy rate declin   a larg nation payrol and benefit administr in our district report that in the first quarter employ growth was stronger at small firm with fewer than       employe than at larg firm   but the posit growth rate at larg firm was an improv over the zero growth they saw last year  there has been littl chang in the overal pictur in the construct sector   nonresidenti construct in our region remain soft   as in the nation  there has been a sharp drop in the valu of nonresidenti construct contract in the first quarter compar to a year ago   the residenti sector remain strong   the valu of residenti construct contract declin in the first quarter in our three state region  but remain at a high level   home sale and the rate of hous price appreci remain robust  our busi outlook survey indic that region manufactur activ is expand  we saw a sizabl rebound in the general activ index   from      in march to      in april    suggest that the drop in march may have been a random volatil event rather than a signal of a more persist slow   about half of the firm report that they plan to increas capac in       with the modal increas in the   to    percent rang        the most troubl region econom news is the evid of increas price pressur in the district   consum price in greater philadelphia appear to be increas at a fa  pace than in the nation as a whole   after some moder in februari and march  industri price pressur increas in april   the price index in our manufactur survey rebound this month across almost all of the industri sector repres and are at veri high level   howev  while the index of futur price paid and receiv have risen sharpli over the past two year  in recent month both index have stabil  albeit at relat high level   also  employ cost inflat in the northeast region has not acceler  run at a     percent annual rate in the year that just end in march  in summari  the econom expans appear to continu at a moder pace in the third district   this is what we glean from the data we have avail and it   s consist with the anecdot inform from our contact   dure april  i typic travel around the region  hold a seri of meet with our banker and busi leader   they   re general upbeat  with posit outlook despit the recent negat nation econom headlin   this give me some confid that the recent soft in the data will prove to be relat temporari and is not signal an economi that is take on a new direct  my assess of econom condit in the nation is similar   admit  higher oil price like are have some dampen effect on econom activ  and recent month data have come in softer than expect   howev  this appear to be a temporari lull  as there is littl to point to that suggest we are see a persist deceler in real econom activ   last month was reminisc of the soft patch we hit in june of last year  as presid   indic  after oil price began to rise   you   ll recal that the economi emerg fair quick from that lull        as the expans continu and the economi approach a sustain growth rate  it is to be expect that we will see growth in some quarter abov and in some quarter below that sustain pace   my read of histori suggest that a low quarter or two is fair typic dure the cours of an expans and that some of the concern base on earli measur of econom activ are assuag by subsequ revis in the data   the bottom line is that i agre with the  book   s assess that the economi continu to have posit momentum   this suggest that it is prematur to be too concern that the perceiv slowdown will persist and clear prematur to alter our polici path base upon the avail new data  of cours  there are downsid risk for near term growth  but there is noth that monetari polici can do that will affect the real growth in the next quarter or so   therefor  i think we should be focus on a horizon over which monetari polici can have an effect   in that regard  the acceler in inflat over the past year is a concern to me  and that sen ent has been echo around this tabl   the first part of the increas in inflat was to get us away from the zero bound  but we are now well beyond that   in fact  over the last six month  the inflat rate has been move up into the top half of my accept rang   of cours  these are high frequenc data and the trend still might prove temporari  but it clear deserv watch  the board staff continu to forecast some temper in core inflat over the forecast horizon  but the start level of their forecast have been move up as new data have come in   the forecast downward path seem depend on a good deal of slack remain in the economi  howev  this increas in observ inflat may be evid that there is less slack than we think  by ignor the acceler  we could end up in a situat of have to move rate up more rapid than we now expect  which could have a negat effect on futur growth   so this is certain not the  e to paus in return to more normal level and remov polici accommod        that said  i   ve becom less certain about the particular speed at which the remov of accommod should proceed   if the inflat acceler continu  a steeper path may be indic   in the event that the soften of activ turn out to be persist  a slower pace might be more appropri  at the last meet i indic that i believ the dispers of like rate path go forward was widen   i dare say there was some consensus on this point at the meet   given the recent data  i   d guess that not onli is the dispers around my own expect path wider still but that there is like to be more diverg in the committe   s view of it   thus  i believ it   s import for us to craft our statement in a way that give us consider polici flexibl   it would also be use if we could convey some sens that there is less certainti about polici action go forward  i will not get into the specif of how to do this until the second roundtabl discuss  howev  i want to point out that some  say less offer more transpar about the committe   s view than say more   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with inform from my contact at fedex and up   my contact at fedex say that they   ve seen no indic at all of ani slow  nor do their custom see ani sign of a slowdown   at up  both the ground busi and express busi are come in a bit below plan   part of the stori on the express busi  interest enough  is that the number of mortgag refinanc document they   re ship is way down   laughter   both compani have veri impress expans plan under way   for it fiscal year  begin june    fedex has plan a    percent increas in capit expenditur   that plan actual has been in place for the past six month  and they   ve now done the final budget   up is      hire    to    pilot a month  of whom perhap five are replac pilot for those who are  retir   so  both compani have veri aggress expans plan  my truck industri contact  on the other hand  say that busi is soft   volum is down   percent for april on a year over year basi   the intermod busi is down   percent  april over  april  he note that it was the first declin ever in the intermod busi in the    year histori of the compani   and he say that the declin are widespread across the countri and across industri  my wal mart contact say that same store sale are come in at the low end of expect   he believ the main reason is that the purchas power of those in the part of the incom distribut that shop heavili at wal mart is simpli be drain substanti by high energi price   i think that   s a familiar stori  in almost no case  with scatter except    anyon report ani pressur in the labor market  either on wage or the avail of labor   the except typic are for those with special skill  like account  which we   ve alreadi talk about   anoth job categori that is in short suppli  and has been for a long  e  is truck driver  on the overal economi  i think the recent inflat data   and i   m echo what a lot of other have said   have been on the high side of expect and the output data on the low side of expect   in my view  our uncertainti about the outlook go forward is somewhat greater than it has been   my best guess of a point es    match the  book forecast   i think that   s a good central tendenc  but  as i emphas  my uncertainti on both front has been rise   i think the inflat risk is clear asymmetr on the upper side   i   m not so sure that there   s all that much asymmetri on the output side  the fundament on inflat appear to be sound   we have continu modest wage increas  and we seem to have continu good product growth   financi condit are not      high inflationari  at least as measur by the aggreg   m  growth has been come in below  the growth of nomin gdp  mzm has actual been about flat in the last six month and up   percent year over year   so  on the quantiti side  i don   t think there   s evid of a high expansionari monetari polici   but i think there are lot of reason to be nervous about the inflat risk   i would also point out that one of the clearest indic of the increas uncertainti about the outlook is the length of our discuss about the staff   s forecast   thank you
coffe is avail  so whi don   t we take a break   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   we think the fundament underpin a forecast of a reason strong expans with moder inflat seem reason persuas   howev  we are less confid than we were at the last meet   on the assumpt that we continu to move the fed fund rate higher on a path close to that now in the market  we expect the economi to grow at a     percent rate dure the balanc of this year and in        and we still expect core pce inflat to come in below   percent  although just below  over the balanc of the forecast period  but we think it will follow a somewhat higher path   as this impli  we   re veri close to the  book project on the overal contour of the forecast  and we   re close on the compon as well  we see greater uncertainti in the forecast  with some downsid risk to growth and some upsid risk to inflat   we think the probabl of inflat come in higher is greater than the probabl that growth will be lower   and  of cours  that judgment about the chang in relat probabl is the key to one   s judgment for monetari polici        on the growth front  the anecdot report we   re expos to are weaker than they have been  they   re weaker than the nation number and may impli some further deceler ahead   we don   t have much basi for confid that these number tell us much about the futur  but the sen ent   seem a bit more fragil   the fact that confid seem to have erod so quick in the face of a relat limit period of weaker number might itself suggest greater vulner to the forecast  despit all of this  though  we think the near term fundament of the economi look fair good   the resili of the recent past seem like to be durabl   we think the labor market still look to be on a path of gradual improv   invest growth still seem like to be pretti healthi  with profit margin high  balanc sheet strong  and credit condit favor   we think the factor support solid invest growth remain compel   and we still are inclin to believ that structur product growth is like to remain strong  which should provid both continu impetus to invest and continu confid about futur incom growth   it   s hard to find other constraint out there that could limit the expans   of cours  we still face some risk of an abrupt chang in household save behavior  and the effect of that could be signific  on the inflat front  we   ve been surpris by the extent of the acceler in core price and we are a bit concern about the higher expect reflect in some survey   the economi is grow at a rate that seem like to be suffici to continu to absorb remain slack  unit labor  cost have move up  and we hear continu report of increas price power   and some measur of expect at the intermedi horizon   the horizon over which we expect monetari polici can affect inflat   are abov the desir level of inflat   accord  we see greater risk that inflat will follow a higher path than we are comfort with   this seem a prudent view of the risk to us  despit the comfort we continu to deriv from the fact that compens growth      has been modest to date   profit margin remain veri high  of cours   and despit expect of  fair good futur structur product growth  the modest widen in credit spread and the volatil in equiti price we   ve seen recent have been absorb reason well   i   d be inclin to view this modest repric of risk and uncertainti as welcom and healthi rather than as foreshadow a deeper  more protract deceler  on balanc  we believ that monetari polici should continu to be direct at move the real fed fund rate higher   at our last meet we introduc a bit more uncertainti into the monetari polici signal by put in more qualif about the like path of monetari polici go forward and about the cumul amount of tighten   the overal effect of these chang to our statement was to continu to signal that we think the slope of the fund rate path remain posit  impli  of cours  that monetari polici is still too accommod   but we also indic  through these chang to this statement  that we have less certainti about the slope and shape of that path  long term measur of inflat expect moder immedi follow the meet  and some measur of uncertainti about futur rate went up   and sinc then  market particip have demonstr a veri signific degre of sensit to incom data   at least in term of the fed fund path price into the market   to me this suggest that we got the balanc about right last   e   we bought ourselv the desir increas in flexibl to respond to a somewhat more uncertain set of condit go forward  and i think we should tri to preserv that balanc in our  signal today   we need to acknowledg  of cours  the moder in the rate of growth in output and demand we   ve seen and the higher inflat number  but i don   t see a good reason to tri to alter in either direct the expect for the path of the fed fund rate go forward        the increas uncertainti in the market about the forecast reflect some greater dispers in the like path of the fed fund rate  and i think it suggest littl gap between the market   s view and our own view of polici uncertainti go forward   so i don   t see a case for alter the statement signific today in a way that would introduc a greater degre of uncertainti about monetari polici than is alreadi reflect in the market at this point   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   unfortun  the econom and polici situat becam a lot more interest over the intermeet period   we thought we had an emerg inflat problem  the issu was how hard to lean against it   in the event  core inflat did come in a bit to the high side  but  in addit  econom activ was appreci weaker than i thought it would be  with both consumpt and invest fall short of expect  a greater than expect reaction to previous increas in energi price seem to me the most like culprit for both the inflat and output surpris   perhap the constrain reaction last summer and fall to the previous run up in energi price lure us into give this factor too littl weight   peopl may not chang their behavior until price have been high for some  e and they perceiv the need to build them into more perman notion of relat price and dispos incom   busi  in cut back their hire and capit outlay  may be react to their percept that energi price were in the process of take a bigger piec out of household spend or at least to increas uncertainti about the path of that spend  the tendenc for econom activ to be disappoint in sever industri economi in recent month support the notion of a common global thread and is consist with the energi price explan   and on the price side  cost pass through may be easier and more readili accept by custom when everybodi is subject to a similar shock        i agre with the contour of the staff forecast   if energi price remain flat  growth should pick up and core inflat should abat   we   re most like look at a downward adjust in the level of demand and an upward adjust in the level of aggreg price  not more persist effect on growth rate   fundament continu to favor this outcom   financi condit remain quit accommod and support of growth suffici to resum narrow the output gap  foreign demand should also strengthen  as the energi price shock is absorb  the damp growth of compens even in the face of higher headlin inflat indic to me that appreci slack remain in labor market   capac util in manufactur is still below it long run averag   in this environ  condit in labor and product market should help keep a lid on price increas  but the incom data have elev the level of uncertainti about the outlook  as mani of us have remark  and rais question about what account for the recent outcom and suggest skew around this most like scenario  it   s difficult to identifi what  other than energi price  could be unexpect damp demand   but confid has erod  which could intensifi and prolong energi relat shortfal  we can see the declin in confid in survey of household and small busi that we saw ye day and also in financi market  where volatil and risk spread have risen and stock price have fallen   perhap market are better align with realiti  but financi condit are a littl tighter than they have been  and this will restrain spend at least slight go forward   the slowdown in the increas in invest spend is especi notabl and would be a concern if it were prolong  sinc that   s what most of us were count on to sustain solid growth and declin slack over the next few quarter  the staff has interpret the recent shortfal as reflect in some small part more persist weak in demand than would be simpli associ with an adjust to higher energi price       high frequenc data  such as initi claim  and earli indic of consum demand in april  suggest that the economi continu to expand at a moder pace   but at the least  the recent data point to a greater possibl than i saw at the last meet that growth will not be suffici to rais resourc util as polici accommod is remov further  on inflat  the declin in both short  and long run inflat compens and in financi market sinc the last meet encourag me to think that energi price increas aren   t be propag through this mechan   but the surpris in the core inflat number do suggest some continu risk that inflat won   t be as contain as one might otherwis have expect at given level of resourc util  the puzzl here in my view is the charact of the competit environ   given slack in resourc util and high profit margin  i would have expect busi to have been driven   by competit and desir to expand market share   to absorb more of the cost increas  but busi clear remain cautious about expans  and they have been abl to rais price to maintain veri high price markup  from a polici perspect  i think we have a situat that is a bit more balanc than it was at the last meet   financi condit still seem too accommod to be consist with the economi not overshoot the level of it potenti onc the effect of rise energi price wear off  we need to be care that nomin rate keep ahead of the now slight higher under inflat  but a gradual pace of tighten now seem an even better guess than it might have been at the previous meet  in the sens of be in the center of a distribut of possibl rate path   and that   s becaus a less robust economi and a larger output gap than expect should provid some greater assur that inflat will remain contain as we rais rate at a measur pace        as i tri to suggest  i think the distribut around the outcom for inflat and output have becom more skew  but in offset direct with regard to their implic for polici  as we   ve been say in our minut and speech  how the actual path of rate evolv will depend on the data and how some of these puzzl are resolv   but for now i would keep on our path  and i would let the public know that that   s still our best guess for how we   ll be proceed   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the short run monetari choic are get harder   while the world oil market is suffer a demand shock caus by rapid growth in china and elsewher  it affect the economi as a suppli shock  with simultan worsen of inflat and unemploy   mani of us live through just the revers of this in the late     s  with simultan improv in inflat and unemploy   for us  turnabout is fair play   but while it may be fair play  the choic get harder     one look at the inflat number and tighten up or at the unemploy number and loosen up   the answer depend  i think  on whether the medium term impact on inflat or unemploy is like to be stronger and more pervas  as the number came in over the past six week  initi i was on the hawkish side  worri that inflat would come loos from it moor   in term of     s bluebook rhetor chart  exhibit     i found myself over in column c somewher look for way to tighten the statement to express more inflat concern   but as  e went on  the drib and drab of steadili worsen data have shift me over to where i am now  which is somewher in column a  want to eas our rhetor moder   given the enorm amount of accommod polici that we have put in and our fair elabor telegraph oper  it is too late to actual paus in our rate increas at this      meet   and i guess i   ve been to too mani meet of this sort to suggest major chang in our  rhetor    laughter  but i would like to lobbi for at least some element of column a in the statement   the reason for my chang should be fair appar   as the  book note  the spend data have been consist weak over the last six week   the first quarter gdp report was below expect in a way that is like to last   not onli was gdp overes   but final sale were overes  by even more   so the futur forecast should be scale down to reflect the lower final sale momentum and perhap addit becaus there might be someth of an inventori overhang  in term of spend compon  there has alway been a likelihood that consumpt growth would slow as person save rate keep drop to histor low   and it was alway like that save rate would revert to more normal  higher level  slow consumpt growth  the wealth   incom ratio was held up by hous price  and it  too  could revert to more normal level  further slow consumpt growth   consum confid has been drop for a while now   on the whole  it is quit reason to project that consumpt will grow less than incom for the next few quarter  repress incom growth  fiscal polici appear to be rough neutral over the forecast horizon   i note that the congress did pass a budget agreement that seem to contain at least moder fiscal tighten  whether this fiscal tighten will actual come to pass is still an open question  but we will  probabl not get much new demand impetus from the fiscal side or from the foreign side   some part of the world are grow well  but mani of our trade partner are experienc slowdown of their own  henc  slacken export growth is like   the dollar drop may help  but if the dollar      declin sharpli  there may be enough disloc around the world that export growth could still  sputter  this mean that over the medium term unusu import attach to capit invest   in the staff   s own word  in the data report we got  busi fix invest rose at a rate    well below    that in the fourth quarter     spend on equip and softwar deceler and spend on nonresidenti structur declin      i might add that durabl good order are down sharpli  hous start are down  and the ism  institut for suppli manag  index of factori activ is down   the stock market is sluggish despit pretti decent earn report  and measur of small busi confid have plummet  even though this is a lot of data  i do think it   s too soon to tell if there   s a pattern here  but it wasn   t so long ago that we were worri about an invest pothol   mayb we just got the  e of that a littl wrong  with sluggish aggreg macro  e seri  that can easili happen  i think   or there could be some other sourc of impend weak in invest   it seem as if around this tabl about everi eight month we get worri about a lack of corpor anim spirit   i don   t know what the answer is  but i do think that  if invest flag  there is no other obvious sourc of spend strength   grant  as gari say  the economi has shown a lot of resili  but the spend still has to come from somewher  as i said befor  it is intrins difficult to conduct monetari polici when both object are turn the wrong way  but in the medium run i   m go to differ with mani of you in at least rais the possibl that the weak spend data may trump the strong price data   mani of the price increas seem to be one shot increas due to energi shock and unlik to pass through into continu inflat   we talk about the core index  but the core index  sn   t purg all influenc of energi  and i   m a littl suspici that some of the taint are  if you will  energi taint   i think it   s      import to keep our eye on wage  and wage have continu to be moder  indic that price  pressur do seem to be contain for the longer run   and as mani of us have note over  e  if aggreg demand   weaken  output gap will fail to close and overal price pressur should wane  so what should we do about all of this   in the short run  i   ll go with the crowd   we have invest so much in advertis a climb in rate that we can   t back down now   for the medium run  howev  i   m begin to get worri on the negat side   at this meet  i would like to shade our rhetor toward the a column in the bluebook   i guess the onli other thing i could say is that i   d like to recommend that over the next six or eight week everybodi studi care the simul that the staff label  sen ent slump with financi spillov     laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for this meet  i talk with contact at two larg bank   as all of us are awar  bank asset qualiti throughout all of      and      continu improv to the point where by the end of last year almost all banker said in their year end report that asset qualiti cannot get better  it has to get wors   thus far  the announc that have been made in the first quarter indic that asset qualiti did get better   but i suspect that some of the banker are look at the debt spread inform and are ask themselv the same question that dino pose rhetor   is there someth behind the data that we need to know   and both banker that i talk to independ believ   becaus they   re in an environ of intens pressur on price and underwrit standard and in a situat with signific liquid   that the margin credit may  in fact  be rewritten   they are circul  so we have a slight game of music chair go on with margin credit   so  with bank asset qualiti  we do not yet see the declin as we do with some of the debt spread  but it may be lurk out there       that said  it is not signific becaus  with the veri strong perform of corpor america in  recent year  there is still veri littl in the way of troubl asset out there  particular in c i loan  with respect to today   s meet  as i read the bluebook and the  book inform  i was struck by the signific contrast with the last meet   i was prepar to speak to that in a substant way until both   and   summar in about three sentenc what i would have said in mani more   so i don   t need to go in that direct  but what i was not prepar to speak to until i came in to today   s meet was the fact that when i compar the beig book report and the comment of the reserv bank presid  there is not near the wide varianc that i note in the bluebook or the  book   now  if the inform that we gather in washington is cumul data that we were abl to pick up  albeit with a lag  and we supplement that with the more contemporan data that we get from the presid  it seem to me that there ought to be a lesson there   at least we ought to focus on it   in the three and a half year that i have been on this committe  i don   t rememb the inform alway be ident  but i never rememb the beig book inform lag the  book data   so i suspect that we may be closer to a pothol or perhap even the head fake that the entir chicago bull went for last night when juan dixon went up for his jump shot  which he made consist
that   s unfair    laughter
it has been    year  michael   it has been a long  e   i   m inclin to support those of you who have alreadi spoken to the strength of the under fundament and who believ the output gap is continu to close slight   i think we clear communic in the last meet   and the market interpret it correct   our heighten concern about the level of inflat   with respect to the like direct of the under economi       i think the inform is suffici contradictori or unclear that it is difficult to make a posit  statement  howev  we may choos to do as susan and roger and i did in our announc with respect to the basel ii qis   quantit impact studi  inform   some of you may know that as we were look at the qis  data  which involv the studi of the impact of the new basel ii accord on the bank  we decid that either the inform reflect a wider dispar of risk exposur or that there were some addit fundament inconsist in the under data that would requir us to postpon the releas of our notic of propos rulemak   so we did that  that we simpli postpon  actual  would be my first choic for today    laughter   sinc that is not realli be an appropri option for us  i would suggest that we not signific revis the manner in which we have communic our view regard the remov of polici accommod until we get a clearer sens of what the under data are tell us
thank you  mr  chairman   i guess i   m go to repeat a lot of the thing that other have said  but i think i will end up in a somewhat differ place than some of you around the tabl in that i   m much more concern about the risk of inflat than i am about those for the real economi  if we look at the first quarter data  and more particular the inform that has come out in the last sever week  we can realli see that the quarter start out veri strong and that the more recent data show some weak   first quarter gdp growth at     percent was much weaker than most folk  myself includ  expect   but if one look at the compon of the under data  they show that the weak in the first quarter was primarili in net export   particular due to the      surg in import   and in govern spend   in fact  privat domest final sale were realli  quit good in the quarter  grow by my rough es  at somewher in the high   percent rang  so how do we deal with that   well  to the extent that the weak is import and is come from strong consum and busi spend  that   s a good sign   so  while i want to get some more data on what is happen in the real economi  i   m not as pessimist as some of you   monetari polici is still accommod  if one look at the liquid in the bank system   and while the weaker econom data caus some reaction in financi market  overal the condit are veri support of busi expans and consum borrow   corpor profit for the first quarter  which are still come in  seem to show continu strength  and first quarter earn growth now look as if it will be in doubl digit for the twelfth straight quarter  to me the other remark develop in the market is what has happen in reaction to news about complianc with sarban oxley   this is the first year end report   most compani are on a calendar year end  and a record number of compani have announc that they cannot report in the regular  e frame and are do late file   normal  one would expect this to creat a disrupt in the market  but the market has been veri discern in the way it has taken the news  mani compani that have report have had to disclos weak in their intern control around financi report   and base just on the anecdot evid  the market seem to be behav veri prudent in that it is distinguish between compani where the report weak are isol in one small area and those where the control weak are more pervas   so  it appear that the sunshin associ with these disclosur is be handl well in the marketplac   we   ll see what happen as we go along and those firm that have still to disclos their sarban oxley report do so   i was a littl concern that we might see more volatil in the market as a result of these report  but that worri has been disappear in the last few week        let me turn now to the inflat issu  which   have me more concern   if we look at the lag indic  inflat number over the last    month are still in the mid   percent rang  depend on what measur we look at   but one of the thing we need to realiz is that in the first part of last year inflat rate were veri  veri low    if i look instead at inflat measur in the first quarter compar to the fourth quarter  i get veri much concern about the trend we   re see   if i throw out all of the volatil energi and food compon  the way we typic do  and look at core measur  core cpi has risen by     percentag point to     percent in the last three month   core pce is up a full point to     percent  as to where we see price rise  the big turnaround  as some of you have indic  has been in the good sector of the market   price for servic continu to be rise by a bit abov   percent  but good price have gone from declin at an almost   percent pace at the begin of last year to be about unchang now   that is affect the aggreg number and is someth we need to watch   the employ cost index in the first quarter did show a slight slow to     percent from     percent in the fourth quarter   but as   remark  this is due to the slowdown in pension fund that occur in the first quarter  a recent survey of corpor cfos show that their number one concern continu to be health care cost   and as they look to pay for the cost of labor go forward  mani of them are tri to hold down wage increas becaus of the signific rise they   re see in health care cost  where this will lead in term of futur hire is a concern   it may impact the real economi  becaus if employ growth continu at the more subdu pace of the last month  it could affect consumpt and the real final sale that are give me confid in the real sector   as for the balanc of risk  i agre with the comment presid   made  i believ the risk of inflat are now clear on the upsid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   like everyon els  i   ve note with some concern both the incom evid of a soft patch with respect to growth and a rough patch with respect to inflat   howev  i also believ that the  book has taken these incom data on board with the usual wisdom and aplomb that i would expect from the staff   i  therefor  think i can easili support the baselin as be a reason basi for policymak today  have said that  i   m also quit certain that the baselin will be wrong  i just don   t know in which direct   as mani have alreadi point out  the rang of risk is realli quit larg   i would say that if one look at the altern simul  one can see mani of the element of those risk   given the fact that i   m the last speaker  i will not go through a recit of the data   instead  i   m go to move to the implic of that  first  i think the outcom of today   s meet is in some sens a foregon conclus  anyth other than a move of    basi point would be folli  and i don   t think we want to go down that path   second  with respect to what we say today  a number of peopl have rais some question about whether or not we should keep the word    measur    in our descript   frank  given the rang of uncertainti that we are face now  to do anyth other than to say that polici will be move at a measur pace  i think  would creat more uncertainti than certainti   so inertia in term of the languag might well be a smart move  think beyond that  though  to the rest of this year and focus a bit more on strategi  i note that the market have now mark down their expect of where the fed fund rate will be toward the end of the year and much of next year to a number close to      percent as oppos to   percent   that lead me to think about exact what has been drive the unusu data we have seen come in   here i pick up a point that the  book rais   the writer hypothes that there are      two reason for the soft in the recent data  one is higher energi price  and the second is that the  tighten of monetari polici may have taken a greater toll on the economi than we had anticip  mani have alreadi explor the energi price issu and it implic for inflat   let me now go to the other side  which is the question of whether or not the tighten of monetari polici has had a greater toll on the economi than we had expect   this obvious is anoth way of say that the equilibrium real interest rate is somewhat lower than we might have thought previous  and i   d like to explor that possibl  i think the market clear have the view that the equilibrium rate or the neutral rate may have come down somewhat   the bluebook tabl indic that the tip consist measur on a  core pce basi would put the medium run equilibrium real rate at about    percent   obvious  we cannot observ the rate that would be call for to keep the economi grow at potenti without inflationari pressur  but perhap we can approxim this unobserv by look at the long run averag   the averag real rate dure the period      to      was about    percent   thus  the market seem to be signal that the equilibrium real rate has come down to a level about    basi point below what it was in the last decad     in his remark indic that there is obvious a wide band of confid around that  but it may be somewhat lower as well as potenti somewhat higher  so let   s look at the question of whi the rate might be lower or whi it is that the market and the  book might be right to suggest that the trajectori for the rate might be somewhat lower than we had thought earlier   i think we all know the litani  the restraint impos on domest consum from the increas in the cost of energi  the linger hesit of busi to make commit  and the drag on domest product from the excess of import over export   all      these factor repres forc that are pull the equilibrium rate down below it perceiv long  term rate  so what are the fact   first  with respect to the first explan on energi price  the staff ye day show us a simul that indic that the run up in oil price sinc decemb      may have taken    percentag point off growth in      and   percentag point off growth this year  i have noth to add to the simul  but it clear suggest that there is some damp of domest demand that   s come from these high and consist high energi price  let   s go to the second point  which is the issu of busi hesit   it   s certain true that equip and softwar spend has been grow relat strong   howev  by histor standard  both nomin high tech and non high tech e s  equip and softwar  expenditur as a share of gdp are somewhat lower than averag   i don   t have the exact number  but as a rough approxim it seem as though non high tech spend has account for somewher between     and   percent of gdp sinc       and now account for someth lower   close to about   percent  high tech spend has also been trend up for some  e  but perhap it should be about    percent of gdp now and it   s actual about    percent   these are obvious rough es   but they all suggest that there has been a linger drag on invest follow the     s  the third explan for whi the real equilibrium rate may be somewhat lower  obvious  is the drag from trade   that topic has alreadi been well discuss   i won   t add much more except to say that in a recent discuss with the ecb  european central bank   their policymak seem to have some concern that the risk to their econom growth are primarili to the downsid  suggest that we should not expect a pickup in demand for our export oversea  so the question then becom this   if  inde  the market are right and we are closer to the end than to the begin of our move toward the equilibrium rate  what happen if we get all of this      wrong   i realiz i   m tri to do someth here that gari suggest we can   t do  which is to   achiev a brilliant polici  exquisit execut   but if we aren   t abl to achiev that  what happen  i ask the staff to run a rough simul from frb us to see what would happen if we continu to rais rate    basi point today and at each of the follow four meet   in june  august  septemb  and novemb   that simul suggest that we would wind up at the end of      with real gdp growth down at about     percent  the unemploy rate would have risen to about     percent  and core pce inflat would have fallen to     percent versus the     percent in the  book baselin   i don   t have a longer run forecast  but i would expect that over a longer  e horizon we   d find inflat trail off even more  the reason i   ve gone through the simul is to suggest that as we think about the rest of this year  we should probabl take on board the fact that while we have to continu to tighten   as both the market and the  book suggest   this concept of measur pace is veri  veri import  and the issu of exact when and where we stop is also quit import   to put it anoth way  while i   m comfort with the strategi for today  i think we   re realli enter the neutral zone  and for those of you who are star trek fan  you may recal that when you enter the neutral zone that   s when the alien are most like to attack    laughter  it is quit clear to me that we have execut one exit strategi  but unfortun i think we   re enter a mode where we need a new exit strategi from the exit strategi    laughter
mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that were distribut dure the coffe break   market particip see today as anoth step in your journey of remov polici  accommod   as shown in the upper left panel  futur price and survey respons indic that a   point firm today is a lock  as is the retent in the    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix           statement of the judgment that the risk to both of your object are balanc  some doubt  howev  have surfac about whether the    measur pace    languag will surviv the day   one in four of the respond to survey by the desk and by blue chip think not    market view about your action today were essenti settl by your march statement   as the solid line in the top right panel show  the may feder fund futur contract has trade at about   percent over the entir intermeet period  but investor also appar understood that your action in come quarter depend on econom prospect  as they revis down the fund rate expect at year   end  the dot line  about   point   or about as much as the staff has assum in it baselin    some of the twist and turn of that path owe to committe statement   as can be seen in the middl left panel  the announc releas after your march meet was view as hawkish about inflat and prompt the largest swing in the two year treasuri note yield in the window surround      p m  in the past year  the red bar    some of that was taken back by the more nuanc descript of your deliber provid in the minut of that meet releas three week later   note that onli the last three pair of bar cover the new regim of expedit public of the minut     as can be seen by the bar in the upper of the two panel at the middl right  the two year yield rose in the window bracket major econom data releas  as increas follow data on fa  than expect consum price inflat more than offset the chang spark by spend  product  and employ releas with a surpris soft cast   that latter inform  along with well public problem at a few promin corpor and declin in equiti price  sour market sen ent about the vigor of the econom expans   and as can be seen in the panel just below  intraday movement in the two year note yield were high correl with those of the s p        as shown in the lower left panel  equiti price shed     percent on net over the intermeet period  and risk spread on debt instrument widen   tripl b yield  the solid line in the middl panel  edg lower  but specul grade yield  the dot line  actual rose   with the valu of the dollar appreci slight on foreign exchang market  the lower right panel   financi condit like tighten on net    if you believ that these financi condit   which are predic on market expect of polici action today and more to follow   will preserv satisfactori econom expans while contain inflat  you probabl would be comfort with move the feder fund rate to   percent this afternoon   no doubt  the staff   s assess of the econom outlook  as summar in the upper panel of exhibit    has move in an unsatisfactori direct  with the output gap  at the left  narrow       more gradual than in the previous forecast  and core pce inflat  at the right  run along a slight higher path   this fit the bill of an advers suppli shock  like at least in part the product of sustain higher oil price   in effect  higher inflat   and probabl upsid risk to inflat   act as a constraint limit how fast slack can be work down   as a result and as mani of you have note  the polici menu avail to you look dourer than it did six week ago    in that brave new world of diminish possibl  a   point increas in the nomin fund rate would help prevent an eros in the real fund rate  as the result of the upcreep in inflat and perhap short term inflat expect  and might even close a littl of the distanc of the actual real rate  the solid line in the middl panel  with es  of it equilibrium  the swath of red     take as given the wisdom of the crowd about polici expect  the issu isn   t whether you will tighten by   point  but whether you will signal a slower  unchang  or quicker pace of firm go forward in the word that accompani that action   the staircas plot in blue in the bottom left panel consid a futur in which you tighten    basi point at upcom meet for as far as the eye can see   that path is not built into market   the expect feder fund rate  the dark solid line  veer to the south of the staircas and flatten out  impli the expect of an end to this cycl of firm   look at the read along the vertic line denot year end  an expect feder fund rate of     percent add up to two more   point increas in the final five meet of         the same structur of expect fund rate can be describ as averag over differ branch of the probabl tree in which the committe tighten   point at each meet until it stop for good   the distribut of stop  e  given at the lower right  show that current futur quot are consist with   weight given to the fund rate be on hold start in june and a six in ten chanc prevail that you will be done at some point befor the end of this year    the argument for paus some  soon are laid out in exhibit     in particular  as seen by the posit of a nomin feder fund rate of   percent plot as the solid line in the upper left panel  standard polici rule most call for someth south of that target   as shown in the two panel at the upper right  polici rule agre that the nomin fund rate this quarter should be higher than the averag of the first quarter   you   d be more comfort with a fund rate at the level of   percent if your inflat goal is a     percent annual increas in the core pce  the upper right panel  than if your inflat goal is   percent  as note direct below    hold the fund rate at   percent for some  e would have ad appeal if you view spend as potenti prone to a negat confid shock that could spill over to financi market  perhap as spell out in one of the altern simul in the  book that turn out to be a favorit of governor    as shown in the middl panel  in that simul the unemploy rate end the       forecast period   percentag point higher than the baselin  and core pce inflat move back into the territori where    unwelcom disinfl    was onc a serious concern   moreov  a signal that polici would be on hold might not provok particular concern on the part of market particip given that employ compens  the lower left panel  remain subdu and inflat expect  the lower right panel  general seem well anchor    for some of you  such reason may sound uncomfort like an echo of argument made    year ago  just at the point where peopl around this tabl made serious mistak   core pce inflat  the solid line in the upper panel of exhibit    is run well abov the central tendenc of your forecast for this year made just three month ago   and at    percent  as in the middl left panel  the unemploy rate is within spit distanc of most es  of it natur rate   in addit  as at the middl right  product growth has slow  perhap suggest that less restraint on unit labor cost will be provid in come quarter   with such an outlook  you might be justifi in want to pick up the pace of firm some  soon    inde  as shown in the bottom panel  both the spot price of west texa intermedi crude  the solid line  and far ahead futur price for that resourc  the dot line  have move up decid  impli that more of the    excis tax    an import depend countri such as our must pay is perman  presum to the detriment of spend and the economi   s potenti to produc and pose the risk that inflat expect will pick up   put greater weight on the reduct in suppli associ with this run up in energi price   which includ both a possibl deterior in inflat sen ent as well as longer run effect on potenti output   presum would inclin member to want to project a firmer stanc of polici    a use start point for your discuss of the polici statement might be the one you issu in march  which i have includ as exhibit     in previous meet and in comment on the earli draft of potenti statement i distribut last week  some of you express a clear prefer for elimin forward look languag from the announc   it is import to recogn  howev  that the forward look content come in two flavor  one explicit and one implicit   the committe character it futur polici action in the next to last sentenc  which is type in red   this is a relat explicit messag  in that the committe forecast both the direct and the like pace of it futur action   the implicit forecast is type in blue   as long as you assert that polici is accommod against the backdrop of a general posit depict of the economi  reader will infer that you intend to rais rate over  e   this open up the two possibl for alter the statement to enhanc your flexibl that were discuss under altern c in the bluebook   you could be asymmetr and trim the explicit descript of your futur action   the red type       languag about    a pace that is like to be measur      but leav the part where you describ polici as accommod   reader will like view that chang as give the committe the scope to tighten more quick than previous expect  altern  you could excis all guidanc  both the red and the blue  on the notion that the chang would indic symmetri about the possibl path for polici   whatev may be the merit of a statement that   not restrict your rang of futur action  the current situat may make you will to toler the status quo for a bit longer   the expans probabl seem less vigor and more uncertain to you now than it did six week ago  and you might be concern that an advers market reaction to an asymmetr statement without the    measur pace    languag could further dent the economi   s momentum   but despit the recent hesit in spend and product  you   re like to view a   percent nomin fund rate as still accommod   thus  it risk mislead the public to remov that sens under a  symmetr approach to elimin forward look languag   if you share that apprais  you probabl would favor  even if reluct  altern b of tabl     which is repeat for conveni as the last exhibit
question for mr  reinhart
i have just one question on the inflat swap quot   you talk a littl bit about them when you first introduc them in februari   how good are those data   is that market deep   are the quot indic   are they real transact quot   i   m just curious  it   s intrigu stuff
it   s materi that was in the last bluebook  and it is repeat again in this one  where we talk about the chang in forward look inflat compens   in fact  the inflat swap market develop most in europ   that   s where the market is deeper  in part becaus in europ appar there are particip on both side of that trade   main util that have legisl rate and  therefor  are will to pay for get that protect  in the unit state  the volum of trade has increas over the last year or so  and we do think that it is a use market   one my i in that market  which still prevail  is that at least at the front part of the tip yield curv and the inflat swap yield curv  there   s a bit of an arbitrag opportun   dealer we talk to say that  yes  they know it exist  but to exploit it would involv      basic exploit their custom  and they are reluct to do that while the market is still limit   it hasn   t deepen enough
i have a comment on process   i appreci the earlier distribut of tabl    which is a procedur we decid on at the last meet   on reflect  i   d like to regist some reserv about it   it has the effect of shift substant deliber out of the committe  and it prevent us as committe member from benefit from the reason and thought of our colleagu on the fomc   we don   t know what other member are communic dure the period lead up to the meet   i   m not sure exact the right way to get around this  and i hope we can revisit this topic some  soon   but one possibl would be to have member submit their suggest chang to tabl   in write   then  after the close of some suitabl comment period  the staff could distribut those suggest so that we could glean what peopl are think when they suggest chang to the languag rather than have to revers engin via exegesi
certain some progress can be made in that direct  but let   s be care not to bring it to the tabl at this point in the meet  becaus the length of the discuss is indetermin  and we still have our      deadlin   therefor  i think it   s critic that whatev we do with respect to enhanc the interact on the word of the statement be done befor the meet   and the internet  especi e mail appropri encrypt  is a rather signific vehicl that can readili be employ if the member perceiv that there is inadequ interact on the statement itself   in my view  that can fair easili be improv upon  if necessari  and i think   is the central point here   so i would suggest that those of you who agre with      presid   communic that  or indic to   that you think the current process is  perfect adequ  which i alway find a difficult posit to support
i would note with some ironi  mr  chairman  that in the decemb      memo that introduc the balanc of risk languag  it was taken for grant   i think this was on the first page   that draft languag for the statement would not be circul befor the meet becaus it had the potenti to stifl the discuss at the meet   so  the view of the committe have chang in this regard   i would say it   s an open issu of where the pendulum is now relat to perpendicular   i welcom everybodi   s comment   i look forward to those e mail   and one possibl  if there   s enough interest  is that we can figur out when to have a committe discuss
you know  there   s a differ from five year ago   the differ basic is that the general notion that we can all come here  sit down and have a discuss in a limit number of hour  and in that period come up with a consensus on the best word for our statement  has proven fals   it   s a much more detail deliber  there   s far more involv than mere a statement of where the fund rate is go to be   what we are learn is that the process requir a great deal of deliber prior to the meet   so  even though we offici meet onli on fix day  the amount of interact in the intermeet period is increas   it   s larg  of cours  as a consequ of a statement that is ever more elabor   i think we   re find that the old notion about not discuss in advanc what our view are   that we should just come to the tabl and work them out   would be fine if we had an open end  e frame  which we don   t  we issu a statement at      p m  on the day of our meet   so  unless we want to chang that  which has a lot of consequ  we have to recogn that a good part of what we discuss and conclud has to result from our pre meet discuss        now  to the extent that you wish to enhanc the amount of interact among member  there clear are vehicl to do that which we do not at this stage employ   there has to be an ul  arbit  and it still has to be   in one way or anoth  becaus it is conceiv  if we are all interact and not take vote  that we could have a stalem   and a stalem is not permiss in this committe  becaus we have to come to conclus   so  we can move to a greater degre of interact  if you choos   and i think that can be done veri readili  especi with the marvel advanc in technolog that have emerg in the last five year
mr  chairman  i was go to rais this point later  or mayb at anoth meet  but i think it   s consist with the discuss we   re have   i would hope that we don   t foreclos the possibl  long term  of rethink this entir process   it seem backward to me to be tri to work on the statement befor we have the benefit of a committe discuss in which we hear each other   s view   i don   t think we can replic that in one on one discuss  don  you know far better than i do the process at the bank of england  but bob eisenbei and i had occas to visit there  and i believ their process still involv a meet that encompass two day   they meet one day to talk about their view on the econom outlook and on polici  they spend the next day talk about what to do and how to describ it   it seem to me that this work is import enough that at some point   again  not today   we might want to reconsid the whole process   if we to want to craft these kind of statement  they may be better done by the committe after we   ve had our discuss about the economi and polici   i just hope we wouldn   t rule that out as a possibl somewher down the road
if a larg enough proport of this membership agre with that statement  it   s an obvious topic for one of our upcom two day meet   the fact that the      bank of england   it is not  in and of itself  a recommend    laughter   further question for     if not  let me get start   presid   rais an interest point  which i have been mean to rais  and i   d just like to repeat it   one of the thing we have succeed in do through all of this confus is to communic to the marketplac what our relat prioriti are   the market now pretti much anticip how we   re go to respond to various event or develop in advanc of their occurr  and the market has been relat accur   in other word  we come to this tabl and we find that  lo and behold  expect of the feder fund rate go forward are not all that differ from the general judgment of this group  even though that judgment may have chang signific from the previous period  so  while there are problem   and in fact  we have an eight week spread between meet in a period of increas uncertainti   i   m not sure i care all that much   i think the market will do our work for us until we come and sit at this tabl and formal it   so  that take away one of the problem that i think we have had   and i believ we would be well advis  if we can somehow manag to do so  to continu to convey to the marketplac where our prioriti are and what is like to caus them to chang   i say that becaus to me there is certain an under valu to maintain as littl reaction to our post meet statement as possibl  with the except of when we veri deliber want to chang market sen ent   inde  last meet we did wish to do that  we actual want to confront the issu that spread were get too narrow and that there was a degre of complac in the market   so the statement was chang in a manner that pretti much indic that we were slight more concern than the market had anticip   and we got a fair signific reaction  as exhibit by the veri big blue spike in     s chart   but that   s the except        we should endeavor whenev we can to make the      p m  announc subsequ to these meet as unev as possibl in most case   in this context  i think we need to consid the fact that the market are essenti say that we are go to paus in some of our subsequ meet   now  it   s one thing to forecast that we   re go to paus  but it   s quit anoth to actual do so   the paus can aris in two way   one  we can liter stipul that we are not go to act in the current meet but are like to act at the next meet   we   ve never tri that   i think we   ll have consider difficulti formul languag that essenti say     we know enough at this moment not to move the fund rate  but we know someth that suggest that we are go to move it six week from now  or whenev the next meet is      i would find it veri difficult to craft such a statement with credibl  as a consequ  i think what is like to happen is that we will continu to increas rate until we actual come to what we perceiv to be the end   howev  it may veri well be that it is not the end and that in later period we will move   henc  that will valid what the market are say   that we will paus onli becaus we didn   t get it right and not becaus a paus was part of our polici program   that  to me  will almost sure be the case  becaus  as histori tell us   in fact  it   s a clich around this committe   at the end of a process of either tighten or eas  the last move is a mistak   the challeng basic is to put ourselv into a posit  when we make that mistak  where the probabl of our creat a signific disrupt is minim  this lead us to the question that we near alway confront  which governor   rais indirect earlier   most of the  e we have to ask ourselv   if we take a particular action and it prove to be a mistak  is it more cost than take the presum altern action and  have that turn out to be a mistak        for exampl  we   re confront current with the issu of choos to paus or make a signific chang in the statement on the one hand  or of continu with a move of    basi point  and keep the word    measur    without signific chang the statement on the other    if we choos the first   either paus or make a signific chang in the statement   and that prove wrong  in my judgment that will creat a more signific problem for us than if we presum that  inflat is the more critic ongo problem  go    basi point  and maintain the languag from  our last meet    if we do the latter and we are wrong  it will be far easier to recov from that than to recov from have made a statement which presuppos that inflat is under control and have that prove to be wrong   so  i think we   re get ever closer to where we   re eventu go to stop  and we   ll be make decis of this natur until we come to the conclus that the argument for move anoth    basi point cannot be sustain  i happen to think that the current situat is again like to prove to be a soft patch   there are certain aspect of it that are not consist with an actual turn point in the busi cycl  inde  if it is the begin of a cyclic downturn  it will be one of the most extraordinarili rare event in busi histori  basic becaus profit margin are still rise   i don   t recal a situat in which the economi liter turn down  unless there is a financi crash  with profit margin at their peak   in fact  i don   t recal a financi crash with profit margin at their peak   there are usual long lag and deterior  but we haven   t start to see that yet  the deterior that i think is out there involv a slowdown in product and  by implic  a rise in unit labor cost   but we   re assum that to be mute  larg becaus wage are consid to be grow at a fair stabl pace   inde  if anyth  a slower pace   if nairu  non acceler inflat rate of unemploy  mean anyth  it suggest that the current unemploy rate has to impli some level of market tight that  at the end of the day  either has      to stabil the rate of increas in compens or   in my view veri much more like   induc it  to rise   this suggest to me that the  book forecast of profit margin flatten out and start down seem the most credibl scenario in term of how market forc are like to run  but if that is inde the case  then this is a paus   this is not someth that suggest econom activ is go down  i think we   re be help by recent develop in the oil market   as best i can judg  that is the major factor for the paus here  as it was last year   and i gather that most of the peopl around this tabl also believ that is the case   we had a veri unusu situat go into what is normal the second quarter slowdown in oil consumpt in the northern hemispher and  therefor  in world oil consumpt   the saudi increas product  which creat a signific but temporari glut larg in the lower graviti  more sulfur crude oil that come out of saudi arabia   the effect essenti was to throw a lot of crude oil on the market for which there was no immedi demand or need   the saudi kept say     we   re produc this oil  but we don   t have ani custom      there were custom for the light sweet crude   that   s where the real demand was  in ani event  this oil came on the market and press the spot price down below the forward price   and becaus a futur market essenti spread the suppli demand pattern not onli for the spot market but throughout the whole spectrum of forward market  we end up go from      backward    in the forward market to effect a    contango      in other word  the forward price were at higher level than the spot price  which meant that for the first  e in a veri long  e you could accumul oil inventori profit   you could buy crude at spot  sell it for deliveri six week later at the futur market price then exist  and guarante a spread and a profit        judg from the pattern  a lot of that has been go on becaus crude inventori are rise  this suggest that it is profit for peopl to accumul oil inventori  which was veri obvious not the case earlier   but as inventori rise  the spot price fall relat to the futur price  make it even more profit to hold more inventori   this bring the price down even further  and that process usual  sn   t come to an end unless there is a signific pullback in product or an acceler of demand   or obvious some form of geopolit problem that creat veri grave concern in the marketplac  if this pattern continu   and so far it appear to be work   gasolin price will be come off reason soon   work that has been done by the staff here suggest that gasolin price are essenti a function of the weight averag crude  which is    percent light sweet crude and     percent the heavier  more sulfur crude    the pattern suggest that we are close to where the margin ought to be  and  therefor  declin crude price get reflect fair quick in gasolin price   we   re go to learn quick enough whether or not that is inde undercut grave concern about the outlook   we   ll know whether or not oil   or the energi issu more general   is inde a fundament problem that has creat difficulti over the last six week  i doubt that monetari polici is all that big an issu  becaus as far as the market are concern monetari polici hasn   t chang in ani measur way for month   to be sure  we have been tighten  but the market have been tighten for us   as far as the two year note is concern  the market has tighten well in advanc of anyth that we   ve been do     so  i think it   s hard to make the argument that it   s monetari polici here   where this leav us is that essenti we   re go to have  e to watch what the implic of declin gasolin price are go to be for the outlook   if this is inde a soft patch  then continu with    basi point  as in altern b  and keep the word as close as we can to the previous statement  will      turn out in retrospect to have been exact the right polici   if  howev  we choos to make some  adjust  i think we   ll have some backtrack to do in the languag  if we begin to soften the languag now and this economi start to pick up again  we   ll have to tighten our languag  wherea if we keep what we have in altern b and the economi soften  the market will soften for us   we will have the abil to chang the languag  which we may well choos to do eight week from now  and we will have had one move from where we have been to where we will be in june  rather than confront the possibl of one move and then anoth move  and as far as maintain a stabl monetari polici is concern  usual the fewer move we make to correct earlier move  the better   as a consequ  i think the evid at this point suggest that we should go with altern b   move the fund rate up    basi point and use the languag stipul in     s present on page     presid pool
mr  chairman  i have an altern d  which may not be appropri for today  but it might be help in some futur meet  so let me pass this languag around   while that   s go around  i   d like to say that i agre with jack guynn that we have a real problem in term of the coordin of the statement and the minut   when the minut come out in three week  they   re go to have to reflect the fact that there is widespread uncertainti around the tabl  and somehow i think that ought to be in the statement  becaus that is realli part of the outcom of this meet
that will appear in the minut
oh  it will appear in the minut   but i   m say that i think it ought to appear in the statement  becaus  otherwis  the statement would not truli reflect what happen at the meet   anyway  i want to make that point   that the minut come out in three week      could give a differ impress from the statement   in my view  coordin the two is veri  import   and i think that   s the point jack guynn was rais a few minut ago  some element of my altern d are in the altern c languag in the staff handout   as you know from the memo i distribut  i think the    measur pace    languag is becom less and less use   and i believ that accur communic is both terribl import and terribl difficult   i would like to see us come out   if not today  then at some point   with languag make it veri clear that  depend on the incom inform  we would be open to either a    basi point increas  if the inflat environ seem compel  or a paus   i   m concern that the market expect we are creat of a move of    basi point at our next meet is go to get in the way of either of those outcom   that   s essenti my pitch here  and i have tri to craft in altern d a statement that emphas our inflat concern but at the same  e leav open the possibl of a paus   that was my strategi in the way i formul this  but i think there is a problem   if we have a statement this afternoon that the market subsequ view as not realli consist with the thrust of the minut that come out in three week  i think that creat a problem for us and for the market
rememb  the statement is actual determin after the event that are describ in the minut   so that issu alway exist   it exist the last  e  it will exist in the futur   the point i   ve tri to make to a number of member of the press is that they should alway rememb that what is in the minut  even though they are releas later  reflect what occur befor we vote on the statement   so  whatev the committe vote is the committe   s view at that point   and to stipul that it is other than that impli that peopl are say one thing in the meet and vote differ at the end   i guess that could happen  but not veri often
what i   m say is that for our present meet i think the statement need to take account of the fact that we current have a greater degre of uncertainti about the outlook for both inflat and output   that   s my concern
i understand what you   re say  bill   i must admit that i don   t think what you   re suggest is possibl   i think that is the dilemma that we are confront with   we have the advantag of have brought forward the releas of the minut   the issu that i rais at the veri begin of my remark   name  that the market should know where our prefer are and how we will respond to individu data   i think mitig the problem that concern you   i  frank  don   t think you can achiev what you   re suggest   that   s my opinion   i don   t know what the rest of the committe think
i   ve said my piec
well  i   m fine with where you   re go on this   i do agre that we ought to talk about this at a futur meet   i   m more in favor of shorten the statement and just reli on the minut   other have differ view   but with where we are today  with inertia  i think i   m fine with your propos
mr  chairman  i think we have a conundrum   anoth one   with a capit c on this languag issu   we can   t seem to get unstuck from it   i   ve probabl alreadi said enough  i agre with what bill pool said  but i   m not sure i understood your respons   i think it   s absolut critic that the minut that are go to come out in three week are faith to the tone of the discuss and reflect the rang of uncertainti i heard around the tabl   and i heard an aw lot of uncertainti today  from peopl who were on the side of think that we need to paus to those who      felt that we need to go fa  in rais the fund rate   i also am grow uncomfort with a  statement releas after the meet that  sn   t seem to describ that rang of uncertainti and the latitud that we need as a committe   i wish i were smart enough to offer an altern   i appreci your concern about our post meet statement caus serious  unintend consequ  but i   m not sure the statement we have on the tabl realli   that   obvious  i   ll support it and the    basi point  but i don   t think we   ve got this lick yet   we have a lot more work to do to tri to get it sort out   thank you  mr  chairman
we have a lot of  e to do that   it   s call    eight week      laughter   presid
i know i   m in the minor here   not of the last sever speaker  but overal in the minor   but i   m start to feel like alic in wonderland with this statement   you know  jam tomorrow  jam ye day  but never jam today   it   s never the  e to chang the statement   and frank  i do feel that we have a uniqu opportun here  with a situat in which the risk are more two side   i think that would enabl us to stop give an implicit pledg about polici go forward  now  i   m in agreement on the    basi point   and though i   m not a vote member  if i were  i would take your guidanc on the languag   but i realli feel that what you   ve said is that we have to wait until we   re will to stop rais the fund rate befor we chang this languag   and i   m afraid of what will get embed in the market with that sort of guarante out there
cathi  that   s not my view   i   ve said we have altern  we can chang the languag befor we stop rais rate   we don   t have the choic to decid at one point to stop rais rate and with the statement hold open the likelihood that we are go to rais      rate at the next meet   that is not the same thing as say we can   t chang the languag   inde  we have chang it
well  that   s what i interpret you as say  and obvious i was wrong
i apolog  that was not my intent
i apolog as well   in ani event  i   ve probabl said enough befor on what i   m concern about   i do think we need to get out of promis to do someth about which there is a greater degre of uncertainti at this meet  and presum at subsequ meet  than we felt two or three meet ago   i don   t think that languag is serv us well anymor  but one more meet is not go to kill anyth  i do think the process issu need further discuss   i communic with    probabl not adequ  over the weekend   i didn   t bring a copi of my suggest languag with me   it was differ in some way from what bill had   i was more or less a    four from column b    and    two from column c    person  choos as if order from a chines menu here   grant  i take the point that this is not the place to get into a discuss of move this sentenc here and that sentenc there and tri to get    peopl to agre on it   given the complex of the statement  i just don   t know what process we should use   i   m not sure  even if we spent an entir two day meet  that we   d come up with a statement that is adequ  given all the move part we now have in it   as i said earlier  go back to someth that   s shorter   someth that say what we did and whi we did it and let the minut convey the rang of view   is where i think we ought to be head   but  again  that just may not be in the card any  soon
thank you  mr  chairman   i can support your propos as you laid it out   if my earlier comment had ani direct  it was that i think there is some benefit to tri to      shorten up a littl what is now convey in sentenc   and   and to say a bit less   but we   ve ad  word rather than subtract some   i understand the stabil issu and i agre with it  but stabil  sn   t necessarili mean use exact the same word about area that are in fact of concern to us   have said that  where we are here on the propos languag is not signific far from where i would be in the best of all world   so  i have no problem support it
again  mr  chairman  i   m new  and i want to be appropri humbl and respect   i listen veri care to what you were say   the way i interpret the first part of what you said is that we don   t want to signal the market that we know someth the market don   t anticip or don   t know   have been a market oper and be sensit on that front  i agre with that   and i don   t think there   s an argument for a paus  so i would argu for a    basi point increas in the fund rate  i   m a littl worri about later in the statement signal to market particip what they may interpret as someth that we know that they do not know   so i would again suggest that we might consid a chang in the    measur pace    languag against that background   the idea of maintain a measur pace impli we will continu along this path  and if we deviat from that path  that might come as an unpleas surpris to the marketplac  as to the procedur  i   m too new to have ani opinion on that   like you  cathi  i too have sort of a rubik   s cube of move part to place   i would suggest  against the background of what   said  the possibl of just elimin section   entir in altern a   that would give us a shorter statement and even reflect a concern about some asymmetri that we   re detect  and i think that might do the job
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve alreadi said i support    basi point   i also support your broader perspect that we should tri to keep the languag pretti much unchang   given what has alreadi been said  let me just make three or four comment  first  on the word    measur      i alreadi talk about that  and i agre with your sort of risk manag approach   second  on the role of the statement  i think the statement is meant to be  as best as it can be  an explan of what we did and whi we did it   i think cathi said that   but it  sn   t have to reflect all the uncertainti note by the    peopl as we went around the tabl   i think it is not inconsist to have minut that suggest a lot of back and forth and uncertainti and then to have a statement that reflect where we all coalesc   with differ degre of comfort  but we coalesc   i   m not as anxious as other seem to be about the fact that the statement  sn   t reflect the give and take and the back and forth  becaus that   s not necessari to explain what we did and whi we did it   with respect to drop the sentenc on the balanc of risk  though   unfortun i   m speak befor   and i would love to hear her view   i would be a littl cautious at this stage  it   s not becaus i   m in love with it  actual  i think it has outliv it use in this particular mode   there may be better way to convey our sens of the balanc of risk  but i don   t think we have a better way right now   and given the uncertainti in the current situat  i think the fewer chang we make in the statement  the better  for the reason you point out  and  final  you made some point about where we might go with polici   i know it   s imposs to avoid that inevit overshoot   do one or two move too mani and regret it   but i think this realli is the  e when we have to tri veri hard to avoid overshoot  becaus if the outlook is anywher close to the forecast in the  book  all we   re tri to do is to get rate back to neutral   we   re not tri to be terribl restrict   so what i was suggest earlier was that       overshoot by    basi point   while it   s not the end of the world and we can come back from  it   would be unfortun   i think we have to start be veri sensit about each one of these move and be prepar to take a paus and restart  if we have to  though we obvious can   t signal that  on process  i won   t take up too much  e   jack suggest longer meet   i had told   ye day   and this may surpris you   that while these meet work extrem well under leadership that has    year of experi  we may now be in a posit where we need to spend a littl more  e togeth   i   m not propos that formal  that   s for sure   certain  i   ve been told that the bank of england meet for two day with seven  eight  or nine peopl   or whatev the number   is a pretti pain process   so with    peopl  it   s unlik to be less pain    laughter  but i think your point is well taken that these meet have becom much more interest and interact   and tri to do all we need to do in a short period of  e might not be the right way to go   i wouldn   t propos that as long as you are the chair  but i suspect we may at some point want to spend more  e togeth as we go forward   i guess that   s my rang of wisdom on the veri wise comment of my colleagu today
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend on both count   the    basi point and altern b  i know we alway say that we will know a lot more at the next meet  but this  e we realli will    laughter   we   re go to have two set of price data and two set of employ data  so i think we will have a much better sens as to whether this is a soft patch or not and how serious the inflat risk are at that point        i think the statement actual   a good job of point out the slow in the solid pace of spend growth on the one hand and that inflat pressur also have pick up   so  i think that balanc is veri good  go forward  i would just say that i  too  would like to get out of the forward look statement if we possibl can   i   d like a shorter statement in the near futur   i   d like to drop the balanc of risk statement  which i don   t think add anyth now   i agre that it has outliv it use  as governor   said   i just don   t think now is the  e to do it  i do think the chanc are that this statement realli will requir major chang at our june meet   i don   t know what those are go to be at this point  it will depend on the data  of cours  but i do think it will requir major chang  and that   s probabl the  e to look at all of this  now  i am not go to respond to governor olson   s veri unfair comment about the chicago bull except to say that we will see how the washington wizard do when they lose their home court advantag in the next game and have to face the chicago bull in the friend confin of the unit center    laughter
let me point out that it isn   t how they do but how they communic what they do    laughter
is that the end of your    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i support  of cours  your propos to rais the feder fund rate    basi point  and i think the strategi that you suggest with respect to the languag in altern b also has merit for today   it seem to me advantag at this point to make      minim chang in the statement  as altern b     i think market expect are essenti  entir sensibl  and it   not make sens today to do a great deal to perturb those expect  i think the polici path we   re on  as don put it  like has a posit slope   i   m comfort with the term    measur pace    becaus i think it continu to indic that whether we call polici accommod or somewhat accommod  the like direct of the feder fund rate is up  and i think we ought to be communic that   i believ that we retain consider flexibl to paus or to be more aggress   we see that  as you point out  mr  chairman  in the futur path as the market respond to the news  so  i think we do have flexibl   but i agre with governor   that we need an exit strategi from this exit strategi  and my propos is to get rid of the balanc of risk statement  mayb today is not the right day to do it  but as part of our ul  exit strategi  which we may well need at the next meet  i would love to see that go   i feel that we do need to communic someth about the futur  but in my view craft a simpl english sentenc or two to describ the consensus on the committe is the way to do it   to me the balanc of risk statement was an attempt to give hint about the futur path of polici without say anyth about the fund rate direct but instead about the determin of polici   and i just don   t think that   s possibl  i read presid pool   s memo and i understand the desir of have standard languag  but we have a committe that hasn   t obtain a consensus on the determin of polici  we don   t have a common definit of maximum employ or price stabil   we don   t have a common view on the import of forecast or an agreement on relat valu of gap versus growth rate in make those forecast   without that kind of consensus  we just can   t come up with a formula assess about the balanc of risk   it might work for a coupl of meet  but then we   re go to get ourselv in a situat where it will fail  and that   s where i feel we are today        so  go forward  it may be that the  e to chang this languag is when we do paus and no longer feel certain what the direct of polici is   mayb at that  e a simpl statement that say someth like this will be the sensibl way to go      under current condit  polici seem well posit to achiev our dual goal and we will respond  as need  to fulfil our oblig to fo  price stabil and sustain econom growth
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i will support the   point increas in the fund rate and the languag of altern b   as i read through altern b  i think it communic what we want to communic   it say that the pace of spend growth has slow and it repeat our concern about inflat   i will have to say that as i get down to paragraph   and    i am also of the opinion that they are start to get a littl shopworn and that we do need to think through how we want to communic our assess of risk  have said that  i think my view are in a signific way impact by my recollect of the summer of      where  in the cours of three meet  we had three differ vehicl of communic  or variat of communic  and by the third one we had confus the market  and this was after what i thought was the most specif clear articul of our polici   that remind me again that we ought to be veri deliber in term of how we chang our communic  i think we   ve done the market a great favor by acceler the releas of the minut   that earlier releas of the minut now allow us to go back and look again at the type of statement we releas immedi after the meet   and i would suggest that we look at this issu in that context  it may allow us to alter the method by which we communic on the day of the meet
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your propos  both the   point increas in the fund rate and the altern b languag   i think a measur pace of increas in the fund rate is still our best guess of what we   ll have to do   i heard one or two peopl around the tabl say that we might be closer to a paus than we thought  owe to the recent data  and one or two peopl around the tabl say that we might have to acceler the pace becaus they   re put more emphasi on the incom inflat data   but i think the broad center of the committe is still with the measur pace of increas and  therefor  the broad center of the committe believ   i think   that we ought to tell the market that we still think rate are too low and will have to rise   and if we tell them that without tell them someth about remov accommod at a measur  pace  i think we   ll be convey more uncertainti about our intent than would be help   in my view  it would not be help to remov that languag at this point  i agre that the balanc of risk statement right now is broken and is either meaningless or  if it   s meaning  it   s rather distort   but i think it   s go to be veri  veri hard to remov it without send a signal that we think we might be behind the curv in one sens or anoth  and i don   t think we are  and i don   t think we want to send that signal   so  my guess is that line   and   here are go to have to be rework  but onli at the point when we think we   re near the paus point  and i don   t think that   s go to be june  presid     i   d be veri surpris if it were  i think it   s go to be veri hard to rework those sentenc befor we think we   re close to be finish with the tighten process   thank you  mr  chairman
i support    basi point and altern b   i agre that we should not soften the statement at this meet   and in fact  when i read altern b  i interpret it as tighten somewhat by remov the statement about energi price not have fed notabl through      to core consum price    if anyth  i was lean toward a tighter statement  but i think   altern b would serv us well right now  i want to again endors presid     s notion that we should look for an occas to remov the balanc of risk assess from the statement at the earliest opportun   we can be clear about what we are do  i think it is hinder communic now   i also agre with her with regard to presid pool   s memo   unavoid  we are communic to the market   and to expect to do so by devis formula languag that is go to last beyond a coupl of meet is too op ist on that score  i think  i also want to note that on the idea of an exit strategi i agre with you that it   s pretti hard to envis a statement to accompani no rate chang that would also induc market to believ that we   re sure to increas rate at the next meet   i don   t care that much about the shape of the yield curv between now and six month out  and i would prefer rais rate at the first meet and not at the second   so  i think put a fine point on it  sn   t make sens  now  have said that  when we do get to a point where we paus  i think it   s go to be import not to drain the sensit out of the yield curv   we do not want to convinc market that we think we   re go to be done for sever quarter or for a coupl of year   we want to maintain in market some sensit to incom data   to believ that we might move   point either way on the fund rate   and becaus of that i   ve tri to avoid use the term    neutral    to character the rate at which we will stop move  but there are other approach to that i suppos  so  again  i can support what   s on the tabl
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support your recommend for a    basi point increas in the fed fund rate target  and i will also take your guidanc on the languag       as i said earlier  though  i had a prefer for express more uncertainti about not onli the  outlook on inflat but also the  e and magnitud of our futur move   but given what you said earlier  i will support your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i support your recommend to move the fund rate up    basi point and to use the languag of altern b   in my remark  i made some nois about combin some element of altern a  i   m not go to press that  base on the discuss  i think i   ve lost that debat   and the hour is get late  so i   m fine with b  on the minut  i think i   m with roger in that i don   t realli see the problem   we issu a fair ters statement   subsequ  the minut come out and they give a lot of color   the minut indic that some peopl felt this and some peopl felt that   that is all said  it   s faith transcrib   i think it just fill in some of the blank   so  i don   t realli see what the problem is   i actual do think it   s a great assist to us that the minut are come out with a three week lag   i think that   s go to be one of the better thing we   ve ever done  though i must say a lot of us had reserv about it at the  e  on the process issu  one thing we   ve learn is that we can   t make major rhetor chang at the meet   these statement have to be read probabl eight  e to figur out all the nook and cranni in them   if we get a statement circul at the meet  it is just too late to assess all the nuanc   we   re tire  and we   re not think about the word from all perspect   so  i don   t think that is a good idea  let me suggest one thing that we might consid   i actual think the format that we have develop   where we get altern a  b  and c and have a chanc to studi them   work pretti      well   but i think the domain of the option has gotten rather narrow   look at the differ  between a and b   in line    there   s a    further    in altern a and in line    there   s a    somewhat     in line    altern b has a    somewhat    and in line    there   s a    while      in line   the word    action    is gone in altern a    laughter   this is pretti small potato  i think  compar to what some peopl are talk about   so  one thing that we might consid is to have a littl extra materi in the bluebook everi now and then   mayb at the januari and june meet or mayb at this critic  e when we   re go to chang our strategi   that give a broader rang of option   the staff could provid a draft statement without this bank of sentenc with minor variat   just look at it in a littl bigger way   that way we   d still get a chanc to studi it and we wouldn   t be get a statement late in the meet  the last thing i want to say is that i total agre with   that line   ought to go   i   ve been  on two committe that have tri to fix that up  and we couldn   t do it   at one point i sent some memo around and tri to do it on my own   that didn   t work either   i don   t think we can fix it  and i think that   s when we start on sentenc   de novo   we had a specif problem  and we work out languag to deal with it   i   m say    we     but in fact you did that   and i think sentenc    has work much better than     so  at some point sentenc   ought to go   let   s just tri to come up with some ters languag that give the full dimens in     that would be my suggest  thank you
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  think the   point increas in the fund rate target is appropri  and the languag in altern b is fine with me today   i don   t think it   s essenti to make ani major chang in the languag at the moment  and it   s probabl not a good idea        i do agre with presid   and other that the balanc of risk statement should probabl be jettison at the earliest opportun   but i would also say that i think there is valu in provid some forward look guidanc to the market   more general  among other thing  it help to assur a certain consist in polici  and i think that is of valu as well
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the recommend to rais rate    basi point  and i   ll support altern b   as the governor know  i   ve been frustrat with the whole    assess of risk    piec of this  but ye day  after think about it  i realiz that it isn   t so simpl to craft the altern   one of the thing that i   m struck by is that sentenc   and   are realli the meat of the releas each  e   they tell how we   re look at the real economi and at  inflat  which are our two major mandat   but if we didn   t have someth tie them togeth   to convey some conclus about the risk   that would leav the market hang   to me  that   s what would happen if we got rid of line   and   entir   so  i think we do need someth to anchor that   at first i was lean toward altern c  line    think that would do it   then the more i read it  i thought  these refer to fo  the attain of sustain econom growth and price stabil are like motherhood and appl pie   obvious  this is what the fed is suppos to do   so  is it realli say anyth   we could have that sentenc in there no matter what   if the rate of inflat were    percent or if unemploy were down to     percent  so the question is  what do we need there    i think we need someth beyond just the rational for our decis today   right now  i think sentenc   is import becaus it say that while we get nois in the data  under all of this we are still accommod   and that set up the notion of a longer run horizon beyond the next meet        so  as we look to replac this  it   s almost as if the longer run horizon is the import point  mayb  as presid   said  this get back to the way we set our goal and target overal   but we need a longer run anchor  and then we need a short run signal to the market   so i don   t think we can just elimin the risk assess   we have to say someth  especi at  e such as this where we have risk on both side
i think it make sens for us to rais the fund rate     basi point  and i support altern b   fortun  we don   t need to decid today whether this statement is go to make sens in it current structur in june or in august or octob   we can make the decis at those  e   the onli thing we need to decid today is whether we want to alter signific the expect now price in the market for the futur path of the fed fund rate  and i agre with what a number of you said   that there   s not a compel case for do so  the second thing one can say we need to decid is whether we want to introduc more uncertainti or greater dispers around the set of expect that now exist   again  i don   t think there   s a compel case for us to tri to do that as a conscious act of signal today   i think altern b is actual a pretti good signal for today  and i don   t actual know what is go to make sens in june or for the structur of the statement go forward
okay   i think we have a consensus on    basi point and the  word in altern b   would you read the appropri languag
i   ll be read from page    of the bluebook the languag for altern b     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas      the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent         the committe perceiv that  with  appropri monetari polici action  the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil should be kept rough equal   with under inflat expect to be contain  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur   nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil
