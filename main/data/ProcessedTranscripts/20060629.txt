good afternoon  everybodi   i   d like to start off by   recogn tom simpson   this is tom   s last fomc meet   after twenti year  he is retir in august    applaus   thank you   the first item on the agenda is action to approv the foia plan and deleg       is here on this   are there ani question on the memo that was circul   if not  i need a motion    sever   i move
without object   thank you   the next item is foreign currenc and domest open market oper   mr  kos  thank you  mr  chairman   for the last sever meet i have
begun my comment by say that this long period of low volatil and tight spread continu   today i have to modifi that   dure this intermeet period  some market were veri volatil   but other were either calm or character by moder level of volatil   spread remain tight and default rate low   in the first exhibit  the top panel graph the msci equiti index sinc may        just befor the u s  tighten cycl began   equiti market in all region appreci sharpli  with emerg market do best   the u s  index  the black line at bottom  underperform   not surpris  the high beta market that appreci the most also fell the most   i   ll have more to say about some of the specif market later   the middl panel graph the realiz volatil sinc januari   for the unit state  europ  japan  and emerg market sub index   volatil rose sharpli  especi outsid the unit state right after the may fomc meet   the reason for the sudden shift in sen ent is not clear   both institut and retail investor had report alloc signific fund to emerg market equiti in the past six month and so may not have had much of a cushion to absorb may   s loss   these investor were more like to sell when the tide turn   similar  hedg fund that mark to market and that report result to investor month also have less capac to sit on sink posit   whether leverag or not  investor have been more worri   the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     about so call crowd trade  which is code for widespread particip in relat illiquid market where the exit door is pretti small   emerg market equiti and commod were probabl the best exampl of this phenomenon   a variant explan center not so much on technic factor and posit but rather on the lag effect of the withdraw of so call excess liquid as central bank worldwid tighten monetari polici   i   ll come back to that as well   as the top two graph show  the u s  equiti market has been less interest than some of it global counterpart  mani of which have fallen by doubl digit over the past six week   the s p     in contrast has fallen about   percent sinc may     the busi tabl at the bottom of the page list those period in which the s p     has fallen    percent or more sinc        there have been twenti nine such period  or rough onc everi two or three year   view histor  the recent price move are not unusu   to drill down a bit into emerg market equiti  pleas turn to page     the top panel graph the perform of equiti market in brazil  india  mexico  russia  south africa  korea  and turkey   the blue bar graph perform for the period from januari          to may      the red bar graph perform from may    through ye day   the middl panel graph  for the same countri  perform of their currenc for the same period   the chart seem to support this notion of strong appetit for riskier asset earlier this year and then a sudden shift to reduc posit in riskier market   of cours  when volatil begin to rise  intermediari such as invest bank show an increas in valu at risk that they wish to reduc   the process of reduc that risk onli reinforc the trend in the short run  and asset that were thought to be uncorrel sudden start to move in unison   the bottom panel graph metal price from januari   like emerg market equiti  metal price rose on perceiv strong fundament   the momentum player jump on board and gave price a boost   price peak around mid may  and as the risk reduct phase kick in  price came down  though they are still up for the year   howev  the risk reduct stori goe onli so far   it is evid in specif and fair narrow

at veri low level despit the excit elsewher   in fact  as shown in the top left panel  although the vix spike to about    percent in mid may  it quick came off and is below it long term averag   similar  although credit spread are mild wider  as shown in the bottom three panel  absolut level remain generous and far below the level observ last spring  when general motor    announc caus a sudden widen of spread   the bullish interpret of the recent bout of volatil is that it has been limit to narrow set of asset class and could be compar with last spring   s event  which did not have spillov effect outsid the area of credit deriv and convert arbitrag   this view suggest that those asset that appreci    too far too fast    need to revert to some notion of fair valu and that there is no reason for broader effect   the bearish case argu that too mani investor have more risk on their book than they would like and will seek opportun to sell into ani ralli  accord to this view  the movement in iceland and new zealand in march were the precursor to may   s volatil in a broader set of market  which may be a precursor to subsequ price declin in more develop market   the top panel

top of each other  the market are probe to locat the point at which the committe will paus from the meet by meet pattern of tighten   in contrast  the ecb is view as have further to go  as seen by the wider spread between cash and forward rate   inde  in the past few day ecb offici note that the pace of tighten could be acceler   the middl panel graph the evolut of current account balanc at the bank of japan in blue and the overnight call rate in     cab came down from about  ¥   trillion to the low teen over a two month span   howev  in recent week the call rate has had sudden spike toward the boj   s lombard style lend facil  which is set at    basi point   in respons  the boj ad reserv   from a low of about  ¥   trillion in earli june  cab have risen to about  ¥   trillion  compar with requir reserv of about  ¥  trillion to  ¥  trillion  and yet the call rate remain stubborn firm   the bottom panel graph the japanes govern bond yield curv from three month out to ten year as of ye day and a year earlier   as shown by the   line  a year ago the money market curv was essenti at zero  and all rate out to two year were extrem low   arguabl the weight of all those reserv in the system work to push down more of the yield curv toward zero   now  as those reserv are be withdrawn  money market rate are no longer be held down   so while the target call rate for the boj remain near zero  in realiti condit have tighten up   outsid the g   the stori is similar   worri about inflat are lead to modest increas in rate   among the countri whose central bank tighten polici dure the intermeet period were canada  switzerland  sweden  turkey  south africa  korea  thailand  and india   some  like turkey  had fundament and polici challeng they were address   the linkag between monetari polici and asset market is difficult to defin and measur   but those investor that take a more bearish perspect cite the tighten of polici global and the withdraw of liquid as risk factor go forward   on page    the top panel graph the two  and ten year treasuri yield along with the target fed fund rate  in      yield had been hover near the current fund target but move toward

the breakeven rate came off somewhat after the chairman   s comment to the intern monetari confer and subsequ comment by committe member   the middl right panel graph those same two rate over a longer  e frame   despit the attent that market have given the rise in breakeven earlier this year  broad speak breakeven are veri close to level observ at the begin of the tighten cycl two year ago   the bottom panel graph the dollar   s exchang rate against the euro and yen  the dollar has appreci against both   although the broad fundament have not chang  the dollar may have benefit from safe haven effect and an unwind of short dollar posit as hedg fund and other reduc risk in recent week   final  i want to say a few word about our recent experi with check float  especi given process chang relat to check     check clear for the   st centuri act    for the desk  float tend to be a focus on tuesday larg becaus these are peak process day   pronounc but episod spike in float began to appear last octob   the top panel on page   graph the actual float  the gray bar  and our forecast for float  the red dot    as we have been told  the major contribut factor to these behavior chang in float is a combin of hardwar and softwar problem that have appear in the process of check    file   the challeng for the desk is to forecast float and adjust reserv provis appropri   at  e in recent month we have been surpris by high level of float that we did not forecast  at other  e we had the opposit surpris   we were told to expect float that did not materi   for refer  the middl panel graph the same set of month in the year earlier period show lower level of float  lower volatil of float  and import for us  less variat between the forecast and the actual   but the import question is whether we can trace float to higher level of fund volatil given the numer other factor that can affect the suppli of reserv   the bottom panel tri to inform  if not fulli answer  that question   the dot repres the differ between the forecast and the actual float level   the y axi graph the standard deviat of the fund rate on that date   we have arbitrarili drawn a line at    basi point to demarc a high volatil day   the blue dot repres observ in the year earlier period   they tend to show small forecast error  and those date were not associ with high level of volatil   the red dot cover the more recent period  and they show six observ with veri larg forecast error  of which four were associ with high level of fed fund volatil   thus  one shouldn   t exagger the effect of check    on desk oper  but at the same  e the effect should not minim either   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in the period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
thank you   a lot of the discuss of the stock market volatil point to uncertainti about monetari polici   but the bond market suggest veri littl uncertainti about monetari polici   can you talk about that paradox
yes  i think one of the interest point about this period is that veri question   some of the high risk asset that had been bid up are where we have the most pronounc price move  and that   perhap suggest that posit is a bigger part of the stori becaus bond market were relat tame not just in the unit state but also in other  oversea bond market   so someth of a risk adjust seem to have happen   i think the interest question is whi  but it   s veri  veri hard to discern that   i  at least  tend to minim the effect that uncertainti about monetari polici itself has had in caus the volatil in emerg market equiti   certain if one take the opposit view  then one has some explain to do in term of the previous coupl of year when a tighten cycl was occur  at differ  e there was uncertainti about the pace and extent of the tighten  and yet those market continu to ralli despit that uncertainti
as for the turn in metal  can you talk about the relat import of risk factor  higher interest rate  and inflat expect
it   s reason that all of those factor would have had some influenc   i suppos anoth factor would be the extent to which some market particip may have seen not onli posit but also futur weak from the global tighten that is occur  especi in the industri countri but also in china   that such tighten will at some point affect the demand for commod and for resourc   some of those posit and adjust may have been fundament base   if one had to explain the scale of the price move  that would probabl be a secondari factor
other question for dino   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to continu with the first question that you pose to dino   what you said in your present  dino  is veri close to what peopl have been tell me about how they are see the market   some peopl at the top of hedg fund and mutual fund have said that market particip saw sign of overreach everywher in the winter and earli spring   then there was a period   and perhap your chart are point to earli may   when a good deal of retrench was go on   the hedg fund and mutual fund peopl were not point to uncertainti about u s  monetari polici so much as uncertainti about monetari polici worldwid   but the real reason was a chang appreci of what the worldwid economi was do  the need for tighten becaus of the effect of rise growth and potenti inflationari effect   some of them continu to be concern that enough wring out hasn   t yet happen  that more risk take is still out there   you were talk about the bear and the bull  and i   m just wonder where you are   where do you think the balanc of risk is here
from a market perspect  that is the most interest question   i recal an exchang that presid   and i had a coupl of meet ago  when we were talk about the zloti and the iceland krona and whether that was sort of a precursor  perhap the begin of a longer phase of a downscal of risk   there might be someth to be said for that   we were in a lengthi period when investor were reach for yield  and i   m not sure that two month is go to cleans the system
it   s imposs to see these thing beforehand  but everyon is nervous about the idea of crowd trade   what havoc they could caus   clear  iceland saw a bit of it  it   s probabl too much to ask to gain a sens of what could possibl be a problem here  other than that we need to be conscious that problem could be out there
i don   t want to specul   i don   t think my guess would be ani better than anybodi els   s   anoth view is that the market that had been price furthest from fair valu are the one that are adjust  and a case can be made that  onc they equilibr  we shouldn   t have spillov effect   now it   s hard to know which way the scale will tip  but good case can be made on both side
ani other question for dino   if not  we need a vote to ratifi open market transact   motion
without object   thank you   we   ll turn now to the econom situat  thank you  mr  chairman   mani of the spend indic
that we   ve receiv over the past few week have been come in to the weak side of our expect   as you can see by compar the red and blue stripe bar in the top left panel of exhibit    in the  book we respond to the weaker number by revis down our project for second quarter growth of real gdp to a   percent annual rate  about    percentag point less than in the may  book   we interpret some of the unexpect soft as reflect weaker under demand  and we let that part feed through beyond the current quarter as well   but as i   ll discuss short  the soft of the spend data wasn   t the onli factor lead us to temper our forecast for the out quarter   a key compon of the downward revis to the current quarter has been a slower than anticip pace of consum spend   the panel to the right   base larg on the avail data for retail sale  motor vehicl  and the cpi  we es  that real pce in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of onli     percent   the slow reflect a step down in purchas of light motor vehicl as well as essenti flat real outlay for good other than motor vehicl in the first two month of the quarter   the other big surpris in the recent data is the sharper than expect drop off in hous activ  as illustr in the middl left panel   despit the may uptick in   the materi use by messr        and kamin are append to this transcript  appendix     hous start  the level of both start and permit are well below where we thought they would be at the  e of the last  book    in contrast to the household sector  the busi sector indic general have been favor   for exampl  order and shipment for nondefens capit good  plot to the right  continu to point to strengthen demand   in addit  busi spend for new structur  not shown  appear to have post anoth sizabl gain this quarter   the scant data avail for june do not suggest that the slowdown in spend earlier in the quarter has been cumul   as shown in the bottom left  initi claim for unemploy insur  after retrac the rise that was associ with the effect of the temporari govern shutdown in puerto rico  have remain in a rang consist with further moder employ increas  meanwhil  as shown to the right  the empir state and philadelphia busi survey  which were less favor in april and may  were consider more posit this month    thus  while mani of the indic of activ have late been to the downsid of our expect  the news has not been entir negat   all told  we still see econom growth as be in a transit   to a pace somewhat below that of potenti   this can be seen in exhibit    which present the longer run outlook   we now think that real gdp  as shown by the stripe blue bar in the top left panel  will increas at a    percent rate in the second half of this year and through        as i mention earlier  sever develop besid the incom spend indic influenc our think about the econom outlook   first  revis data from the bea now put the      q  chang in wage and salari disburs  plot by the black line in the top right panel  consider below the figur publish at the  e of the last  book  the red dash line   the reduct in labor incom suggest less consumpt go forward   regard our assumpt for monetari polici  the fund rate is assum to be increas to    percent at this meet and to remain there through the end of        as shown in the middl right panel  the wilshir      stock market index is about   percent below the level we had assum in the may  book   we assum that equiti price will rise at a     percent annual rate go forward   a pace that rough maintain risk adjust pariti with the return on treasuri secur   the latest read on hous price from the ofheo index  illustr in the bottom left panel  was in line with our expect   we continu to expect an appreci deceler in hous price over the project period   final  after sever  book in which we revis up our forecast of crude oil price  this round we revis down our forecast   when we prepar the  book  the spot price of wti was just under     per barrel  about    less than at the  e of the may  book   and with futur price also lower  we reduc the path of crude oil price throughout the project period   exhibit   present some detail of the outlook for busi fix invest   as  illustr in the top left panel  total real outlay for equip and softwar  exclud the volatil transport equip compon  are project to increas     percent over the four quarter of      and to grow near as fast in        you can see from the red portion that the bulk of the support come from spend for high tech equip   much of the recent strength in the high tech sector has reflect a spurt in capit spend for communic equip by telecom servic provid  wherea demand for server and pcs  the top right panel  has falter   howev  our forecast call for real outlay for comput equip to pick up later this year and to be sustain in        industri analyst cite sever upcom technolog develop that should boost demand for new server and pcs   these are summar in the middl left panel   with regard to server  sever manufactur plan to offer new generat of server this autumn that offer signific fa  comput power and  just as import  lower electr consumpt   in addit to ongo demand for larg scale server from financi servic compani  demand for clu  of small scale server   so call server farm   by internet content provid  for exampl  also appear to be robust   with regard to pcs  intel will be introduc a fundament new chip design in the second half of this year that report will increas perform and signific reduc power consumpt  with the new generat of chip on the horizon  price on old chip have been plummet   we project that demand for pcs should step up later this year  spur by the combin of the new generat of chip for high end user and fall price on old chip for middl  and low end user    the tabl to the right present our forecast for real spend on nonresidenti structur   as shown in line    outlay for drill and mine have been grow brisk   reflect the sharp increas in price of oil and natur gas over the past few year  the number of drill rig in oper  the bottom left panel  has been climb steadili  with much of the increas for the natur gas compon   we see the growth of activ slow somewhat next year as the price of natur gas and crude oil begin to flatten   outsid drill and mine  invest in new build has strengthen recent  as vacanc rate  illustr for offic build by the black line in the bottom right panel  have been trend down and rent receiv by build owner  the red line  have been climb   that said  we think the current rate of invest growth is unsustain  given our project of deceler employ and busi sale  and consequ the growth rate of construct spend slow in our forecast    turn now to the household sector  the subject of exhibit    we expect real pce  the red bar in the top left panel  to increas at a rate of about   percent in the second half of this year and to stay close to that pace in        the forecast reflect two import crosscurr   on the one hand  real incom growth  the blue bar  is project to be robust reflect  in part  a wane drag from higher energi price  on the other hand  the wealth to incom ratio  plot by the black line in the top right panel  fall in our forecast as hous price deceler   with slower gain in wealth and rise interest rate  we expect that spend will be restrain relat to incom and  accord  the save rate will rise   the remaind of the exhibit examin the hous market   look through the month volatil  you can see that sale of new home and exist home  the middl left panel  are well off their peak  wherea backlog of unsold home  the panel to the right  have increas signific   in put togeth the forecast  we factor in the recent data on start  sale  and inventori  which led us to mark down the profil of activ throughout the forecast period   all told  as shown in the bottom left panel  we expect that real residenti invest spend will drop    percent this year and fall anoth    percent next year   widespread anecdot report suggest that the drop in demand is be driven part by a withdraw from the market by investor and purchas of second home  data on mortgag origin by investor and those purchas second home  which begin on a month basi in mid      and are avail onli through march  are plot to the right   the first thing to note is that these group are a relat small part of the overal market   moreov  although the data are quit noisi  neither group  at least through march  was leav the hous market in drove  nevertheless  the recent spate of report and a jump in the rate of contract cancel for new home  which homebuild attribut larg to a retreat by investor  pose a downsid risk to the hous outlook   anoth risk to the forecast is the possibl of a pronounc deterior in the financi condit of some vulner household  which could caus them to retrench signific on spend   as shown in exhibit   in the top left panel  the financi oblig ratio for homeown has risen sharpli over the past year or so  it reach a record high in the second half of last year  and we es  that it rose further in the first quarter of this year    as an asid  the rate for renter has actual been fall sinc mid       though that could be chang    some analyst have express concern about the high level of the financi oblig ratio   especi in light of the potenti for further increas in oblig relat to variabl payment mortgag  which repres more than one fifth of all outstand first lien mortgag   nowaday  variabl payment mortgag typic carri a fix interest rate for a few year befor convert to float rate  and most aren   t schedul for a payment chang for some  e   the top right tabl present some evid  as you can see in the last column  the bulk of variabl rate mortgag   both arm and interest onli   that have yet to repric won   t begin to repric until after       moreov  the end of the interest onli term for near all i o mortgag that are await the end of the i o term is well in the futur   line   of the tabl   given these pattern  schedul mortgag payment chang should have onli a limit effect on the aggreg mortgag burden   ad just a few tenth to the homeown    financi oblig ratio this year and next   as a result  we have not seen   and don   t expect   a broad deterior in mortgag credit qualiti   for exampl  as shown in the middl left panel  delinqu rate for prime borrow  who account for    percent of the mortgag market  have been relat flat for some  e   as illustr by the black line    that said  there are some indic of stress among subprim borrow   this group presum is at greater potenti risk for financi stress general   note the higher level of their delinqu rate  the red line  compar with the prime market  in particular  we are see a deterior among subprim borrow with variabl rate mortgag   the red line in the panel to the right   this type of loan is far more preval in the subprim market  repres about two third of all subprim mortgag   the fix rate period for subprim variabl rate loan is consider shorter than that for prime loan   typic one or two year versus five to seven year   so more subprim borrow with variabl rate mortgag are like to see their month payment rise over the project period   and the increas for those subprim borrow experienc reset could be strike   we es  increas of someth like    to    percent of their origin payment   more general  household that are like to be more financi vulner appear to have becom decid more pessimist   the bottom left panel plot the michigan consum sen ent index stratifi by incom   consum sen ent for both upper  and lower incom group plung last autumn   current  both group appear more concern than they had been befor mid       but the lower third appear especi nervous   our baselin project for the household sector incorpor these develop   nevertheless  the greater stress evid among the most financi vulner segment of the household sector present a downsid risk to the forecast     will now continu our present
exhibit   turn to the outlook for compens   the first column of the top left panel show that recent read on the product and cost measur of compens have been quit choppi   increas in the employ cost index  shown in the right hand column  have been smoother but have been puzzl in their own right  in that they have been run so low   the two gaug differ methodolog in mani respect  some of which are item in the panel to the right   despit their differ  both measur suggest that compens pressur have remain subdu even as the labor market has tighten   we expect that  over the project period  resourc util   repres in the middl left panel by the differ between the unemploy rate and our es  of the nairu   will be onli a small influenc on compens growth  boost it a bit this year and restrain it slight next year as the economi cool   a larger influenc on the outlook is repres in the right hand panel   as shown by the third pair of bar  real compens has not kept pace with product dure the past sever year   between now and the end of next year  as shown by the rightmost pair of bar  we expect this situat to revers and real compens to increas a littl more rapid than product  as competit for scarcer worker caus past product gain and higher overal price inflat to feed into compens   as shown in the bottom left panel  the result increas in real compens caus the markup of price over unit labor cost to declin slight from it current histor high level and  as shown in the bottom right panel  caus both the eci and compens per hour to acceler somewhat in nomin term from their recent subdu rate of growth   nonetheless  with the price markup remain well abov it histor averag  we think such increas in labor cost would not prompt new upward pressur on price   exhibit   turn to the outlook for price inflat   as shown in the middl column of the tabl in the top left  core pce price increas more quick in march  april  and may than in the preced two month  boost our forecast for the increas in core price in the second quarter as a whole to     percent at an annual rate   as shown to the right  core inflat and it market base compon have track each other quit close of late on a four quarter basi and are project to do so over the forecast period  suggest no unusu mischief on the part of nonmarket price   we continu to expect core pce inflat to eas back next year   the major reason for this moder is shown in the middl left panel  after bulg again this quarter  energi price are expect to be rough flat over the remaind of the project period   on our assumpt  which i will discuss in more detail in a few minut  that flatten take about   percentag point off core pce price inflat next year   sever measur of inflat expect are shown in the middl right panel  as you know  consum    expect back off in earli june  accord to the univers of michigan survey  and tip base inflat compens has come down a bit as well in the past few week   nonetheless  as shown in line   of the tabl at the bottom of the page  the two cpi report we have receiv sinc the may meet boost our es  of core pce inflat over the first half of this year     percentag point   and as shown in the third and fourth column  we have essenti carri that bad news forward despit the slight greater amount of slack in the economi and the slight lower profil of energi price from here forward   exhibit   investig whether the staff inflat model have been move off track recent   as you know  we consult a broad rang of model  but to keep the discuss manag  i will report on just two of those specif   as note in the top panel  the first is a backward look model that use lag inflat to proxi for under or expect inflat   the second specif is a part forward look model that use a weight averag of both lag inflat and expect inflat as measur in the survey of profession forecast   the bottom line from this exercis is that  although both model have certain made sizabl quarter forecast error of late  neither has been substanti and consist surpris by the perform of inflat over the past sever year in a way that would signal an import structur shift   the middl panel report on the perform of the backward look model  the left hand panel show model simul jump off from sever differ point in the recent past   as you can see  the simul trajectori are at least broad reminisc of the actual data   nonetheless  it is difficult to determin with the nake eye whether the model error have been predomin to one side or the other   as an aid in that diagnosi  the right hand panel use a techniqu known as the kalman filter   a statist method for allow a paramet es  to evolv over  e in respons to new inform   here  i   ve appli the kalman filter to the nairu   here   s the guid to interpret the right hand panel   if this particular model agre with the staff es  of the nairu and if everi other aspect of the model were correct specifi  the kalman filter es  would follow the same trajectori as the staff nairu   and  in fact  that is pretti much what you see   like the staff es  of the nairu  the kalman filter es  declin notic from the earli     s through the late     s and then flatten out   turn up the power on the microscop  you can see that even sinc the late     s the kalman filter es  has been declin ever so slight  signifi that inflat has been run just a littl lower dure the last eight year or so than the model would have expect   the sourc of this surpris is not identifi by the techniqu   it could  in fact  be a declin nairu  but it could equal well reflect a host of other subtl chang in the econom structur   the bottom panel repeat the experi for the part forward look model  again  as you can see on the left  the model miss mani of the finer point in the actual data but seem to captur at least the general drift  with error rough balanc to the high side and the low side   inde  as shown to the right  the kalman filter es  in this case have move essenti sideway sinc the late     s  indic that the model has not been disproportion surpris to one side or the other   exhibit   turn to the question of whether the recent increas in energi price have been seep into the structur of inflat more broad and  if so  to what extent   the top panel focus on inflat at the produc level   the panel compar the ppi for finish energi  the red line  with a staff construct aggreg of output price index for industri in which energi cost repres a relat high share of total cost   if energi price pass through were go to show up anywher  it would be here   and  as you can see  it   in fact show up   inde  this may be the statist counterpart of at least some of the anecdot that you have been hear about energi price increas be pass on to custom   on the other hand  you have also heard us report that pass through at the consum level has becom much more mute   the middl panel document that claim   for purpos of this exercis  we es  the model for core pce price inflat over roll fifteen year sampl period and then ask the model to tell us  base on those es   the predict effect of a    percent increas in the relat price of energi on core pce inflat after eight quarter   as you can see  the point es  have been lower in recent year   the bullet in the bottom panel summar our assess of this evid  current in the judgment forecast we assum that a perman    percent increas in the relat price of energi would boost core inflat about     percentag point after eight quarter   this assumpt balanc es  deriv from shorter sampl period   like the one shown in the middl panel   against es  deriv from longer sampl period that includ data from the     s and     s   our approach is valid by the observ that model that are forc to assum zero energi price pass through have been a littl surpris by how high inflat has been in the last few quarter   on the other hand  model that assum a larger pass through than the one we use judgment  consist with the averag experi over the past four decad  have been a littl surpris by how low inflat has been   our judgment assumpt tuck us neat in between   exhibit    focus on the price of owner occupi hous and it role in the formul of monetari polici   as note in the top box  two main approach to measur the price of owner occupi hous servic have been outlin in the econom literatur   the first approach aim to measur the user cost of owner occupi hous   as shown in equat    the user cost depend on imput interest expens  depreci  and the expect capit gain   for mani year  this was essenti the approach that the bls took to measur the price of owner occupi hous in the cpi  except that they ignor the expect capit gain compon  increas  howev  they and other becam dissatisfi with the user cost approach  part becaus it ignor the capit gain compon and part becaus it guarante that an increas in interest rate would caus an increas in measur inflat   final  in       they shift to the rental equival approach which  as summar in equat    aim to measur the rent that owner occup would charg themselv in an assum arm length transact   in a world in which all the relev variabl could be measur perfect and hous price were alway perfect align with fundament  the two approach would give the same answer  and equat   would hold   that equat show that rent can increas even if hous price   denot as pt   are decreas   inde  this would be expect to happen if interest rate   denot as it   were increas  all els be equal   in the real world  rent could also diverg from hous price if the latter were come down after a period of overvalu   thus  the constel of fact that we see today   a deceler ofheo price index togeth with an acceler rent index in the cpi   may not be as anomal as intuit might at first have suggest   the last two bullet in the box address the role of hous price in the conduct of monetari polici   first  a broad rang of analyst agre that someth like owner    equival rent  oer  is a theoret appropri element of a cost of live index  but second  and of more direct to concern to you  whether the fomc should defin it object relat to a cost of live index that includ oer depend on what cost you are seek to minim in your conduct of monetari polici   for exampl  to name just two possibl  you may believ that the cost of deviat from price stabil deriv main from the inabl of individu to accur take account of inflat in their long term financi plan  in which case you might want to aim to stabil an index of the overal cost of live  includ oer   on the other hand  you may believ that the cost of deviat from price stabil have more to do with the misalloc of product resourc stem from confus between real and nomin price chang  in which case you might want to focus on someth quit differ from a cost of live index   the bottom two panel turn to the oper question of more immedi consequ   name  what we expect to happen to rent in the near term   as shown in the bottom left panel  hous afford has deterior sharpli dure the past two year  suggest that rent may come under consider further upward pressur   on the other hand  the rental vacanc rate  shown as the red line  remain quit high by histor standard  suggest that ani acceler should be of moder proport   on balanc  as shown in the bottom right  we have carri forward some of the recent higher read in these categori but have taken the moder view  at least for now
in contrast to the mix news on econom activ come out of the unit state and despit the intern financi volatil that dino describ  read on foreign econom activ have been general posit   import  some of the area of the global economi that had been weak in previous year are show sign of strength   as indic by the blue line in the top left panel of exhibit     euro area industri product has been move up on balanc in recent month  buoy by solid manufactur order   the consum had been the laggard in the euro zone   s recoveri  but retail sale have edg up  and the first quarter data on german consumpt  not shown  were quit encourag   in japan  the middl panel  the rapid expans that kick in last year appear to be continu   as in the euro area  manufactur order and output have been quit strong   and after general disappoint growth for the past sever year  mexico   s economi  shown on the right  has acceler on the back of strong manufactur product  destin in larg part for the unit state   these indic support our es  that total foreign growth  line   in the middl panel  regist a healthi and broad base     percent in the current quarter  to be sure  this repres a step down from the except

 mexican gdp  have surg more than   percent in the first quarter  like has cool to a still robust     percent rate in the second  second quarter growth in the industri economi  line    is es  to have shown a more mute declin from it first quarter pace   canadian growth like slow along with the u s  economi  but japanes growth is es  to have stay strong while activ in the euro area and the unit kingdom acceler   beyond the current quarter  we see growth in the emerg market economi hold steadi while that of industri economi moder a bit further   lower u s  econom growth will restrain demand   addit  foreign econom activ will be respond to previous and prospect increas in interest rate   as shown in the bottom left panel  which present our project for key foreign polici rate  although we believ the tighten cycl is wind down in canada  it still has a way to go in the euro area  and it has yet to begin in japan   final  the recent sharp declin in global stock market  the black and purpl line on the right  as well as the increas in emerg market credit spread  the red line  will like weigh on spend in both industri and emerg market economi   were downdraft in intern financi market to continu and to intensifi  they could lead to sharp falloff in activ   for now  howev  financi market appear to be stabil with equiti price have revers onli a small part of previous steep run up and embi spread remain at histor low level   a few economi   especi turkey  south africa  and hungari   remain under pressur  but this like reflect their particular vulner rather than more general turmoil in emerg market   accord  return to the top line of the middl panel  total foreign growth is project to make a smooth land to it es  trend rate of rough    percent   this    goldilock    project for the foreign economi hing on our assess that inflat will remain contain despit continu high commod price and diminish slack   as shown on the top left panel of exhibit     averag inflat in the industri economi is project to move up a bit further in the current quarter but to then eas as the pass through of higher energi and other commod price into consum price is complet   in the emerg economi  govern polici tend to slow the respons of domest energi price to those set in world market  accord  inflat for these economi is not project to peak until later this year  after which it also move down   as shown on the right  our project  base on quot from futur market  is that price of both west texa intermedi crude oil and non energi commod will flatten out but stay elev   oil price have increas consider fa  than our import weight aggreg of non energi commod price  but some non energi price  especi those of metal such as copper  have inde move up sharpli over a short period of  e   the quarter data plot in the chart obscur the fact that  most recent  price of metal and other commod have move back down  in part becaus of the same concern about futur monetari polici and growth that have weigh on financi market   the middl left panel show spot price for copper and zinc  although these have declin sharpli  they remain extrem elev   increas in demand have been an import driver of the overal rise in commod price in the past few year   some observ have taken this rise to be a signal that the global economi is overh   inde  as shown on the right  world gdp growth  the red dash line  has been brisk in the past two year  and this growth   appear to be correl with the rate of chang of oil and other commod price   yet rise commod price are probabl not so much a symptom of general global overh as a reflect of rapid industri develop in asia  particular china   as indic in line   of the bottom left panel  china  by itself  has contribut     percentag point to global econom growth in the past three year  moreov  of the total increas in world oil consumpt  shown in line     increas in chines consumpt  shown in line    account for more than one quarter   china   s contribut to global output growth appear to have been support by correspond increas in capac   cpi inflat exclud food  the solid line in the panel on the right  has remain quit low at around   percent recent   data on overal industri capac are not avail  but we do have data for specif sector   the red cross hatch bar in the panel indic chines steel make capac  and the solid bar repres actual product   china   s steel product has soar to    percent of total global output  but by dint of extraordinari level of invest  capac has risen even more   thus  rise commod price like reflect sector bottleneck in the midst of rapid asian develop rather than a more general global overh   the top left panel of exhibit    focus on resourc util in the foreign industri economi   the solid black line repres the staff es  of the output gap   that is  the excess of actual over potenti gdp  it suggest that actual output in the industri economi is now near but not signific abov potenti   the messag that the industri economi are not overh is also support by measur of capac util rate in manufactur  express as deviat from their ten year averag  asid from japan  capac util rate in the major foreign industri economi are close to histor level   it is not possibl to construct reliabl measur of potenti output and of the output gap for the develop economi becaus the requisit data on stock of labor and especi capit are not avail   moreov  as these economi are undergo rapid structur chang  convent output gap calcul would be doubli tenuous   measur of manufactur capac util are avail for some develop economi  as shown on the right  and they point to declin level of resourc slack   whether overal gdp in these economi has move up beyond potenti  howev  is difficult to say   the middl panel present a mix pictur of recent inflat trend in three of our import trade partner   in the euro area  twelv month headlin inflat  the solid black line  has edg up in recent month  howev  both core inflat  the dot red line  and wage growth  the blue dash line  have stay subdu   in canada  headlin  core  and wage inflat have all been creep up  although core inflat remain at onli   percent   in mexico  notwithstand rise global energi price and acceler wage  both headlin inflat and core inflat have been trend down   the bottom left panel show unit labor cost   recent cost growth has been come down from high level in canada and the unit kingdom  has been reason contain in franc  and remain negat in germani   final  the right panel indic that long term inflat expect in the foreign industri economi exclud japan   whether measur by bond market breakeven rate  the black line  or semiannu survey  the red line  have remain around     percent or below  to sum up this lengthi discuss  although there is some risk of more sever upward pressur on foreign inflat  the data in hand appear to support the more benign scenario we have built into our outlook   a second key risk to the outlook center on the dollar   as indic in the top left panel of exhibit     the u s  current account deficit reach near   percent of world gdp last year  balanc primarili by surplus in japan  emerg asia  and especi the oil export countri   as shown on the right  the u s  trade balanc  while have recov a bit from it plung in the wake of hurrican katrina last fall  nevertheless remain on a deterior trend   market focus on extern imbal like explain much of the declin in the broad dollar  the black line in the middl left panel  in april and earli may   howev  the market   s attent to global extern imbal appear to fade by mid may  and the dollar has move up sinc then   neither the dollar   s declin nor it subsequ rebound could be explain by the differenti between u s  bond yield and foreign bond yield  shown on the right  which has move littl this year  the market also appar took no signal from the mid june announc of u s  balanc of payment data  shown in the bottom panel   as shown in line    the current account deficit narrow in the first quarter  reflect a smaller nomin trade deficit  reduc transfer abroad  and an improv balanc on invest incom   as for the financ of the deficit  privat foreign purchas of u s  secur  line    slow sharpli in april   howev  neither the good news about the deficit nor the potenti bad news about it financ had much of an effect on the dollar   in project the futur path of the dollar  we have wrestl with the usual tension between the need for the dollar to fall over the longer term to restor current account sustain and the fact that in the shorter term the dollar can do pretti much whatev it want   accord  as indic by the black line in the top left panel of exhibit     in our  book project the broad real dollar depreci onli about   percent annual   howev  we are keen awar that a refocus of investor attent on sustain could lead to a much steeper declin in the dollar   this exhibit compar our baselin project of the extern sector with a simul of the staff   s frb global model in which the dollar declin an addit    percent over the next year and a half  this is the same simul summar in the intern develop section of the  book   as shown on the right  our baselin project is for the trade balanc to continu to deterior for the remaind of this year but to flatten out a bit next year as oil price top out and the slow of u s  growth take effect   becaus of j curv effect  the path of the nomin trade balanc is rough similar under the altern simul  at least dure the forecast period   howev  the addit depreci lead to declin in real import and increas in real export   accord  as shown in the next row  the contribut of net export to real gdp growth  which is negat for most of next year in the baselin  becom posit under the altern simul   a more rapid depreci of the dollar would affect price as well as output   as shown on the right  in our baselin project  core import price inflat   which we project will rise to   percent in the third quarter becaus of rise commod price   deceler to   percent by the end of next year as commod price flatten out   the addit dollar depreci in the altern simul add   to   percentag point to core import inflat over the forecast period   as shown in the next row  core pce inflat rise about   percentag point  reflect both the higher import price and brisker econom activ   accord  the taylor rule in the model lead the feder fund rate to rise abov   percent by the end of next year   this squeez domest consumpt and invest somewhat and  as a result  real gdp growth in the altern simul rise a bit less than   the contribut of net export to gdp   notabl  foreign growth declin a bit less than u s  growth rise   in sum  we view a sharp declin in the dollar as unpredict but entir possibl   such an event like would lead to more u s  growth but also more inflat and a need for tighter monetari polici than current incorpor into the  book forecast
the final exhibit present your forecast for      and       compar with februari  you have edg down your project for the growth of real gdp in both year and rais your forecast of core inflat   the forecast for the unemploy rate is essenti unchang   that conclud our present  and we will be happi to answer ani of your question
ani question for our colleagu   presid
i have some more question about latent variabl   dure my exchang   with   at the last meet  i was ask about inflat expect   i learn that you didn   t have a singl number for expect inflat but that there were multipl measur   you offer to write a number down on an envelop for me but caution me against place too much relianc on it   you went on to say that there was someth call    under inflat     and you spent a good deal of  e talk about this   you even cite some number   said that it was mayb   percent or     percent in       and that it had risen perhap to   percent at the last meet   so i went and check my new palgrav  dictionari of econom   i couldn   t find    under inflat       laughter   i went to the bls websit and the bea websit  it wasn   t there either   i ask some of my theoret economist if they had seen ani paper in the literatur that have model with under inflat  and i couldn   t find anyth   so i   m wonder what it is   i   m wonder what the number is now  how it has chang sinc may  and whether it might be use inform for the committe to contempl when deliber about inflat polici
i   ll jump in  given that it look as though you   re still look at me   laughter   this may either dismay you or encourag you   i wast a great deal of staff  e in the past four or five week actual ask our folk whether or not they could creat a measur that would be use to you  verifi  and audit   we haven   t yet conclud that the answer is    no     but the task is veri complic  in part becaus our forecast  to a great extent  is a pool exercis that encompass a larg number of model     show in his present today two of those model   one that use just lag price inflat and anoth that use a combin of a weight averag  in some sens  of lag price inflat and expect inflat from the survey of profession forecast   we are also look at model that use the michigan survey and that use tip spread   the question is  is there some sort of latent concept in there that would be use to you   under inflat is a sens of both momentum and expect becaus there are cost of adjust associ with inflat and there are forward look expect   when i was talk about under inflat  i was talk about the convolut of both of those two concept   the figur i cite are veri rough   they are base on a sort of decomposit of how much we can explain by what   s been go on with slack in resourc util  product chang  energi price  import price  and a varieti of other thing   as i said  i could certain write those down for you   but i have come to the view that perhap the better thing to do is to be clear about what the raw input are that go into the forecast   i think we could expand the materi that we   re present in the  book to includ such thing as the lag price compon that might be in essenc inflat momentum or under inflat   the actual variabl that we use in frb us is a variabl that in the most recent observ use the survey of profession forecast but in histori is concaten with the hoey survey that we had in the earli     s and befor that a  e seri techniqu that sharon kozicki and   tinsley develop for us to incorpor when we es  the longer term model   i could pictur us do a better job of actual show you what the piec are that we struggl with and pool togeth in come up with a forecast   to my mind  that would be more use than give you a number   you might look at a number and think  well  it chang two tenth  so the staff must think this or that   in this pool exercis  ani number  given the standard error associ with these various model  would give    under inflat    a level of precis and import in your think that it shouldn   t have   i   d rather provid you with the input that i think will be help in give a sens of what we   re look at and what   s condit our think about the inflat outlook   so  again  we are still look at this question   with the natur rate of unemploy  for exampl  we can tell you what three coeffici in our es  model go into produc the es  there and can calcul standard error and provid you with confid interv  that   s a lot harder to do in this exercis with model with such divers es  of inflat expect and the momentum of cost of adjust   i think we can do a better job   i think we owe it to you to give you more than we current are give you   i   m still of the view  after have look at this for anoth four or five week  that give you a number on an envelop might be a greater disservic to the committe than a servic to the committe   so i hope we can improv the qualiti of the analysi without necessarili provid you with some fals level of precis or accuraci in this es
thank you veri much      i   m glad to hear that you   ve devot so much staff  e to this  and i appreci the effort   that number   expect inflat   isn   t the object   as you know  inflat dynam are central to what we do   there is signific scientif uncertainti about how polici interact with those dynam   in particular at  e like the past sever month  when inflat expect appear to fluctuat substanti   and there must be some interplay between our polici choic  communic  expect inflat  and realiz inflat   i was just look for more insight into the staff   s accumul wisdom on these topic and was take that expect inflat number as a thread to pull on to tri to elicit more visibl
well  we can give you a bunch of thread  and i hope you   ll be abl to weav them togeth    laughter
thank you veri much   i appreci that   i have one separ question for       in exhibit       pass through of energi price     the middl panel report on some empir work   when i tri to find the counterpart in the model economi for the empir exercis you do  it   s hard to pictur it not have embed within it a polici reaction function  so i wonder  are you happi with our interpret these number as measur of our credibl in some sens  or do you have chang relat to this consider over  e   i mean  isn   t that what you   re measur here
you   re entir right   both of these model are veri partial equilibrium in their extent   that   s especi true of the backward look model  which is strict a reduc form specif that take no explicit account of inflat expect   but even the part forward look model  sn   t have a sort of satellit equat that describ either the way expect are form or the conduct of monetari polici   so  yes  i   m absolut certain that there is an import interact in these es  coeffici with the credibl of monetari polici  among other factor   it   s part for that reason  as i mention in the text  that in our judgment assumpt we haven   t taken on board these point es  liter   our judgment assumpt is that  with this metric  a    percentag point increas in the relat price of energi would boost core pce inflat     percentag point   so  as you can see  that   s just a littl to the high side of the rang    now  i could produc other model at yet more expens in term of staff  e that probabl would encompass even that   certain  the standard error would well encompass that     of the assumpt   but that   s just a way of illustr that we discount a bit the point es  from these model becaus we don   t think the right messag for you to take away is that  somehow  someth has chang in the structur of the economi so that  in your conduct of monetari polici  you don   t need to respond to chang in energi price   part of the reason that these number may be as low as they are is precis becaus the committe  over the past coupl of decad  has respond forc to energi price shock and kept inflat in check
well  more broad  if we   re not to take these as exogen becaus they reflect some public sens of our reaction function  we could strive to make them zero   that is to say  to view these kind of coeffici as someth we   re go to influenc over  e
i suppos that would be a polici choic avail to you   in think about how to do that  you   d want to think about the horizon at which you would want to do this  i slice into probabl space at a horizon of eight quarter   i have no idea whether you   d want to aim to caus these shock to have zero effect after four quarter or sixteen quarter or when  but i haven   t thought serious about whether precis zero is the right effect or not   the effect is a lot smaller now than it was three decad ago  and in mani of these model specif it   s not statist signific differ from zero
is that a two hand intervent
whatev    laughter   i forget the code here  but just a littl intervent there   it may be that the effect of oil price increas on inflat is lower than it was two or three decad ago   but  say  over the past two year       to       given that we   ve had a number of oil shock  if you want to call the oil price increas that   i don   t know if they all achiev the mean of    shock      would you say that one of the key reason  if not the key reason  for the increas in core inflat over that period is energi price   it seem to me that make a differ becaus  if we think energi price are go to subsid  we can have a littl more confid about the falloff of inflat go forward   if the increas isn   t most relat to energi  then i think we can have less confid of a falloff of inflat go forward
there are mani way to do this account   but on one account  the falloff that we have in core inflat in      relat to      is due entir to the cessat of the indirect effect of energi price pass through into the core   if you look at the top right panel of exhibit    you can see that core price in      got down to a veri low rate of increas
i rememb that
a substanti part of the pickup sinc then by our calcul is due to the energi price pass through   my recollect is that it   s on the order of     or     percentag point
that   s part of what we   re think it was   a lot of this recent uptick in core is due pretti much to energi
mr  chairman  i want to thank the staff for the global present  particular for the begin of this analysi on resourc util  which as you know i find use   it is noteworthi that we   re begin a process or  mayb  continu a process and have not enough inform yet to understand or to analyz it in term of chines capac   your strike figur in exhibit    about steel product and steel capac   china now has    percent of the world   s capac   i would imagin that you   re go to see that in shipbuild and sever other sector as we go through  e   so i want to thank you for the analysi   thank you     as well   the question i have is this   if you go to exhibit    and look at your forecast for the second half of      and for      for the emerg economi  what   s strike about these number at the bottom right hand side of the tabl is that they are occur as we forecast a slow in the u s  economi   i wonder if you might comment on the linkag between the two or on what other work we have to do on that front   one would think that either emerg market gdp would slow by virtu of our slow or that they would build up their own domest consumpt   and i   m wonder about the interrelationship we build into our model between the two   again  thank you for the analysi
my pleasur   we   re keen awar of the fact that the unit state economi play a lead role in the global economi   dure the last downturn  at the begin of this decad  when the u s  economi start to slow  our european colleagu often said     well  we   re probabl not go to experi a slowdown ourselv becaus our export to the unit state  as a fraction of our gdp  are relat small      but  in the event  they did slow down becaus the unit state economi affect the world not onli through direct trade link but also through indirect trade link   europ may not trade as much with the unit state  but it certain trade with other economi that do trade with the unit state   their economi are also affect through financi channel   clear  mani financi market turn down at the begin of this decad as they are turn down now  albeit now to a lesser degre   so we   re keen awar that a slowdown in the u s  economi would affect the world economi  now  we are not build in a veri sharp slowdown for the world economi becaus we think that the condit don   t merit that at this  e   in the emerg market economi  the fundament are realli quit strong except in certain economi that are under a lot of pressur  in the industri economi  two of the main area   the euro area and japan   had been weak in the past and are strengthen now   so  as i say  we don   t see a sharp slowdown as the most like outcom  although there is a risk of that   at the same  e  it   s import to note that we are build in a moder slowdown for the total world economi  from about   percent in the second half of      and the first quarter of this year to about    percent by the end of the forecast period   it may not sound like a great deal  but when you aggreg the entir world economi  a percentag point chang is more meaning than it might be for an individu economi   so we   re veri awar of the linkag between the unit state and the rest of the world and feel we have taken those into account
if i could just rephras the question   is it reason to assum that the emerg economi that you list would maintain these rate were we to slow down signific
do you mean would they slow down more than is embed in our baselin forecast
that seem quit like the case   if the u s  economi were to slow to a signific greater degre than embodi in the baselin forecast  probabl mani economi  particular the asian economi that depend on us veri heavili for their export market  would inde slow down much more than we are anticip at this  e
it   s not a straightforward thing to calcul in some sens   the world   seem to have two engin instead of one   that is to say  we would argu strong that the global experi in the late     s would not provid a clear  accur benchmark for what we would think today   china  in particular  has reach a status and an independ from the unit state that wasn   t present in the     s  and to the extent that it has achiev a certain dynam in domest demand  in a reorient of product in asia that has veri close link those economi with china  the chines economi has  if you will  a momentum or a dynam to it that is not total depend on the unit state and so could  inde  continu to grow rapid if the u s  economi were to slow  nonetheless  forecast what will happen is a bit more of an art than a scienc becaus to some degre  for exampl  invest in these economi  while it is measur as a compon of domest demand  is undertaken with an eye toward export sale   so the interact of consum confid  of prospect for export  and of relat price chang that shift the term of trade for some of these economi all have to be factor into the project  and i   m sure we don   t get it precis right by ani mean   but i would just say that  at the present  e  the extent to which other sourc of strength are aris in differ part of the global economi is  we think  an accur represent  say  in comparison with ten year ago
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i have two question   one is just a quick one on steel sinc presid   mention exhibit    and you show this big increas in china   s steel capac in         much greater than the annual steel product increas   and i have heard about this a lot   but steel price in the unit state are stay surpris high accord to industri observ  and they are expect to go higher this year   i was just wonder if you could shed some light on what   s happen to the price of steel  the other question i have is broader   it   s realli about the overal forecast   this is one of the largest midyear revis to the forecast that i rememb see sinc i   ve been here  in the gdp number particular   clear  some of the data that have come in have been softer  but it seem to be more than just that   there seem to be a chang in the tone of the  book that suggest some reassess of the under strength of the economi   that is the way i read it   but you know  there is some good news here  too   product growth remain solid   real interest rate are just in the middl of the neutral zone   anecdot i hear are realli quit posit   so i felt a disconnect when i read the  book  and i was just wonder if you could elabor on this a bit to help me understand this chang in tone of the  book
i will answer the small question   then larri can answer the big one   laughter   i agre with you that there is actual a certain disjunctur  if you will  between the fact that steel price have stay up and the grow capac in china   i don   t have a full answer to your question  but i would offer just a coupl of thought   the first is that  unlik a homogen primari commod  steel come in mani form  and there are differ market   so the veri substanti increas in chines capac in some product don   t necessarili lead to price declin in other product that may be particular import to the unit state   the second point to mention  which is much more obvious  is that iron ore price actual have gone up veri signific  accord to the data that we   re look at  basic they are    percent higher than they were a year earlier   what seem to be go on is some tension between increas in ore price  on the one hand  and improv in capac  on the other hand  which might reduc the margin between the ore and the final steel product   perhap those circumst will go some way toward explain the anomali
let me start  and then dave may want to add a few comment as well  clear  we did revis down the forecast   the downward revis was base in part  as i said in my brief  not onli on the incom data but also on some of the other factor that i highlight in exhibit     but i also want to emphas that the news wasn   t uniform bad as it came in   some good news came in as well  which i tri to point out   what we have done is to take down the rate of growth rough    percentag point begin in the third quarter and move to the end of the project period  in larg part  i   d say  becaus of the disappoint develop in the hous sector but becaus of other thing  such as weaker consumpt news  as well   i would also say that we don   t see this cumul   we   ve weaken the forecast  but we don   t see the economi fall apart   we continu to see an economi that  as i said  was in a transit to a rate of growth that will be below potenti   we just mark it down further below potenti than we had in the last  book   but i don   t think that there   s a disconnect between what we   ve done and the news that we have receiv   i do not know  dave  if you have addit comment
it   s a big revis  and as you can imagin  we agon a lot about    isn   t this is a big revis for just six week of inform      the problem we confront was that  if just the incom data had been wors than we thought  we would not have made a revis as larg as this   but in each case  the weak in the data was be reinforc by weaker read in the under fundament for those sector   in consumpt  for exampl  we have had a string of weak number   we lost     billion worth of incom in downward revis in the fourth quarter and the first quarter  and we   re start out with a much lower save rate than we thought   the stock market when we close the  book was off   percent   those were big fundament   and hous  for the most part  continu to come in wors than we thought   although new home sale came in a bit abov our expect  start were below what we had in may  and the permit were continu to come down   even in this forecast  we basic have hous activ not declin a whole lot further in term of hous start go forward from where they are today   so we could see some downsid risk still to that   if you ask where i think some of the vulner might be and how we could get to august and not be look at a forecast as weak as this  i can imagin that by the end of the next week we could get         on payrol employ with some upward revis   we could get a strong retail sale report for june with a littl upward revis   this is all go to look a bit as though we overreact   thing weren   t so strong  but in each case it was not as though we had actual data or fundament that we could hold onto to tell us not to revis as much as we did   so we thought we had thing reason well balanc in this case   i could see more downsid risk than upsid risk to our hous forecast  the risk around our consumpt forecast look pretti balanc to me   on the one hand  given how low the save rate is and some recent weaken in employ growth  i could see how thing could come in lower   on the other hand  it is easi to see that the consum has been more resili in recent year and could continu to be so   so i see the risk there as more balanc   on the busi sector side  howev  i probabl see a littl more upsid risk than downsid risk to the forecast   in the end  we felt as though we were compel by our normal analyt apparatus to produc a forecast that was notic weaker than the last  e  even though the revis look big and show a forecast that chang as much in such a short  e certain made us veri nervous  so i think you are right to be a bit taken aback by how much we revis in a short period  howev  i still think the forecast probabl has both upsid and downsid risk to it
it is veri differ from what i am hear from peopl
i want to reinforc a littl of what larri said   in this forecast  growth is just a bit below potenti  there is a modest rise in the unemploy rate over the next six or seven quarter in the context of interest rate that have increas consider and a fiscal polici that was swing from consider s ulus to some restraint   industri product is continu to increas at a reason solid pace   so i don   t view this forecast as tell a cyclic weaken stori to ani great extent   it   s just a soften to below trend   that may still be inconsist with the anecdot you   re hear   certain in the industri sector  in nonresidenti construct  and even in busi fix invest  the anecdot out there do sound quit posit at this point
this is a question for   or for     in monday   s intern brief you refer  and i   ll quot  to the possibl that we may be    near limit on global capac    when you were discuss foreign inflat prospect   i   m realli follow up on presid     s question here   i want just to clarifi what your think is about how global capac figur into those foreign inflat forecast that you make and then potenti into u s  inflat   one model might be that inflat in each countri depend main on the countri   s own domest capac or unemploy along with some role for import price   if so  you might refer to global capac as just an averag of the state of foreign labor market  possibl driven by some common extern forc that   s drive global growth in all the countri   an altern is that you might feel that there is some role for global capac in the inflat process abov and beyond how it may affect import price   that   s  i guess  the view that presid   has put forward  and it is interest endors in the bis annual report that came out ye day
yes  it certain is
i mean  this is a larg topic  but i don   t mean to ask too larg a question   i just want to clarifi what your think is  especi when you use that term
whi don   t i give an overview   then   can speak a bit about where we think we are   the topic has obvious becom of great interest   it   s crop up in ani number of place  includ the bis   when we think about it  the first problem we confront is that we were never abl in the simpler world of ten year ago or so to get phillip curv that were the least bit accept for almost ani foreign industri countri you could name   there was alway great tension in intern meet  in research effort  in convers that we would have with central bank staff in some of these countri  and so forth to reconcil the way we thought about inflat and the forc drive inflat becaus they didn   t think in term of slack and price pressur   if you go back far enough  obvious they had a lot of faith  somehow  in money growth or medium term thing   the oecd has tri often   inde  peopl on my staff have tri often   to identifi role for gap  in mani of the european countri anyway   these thing we call speed effect   which indic that what matter is how fast you   re chang  not whether you have a lot of slack in resourc but how quick are you close that gap    alway seem to loom larg in certain countri  and effect of gap were veri hard to find   for exampl  the whole period of japanes deflat defi explan in term of a phillip curv that has ani kind of reason properti  or the deflat would have gotten wors and wors and wors over a long period of  e  and it did not   so you   re start from a world in which the link between capac as we normal think about it and inflat were never strong and never common share across a rang of countri  now we add a level of complex in that we have a more global economi   we have had what amount to a big  posit suppli shock of labor  at the veri least via the china india former soviet union line of reason  and sudden peopl are now make argument and es  equat in which a global capac measur is behav better than i could ever find individu capac measur to appli in these countri   it leav me in a bit of a quandari  i was in basel over the weekend   the bis releas it annual report in  e for it annual general meet  and i was lucki enough to find myself seat at lunch next to the author of some of the work   i said     you know  i can   t imagin a variabl that realli captur what i think of as the rang of effect that someth like china might have and china   s labor forc might have on the process of price in the global economi   you have this paper that you   ve written  and it   s reflect in the annual report  and you have five differ measur           he basic repli that they haven   t solv that problem and that the measur they use  in and of themselv  could readili be critic  but they got some result   he swore to me that they had beaten on this equat with everi possibl negat rational that would explain it other than be valid  and it still kept come back at them as though someth was there  so i guess i am prepar now to look a littl harder and tri some of this ourselv  which we have been pretti skeptic about do   but there   s a big gap between the notion that there are     million chines who might potenti be engag in global econom activ and the realiti of what   s determin price in real  e today   the fact that these peopl are potenti there but are nowher to be seen other than in the rural area of china  grow their own food  just make it veri difficult to think that one has captur someth  so i am certain sympathet with the notion that there are key bottleneck   there are some featur through the commod market or there are some other aspect within manufactur in particular sector where you see global capac effect   but disentangl the relat price piec of this stori from someth that might relat to the interact of overal capac and inflat is veri  veri difficult   i think we   re just begin to do that   in term of this outlook    may want to make a few comment about where we think we see global growth and how that might matter
just to extend     s remark a bit   as   suggest  we have for quit a while had a certain amount of difficulti identifi a standard phillip curv relationship between domest output gap and inflat in all foreign economi   we have done research in our divis over the past few year  and we actual have identifi various type of relationship between gap and inflat in mani industri economi   they tend to differ from economi to economi   in some  an output gap will matter  in other  a chang in an output gap will matter   so there realli isn   t a one size fit all approach toward predict inflat in the foreign economi  and we don   t use one   we use differ approach in differ economi tailor as to what seem to work  so base on that  in term of ask what particular concept of capac under the statement in our brief on monday  the answer is that it   s one that   not take a stand on your particular issu   it depend on the economi   i should say we are  as   suggest  veri awar of the work that the bis has done  which show extraordinarili import effect of the global output gap measur on domest inflat rate   as   point out  that work has quit a few conceptu flaw in term of how one realli measur the output gap in economi where that concept is so ill defin   on top of that  some veri tenuous preliminari research that we   ve done seem to indic that the equat themselv  depend on the  e period and the definit of the left hand side depend variabl  are not quit as robust as their author suggest   so we veri much leav open the possibl that some measur of global capac may  inde  be import  but we are veri far from be abl to pin that effect down
quick  just as an extens to presid     s question   if you look at the econom project  particular for       the staff   s forecast is sort of low on gdp  middl to high on core pce  but right up there over the central tendenc on the unemploy rate   i think this come under the head of the surpris in this staff forecast versus what we   ve been see earlier this year   and i   m tell the truth here   i think our project in boston were closer to your than what i see here in the central tendenc   so it   s not that i   m object tremend to your forecast  but one element i did find a littl off put and i want to ask a question about is the relationship of how much your unemploy rate rise  go up from     to      to the path of the gdp forecast  even recogn that it   s    percentag point slower than an earlier forecast   that may be not your start point   i recogn that   but it   seem like a big chang even given the slower pace of gdp growth
we   ve had an error in     s law in the level relationship between the output gap and the unemploy rate gap   the predomin explan for what you   re talk about is that we have the relationship between the output gap and the differ between the unemploy rate and the nairu come back into normal align   let me tri to put that into english   at the moment we have an output gap that we think is just close  but we have an unemploy rate that is below the nairu   that align is not normal   even if the output gap just stay where it is right now  we would expect the unemploy rate   nairu combin on averag to come back into normal align   so we would get some lift in the unemploy rate just out of that  as that abnorm align work out of the system
and is that what is pull down inflat   is that have an effect on your core pce
as i mention earlier  the predomin thing that   s caus core pce to deceler next year compar with this year is the flatten out of energi price   resourc util is a tini influenc at this point
so you   re basic agnost about the output gap   or the lack thereof    and what you see in the current unemploy rate   you don   t believ it becaus it   s out of whack with where you think it ought to be vis  vis the nairu
i   m not sure i   d use the word    agnost      we think that both the output gap and the unemploy rate gap are pretti small   given how flat the phillip curv is  we think they   re veri slight influenc on the perform of inflat over the remaind of this year and next  and we think other factor are go to loom larger in push inflat either up or down from where it is now
two other interpret of the recent read   one interpret is that     s law is off and we   ll get some increas in the unemploy rate   anoth possibl is that the nairu is lower than we   re es    in that case there would be no gap in the unemploy rate       percent might equal the     on the natur rate  and the output gap would be zero   that obvious has  as we have illustr in the  book  benefici implic for inflat go forward and probabl will produc a lower inflat forecast   a second altern is that potenti gdp growth may have been slower than we thought   we got more of a declin in the unemploy rate with less gdp growth   if that were the case go forward  obvious it would impli higher futur inflat   again  within the normal error of     s law   despit it name    law     it   s a pretti loos empir relationship  laughter    we don   t realli see it necessarili call into question our es  yet   but i do think there are reason altern interpret of what   s happen recent to the one that we are provid in the  book
yes   the second one would make inflat a littl stickier
well  if we could  i would like to start the econom go round  if at all possibl  i would like to complet that today so everyon could get a chanc to speak today  rememb we have a two hand intervent   if you   d like to make a comment or ask a question  pleas rais two hand   otherwis  one hand put you in the queue for your comment   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   econom growth in the fifth district eas off the throttl a bit sinc our last meet   our june manufactur survey releas ye day morn continu to show near flat activ   index for shipment and new order were bare posit  essenti unchang from may  and down from strong read for march and april   the servic sector  on the other hand  continu to display solid growth  with overal servic revenu right on their three month averag and retail sale rebound after a dip in may   howev  our big ticket index  which is domin by car sale  remain weak   employ index for both servic and manufactur were posit in june  with a slight declin in the servic sector but a substanti gain in manufactur   district hous market remain reason strong   sale and construct activ have continu to slip from last year   s level in mani area  but our contact do not seem surpris or panick  and we continu to get report of a pickup in commerci construct activ   price pressur remain elev in the fifth district  and expect for manufactur price trend dure the next six month remain about where they have been sinc last fall  rough   percent for price paid and   percent for price receiv   in the servic sector  expect price increas for the next six month exceed     percent for the second month in a row  set a new record high for this twelv year old index  turn to the nation economi  the  book present  as presid   note  a distinct differ pictur from six week ago  perhap most notabl with regard to consum spend   lower growth of household incom sinc the middl of last year has led the staff to reduc it es  of the level of real dispos incom this quarter   percent  and they have reduc their es  of consumpt this quarter     percent   the  book also mark down consumpt growth    percent in the second half of       and   percent in        now  it is certain reason to expect lower current incom to affect current consumpt expenditur  but i am inclin to revis my outlook for consumpt growth by less than the  book   growth in real dispos incom is forecast to bounc back in the second half   so the first half declin look more like a perman reduct in the level of incom than a perman reduct in the growth rate of incom   i would have expect a correspond effect on the path of consumpt  a one  e reduct in the level  with less of a reduct in forecast growth rate  the same reason for me appli to the downward revis that has been made to current household wealth  this quibbl asid  the outlook for the real side of the economi is softer than at the  e of our last meet  but it still strike me as broad consist with sustain growth fluctuat around a trend near   percent   true  hous market activ has fallen more rapid sinc the last meet than mani  includ the  book author  had expect  but the rate of declin has not fallen outsid a rang that at the begin of the year would have seem plausibl   while the recent weaker than expect employ report suggest slower job growth go forward  the  book employ forecast seem reason well align with demograph and labor forc particip trend   so on the whole  i would say that  despit the recent evolut of the econom outlook as impli by incom inform  the real side of the forecast   not seem out of the ordinari or terribl unsatisfactori to me  the inflat pictur  on the other hand    stand out and demand some attent   we have just seen our worst three month perform on the core cpi in more than eleven year      percent  and the core pce number are like to be equal unfavor   i agre with the  book   s assess that special factor  such as owner    equival rent  do not excus recent cpi behavior   fortun for us  inflat expect have declin recent   the survey measur and tip spread have moder somewhat sinc our last meet   still  inflat expect appear to be fluctuat around a level suggest pce inflat abov   percent  moreov  the  book forecast now has year over year core pce inflat remain at     percent throughout the forecast period   to me this forecast is unaccept  to forecast a bulg to     percent follow by a return to below   percent  as the  book use to earlier this year  is one thing  but a plan for core inflat of more than   percent a year and a half from now is anoth thing entir   sure in an eighteen month period we can improv that outcom  but i will leav until tomorrow a discuss of our polici option   for now i just want to note that recent event provid some strike evid that i think is like to have an import bear on our strategi in the near term  lead up to our last meet  there were sever instanc in which market had respond to incom news by mark up expect inflat and mark down the expect polici path  which i took as evid of instabl in market particip    view about our intent regard inflat   similar instabl was evid in the immedi aftermath of hurrican katrina as well  sinc the last meet  increas in the expect polici path have coincid with communic by the committe via statement  minut  speech  and interview   this was document in this week   s board brief  the same appear to be true of reduct in expect inflat  i think   i take this recent histori as evid that expect regard inflat and the conduct of monetari polici are to a signific extent forward look and can be influenc by our communic   as i point out earlier this year  the extent to which expect are view as forward look or backward look could well influenc the desir of various polici option  especi how ambiti one want to be about bring inflat back in line   i also take the recent histori as suggest the import of clarifi the public   s understand of how we intend to conduct polici  even if we cannot provid definit advanc guidanc about the numer valu of futur polici rate set   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  uncertainti about the outlook for both growth and inflat has increas   clear the inflat data are disappoint  but let me first focus on econom growth   here the key question is how much of the second quarter weak is transitori and how much repres a more fundament soften in activ   so with regard to the consum  we share the  book   s assess that increas in consum expenditur will recov somewher close to a rate of   percent in the second half of this year   qualit  this seem to be the assess of our contact as well   one  a major builder and oper of shop mall throughout the unit state  said that retail at mall have been quit pleas with the first five month of the year   although they are expect slower growth in the second half  they did not think that the falloff would be veri larg   the automak report that june sale are relat soft but better than in may  and they kept their forecast for light vehicl for the year as a whole around      million or      million unit  which mean they expect the second half of the year to be similar to the first half   this was also the consensus of the twenti four industri analyst at our annual automot outlook symposium that we held last month  look at the fundament  like the  book we think that growth in real incom will be adequ to support the project pace of spend   under the baselin path for oil price  energi price should turn from a negat to a neutral factor for real incom growth  though this is certain an area of great uncertainti   also  tight labor market should eventu generat somewhat larger increas in wage  which should help offset the effect on overal incom growth of somewhat slower gain in employ   here i should note that we do not think that the recent slowdown in job growth is the start of a deterior in the labor market   our contact at manpow studi this issu recent in respons to skeptic wall street analyst who thought that the labor market was soften and that this would be reflect in a weaken temp sector   he studi forti major market and found no sign of cutback in hire plan by his custom  and his busi continu to grow at a modest pace   given our view of the trend in particip rate and other factor  we think that the         per month gain in payrol employ that we have seen over the past coupl of month are consist with an economi grow near potenti  henc with littl chang in labor market slack  of cours  hous market are weaken   at the last meet we were more pessimist than the  book   this  e  with it larg revis  the  book is slight more pessimist than we are   howev  the overal negat tone of the  book seem a bit puzzl to me given the current condit that we were discuss earlier   after all  mortgag rate are not that high  the rate of hous price appreci has not come down more than we expect   still  current condit are soften   a contact from a major nation builder  pult home  told us that their new order had drop sharpli and that the current high level of construct is be support by work off backlog   accord  he expect a more mark slowdown in build in       in the busi sector  the report from the manufactur outsid auto were  in general  veri upbeat   most indic that order and backlog for invest good were quit high   one of my director  who is from a larg  diversifi manufactur firm and who has alway been cautious about futur capit spend  said that demand for long lead  e capit good now is as strong as he has seen in his thirti year in busi   and the pickup in nonresidenti construct is partial offset the weaker activ on the residenti side  final  financi condit continu to be favor   inde  given the recent increas in inflat  real short term interest rate are in the middl of the neutral rang  as shown in the bluebook   long term borrow cost are relat low  and we still hear that there   s a lot of liquid flow through the financi system   so we think the outlook for busi invest look solid and somewhat stronger over the cours of       than the  book forecast  to summar our outlook for real activ  we think that the economi has somewhat stronger under momentum than the  book    and we are look for growth at a pace of around   percent in the second half of this year  with regard to inflationari pressur  mani of our contact express concern about input cost   we heard numer report this round of manufactur that were pass on materi cost increas to their custom   in the chicago purchas manag survey  which will be releas this friday  the price paid compon shot up from      in may to      in june  and the overal index move down from      to       capac constraint also appear to be more common   for exampl  given industri consolid  airlin load factor are veri high  and one major carrier indic that it had been abl to increas price more than enough to cover higher fuel cost   we also receiv some report that shortag of skill labor were hold back product   still  there were few sign of acceler wage pressur  of cours  the incom data on consum price have been disappoint  as     just said  and as a result our indic model   s forecast of core pce inflat in       were revis up about     percentag point  to between     and     percent   the higher project is from the model es  use data sinc       the lower number is from the es  use data onli sinc       we think inflat this year will come in closer to the     percent figur as some of the cost pass through that has alreadi boost price run it cours  look to        the model   s project rose a tenth or two from the previous forecast   the predict use the post      sampl is     percent  wherea the long sampl project is     percent   so in the absenc of some good news on the energi or materi cost front  i do not think that inflat will be head into the bottom half of that rang unless growth next year come in a good deal below potenti   at   percent  my forecast for gdp growth in       is a bit below potenti   my forecast for pce inflat is     percent   this outlook is condit on my view of appropri polici  which is a slight higher path for the fund rate than current built into the  book becaus i feel that     percent inflat is too high  so i assum that appropri polici should attempt to arrest this acceler
ani comment on gm   s brutal outlook    laughter
well  it   s brutal compar with last year at this  e becaus they had an employe incent price program last year  which they   re not go to have this year   it   s an interest situat becaus they say that chrysler has announc that they   re go to have some higher incent   i spoke to the ceo of general motor   he claim that they   re tri to hold the line on these incent and keep them below the veri high level they   ve had these past few year  they are not go to cut price as they have in previous year   we   ll see whether they   re abl to do this  but that   s their state posit now

thank you  mr  chairman   i continu to think the outlook for the nation economi is reason posit   as best i can judg  hous activ is slow larg as expect   the pace of increas of home price is deceler   price may be declin in some market  but sure if we had put confid interv around our earlier forecast of hous activ and of price behavior  what we are current observ would have fallen within those interv   other compon of aggreg demand look reason well maintain to me   in this regard  comment from our director and from other with whom i have talk indic that  except for the agricultur sector  persist high energi price are have at most a modest negat effect on busi activ   moreov  and equal import in my mind  the respect path of product and of aggreg hour suggest to me that the economi should continu to expand at a respect pace go forward   to sum up  my forecast of real activ is for slight more growth than the  book this year  and there is a wider posit diverg between my forecast and the  book forecast for       in this regard  i have tend at these meet to emphas the under resili and flexibl of the economi   i still have a lot of confid in those characterist  and i think they augur well for the longer run perform of the economi   but i have been ask myself whether i am too sanguin about this   is there more to the second quarter slow in growth or to persist high energi price or to the hous situat   is there more to be concern about than my previous statement might suggest  my tentat answer to that question is that i think we should not be over concern at the moment about the econom outlook in term of growth for sever reason   as i alreadi suggest  the effect of persist high energi price  although not trivial  do not appear to be devast either   furthermor  the financi system remain sound and flexibl   interest rate for the most part are still relat favor  and those factor should help to sustain demand both from household and from busi   i think it is worth recal that situat at this point  certain banker report  at least typic  fierc competit for custom in the current environ  final  the low level of initi claim for unemploy insur as well as anecdot  from our district at least  suggest continu expans in employ  on the price front  howev  current circumst and the outlook do not now appear to me to be favor   earlier i had thought that the acceler in core inflat that we were observ was like to be similar to the experi in earli       when we had an acceler but it was relat quick revers   but a quick revers  sn   t look all that like to me at the moment for sever reason   first of all  as peopl have alreadi comment  the recent surpris have been on the upsid  and in light of that  i have to conclud that there is a bit more under momentum to inflat than i earlier thought   i have the sens that other central bank around the world are see and respond to the same thing   if this assess is correct and there is more inflationari momentum  then the bulk of the analyt work that has been done seem to suggest rather strong that arrest that momentum or revers it is not go to be easi in the short run  inflationari expect appar have not deterior recent  and here i am refer to the past coupl of year  but i am not sure i would make the same statement with regard to the path of inflationari expect relat to the earlier year of this decad   overal  i have the impress that  on the margin  a littl more inflat is both character the economi and be accept by household and by busi
thank you   presid
well  mr  chairman  last  e i describ the economi from our perspect as a bmw z  road  that just couldn   t keep itself from exceed the speed limit   base on the seri of call we made in prepar for this meet and the beig book and what we are see in our own district  i would say that the real economi has downshift   but as presid   said and as i understood presid   and certain presid  n to have said   not to the degre that is project in the  book   i would also say that  just to kill the analog  the inflat pressur gaug needl is move upward  i do talk to the ceo of two of the largest homebuild compani  and the way i would describ their perspect is that they have migrat from amnesia to d©j vu   clear  the kind of number that you are project seem to be confirm in term of the default rate still run abov    percent   yet some market within the countri have great strength   texa  the  ina  the pacif northwest   which is offset the weak in the northeast  the desert area  california  and so on  acknowledg that  i would like just to turn to what we are pick up from the other  nonhous sector   i would summar their view by quot the ceo of cadburi schwepp  he said that he has heard a great deal about stagflat     the   stag    is definit not there  the   flation    is increas      the ceo of ed  who has as his client gm and delphi  said     you hear a lot about quarter to quarter slowdown   i   m not see it in the general economi     my ship contact report that the rate for panamax ship  which i talk about earlier becaus panamax is the most liquid of the bulk carrier and perhap the best indic  rose from         at the last meet to         last week   all the shipper to whom i spoke are revis upward the volum that they expect to ship as well as the revenu they expect to generat  the rail report that they expect the rise in second quarter gdp to be around   percent in term of their activ level  up from the first quarter   one indic is that burlington northern santa fe report have ship         unit a week onli one  e in       nine  e in       and sixteen  e this year to date  with an acceler in april  may  and june  i think all of us saw fedex   s number that were report   i spoke at length with the cfo of up  who report that sale were up   percent in the first quarter   as of last week they are forecast closer to   percent for the second quarter   the cfo said that    there is no dramat slowdown that we can observ      the chairman of an airlin that move    million passeng  who last  e worri aloud about a slowdown that they were see in california  say that in term of realist book  across the nation it is strong without except and confirm presid     s point about be abl to have some price power   yet becaus of capac constraint in the industri as a whole  this firm is still see strong demand and strong growth potenti  the retail  i would say  are divid into two group   the higher price point continu to do well   to quot the ceo of jcpenney     what i am see through my busi is not what i am hear on cnbc or hear from the wall street analyst      on the other hand  those at the lower price point   and i have two extrem here    eleven and wal mart  in term of their averag sale and size   are clear come under pressur due to gasolin price   but one thing that i heard in talk with the ceo of the world largest retail was that    there is a lot of price pressur     and for the first  e i heard the follow     we have price power  and we are pass it through     you see this statement confirm in term of the anecdot evid we   re receiv from those that suppli retail  compani like cadburi schwepp  frito lay  and kimber clark   the ceo of kimber clark report that  again  demand is good on the demand side  but the cost front continu to worri them   regard electron  texa instrument is expect a better second quarter than a first quarter   in cell phone  the most signific price increas they have been abl to pass through in sever year are now be put into the marketplac  one ray of sunshin on the price front is in the health care sector   accord to hewitt   s new report   as you know  mr  chairman  this is the  e of year in which they are negoti the settlement for the price of health care to compani for next year   there has been a constant wrench or ratchet down of the increas in those price  from      percent in       to     percent in        and they expect to go anoth percentag point downward this year  in summari  we  like the previous report  have a littl disson with the  book in term of growth   we don   t see as sharp a correct in the second quarter and look forward  we are  howev  concern about inflat   as you know  we look at the trim mean pce deflat in dalla   it has been run at a rate of about     percent   but no matter how you measur it  inflat is run abov   percent   we   ve ask ourselv  and done some analysi  about where the inflat pressur is come from   the fraction of price weight by expenditur increas at annual rate of zero to   percent has been squeez  wherea the fraction of price increas at annual rate abov   percent has grown   compar with decemb       accord to our analysi  mr  chairman  the fraction of price increas abov   percent has risen from    percent to    percent   the fraction with price increas abov   percent has risen from    to    percent  and small price increas have becom the except  when you ask where the pressur are come from   it   s a littl like agatha christi   s murder on the orient express   they all did it   all of these price seem to be move  and we do seem to be see  for the first  e  a confirm from our privat sector contact that price expect are roll into price behavior  one last comment   i spoke earlier and other have spoken about liquid in the marketplac  and i report about the desir of one util to put togeth a     billion project that will entail    million manhour   they rais     billion for the project   the money is now in the bank  nonrecours financ at     basi point over libor   also  you may have seen that anadarko is effect a merger or  rather  an acquisit of two separ compani   the ceo of anadarko is on our board   he report that they rais     billion    at breathtak speed      inde  in both transact  three hous chose to do the entir transact in hous   that is my report  mr  chairman
presid    who were the respond in that survey you were quot about price chang
for health care
no   you were talk about what share of price chang were abov   percent
well  actual we have that on our websit  mr  chairman   i   d be happi to give you the report   these are the breakdown of all the differ expenditur compon within the pce
i   d be happi to provid that analysi
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   much like the  book  the report that i hear from my director and busi contact are consist with an economi that is expand  but at a slower pace than earlier this year   activ relat to residenti real estat has soften  and i continu to hear from my busi contact that they are concern that consum spend will retrench in respons to the softer hous market and higher energi price   but i do not get much indic that this concern is have a substanti effect on their busi plan   capit spend plan in particular seem littl chang from the begin of this year  as for inflat  rise cost are wide report by my busi contact  but most of these pressur are still relat to energi and materi price   i continu to hear that product adjust wage pressur remain in check   among produc of intermedi good  the number of firm that report the abil to pass through cost seem to be increas  but as of now  i am not hear a lot in the way of substanti price increas at the retail level  despit what i am hear from my busi contact  the data tell a differ stori  and they have affect my think sinc our last meet   the core inflat number have been drift up  whether calcul by exclud food and energi or by the trim mean and median cpi measur that we monitor in cleveland   sinc decemb the major of item in the cpi weight by their expenditur share have risen at annual rate in excess of   percent   it is still possibl  of cours  that the pattern of these price increas that have been show up late is just an outsiz but transitori pass through of energi and commod price or the realign of rent to the except residenti hous market that we have seen in the past few year   but this explan is becom increas difficult for me to defend  at our may meet i express concern that risk were weight against both our object  and the  book baselin now reflect those concern   weaker econom growth and higher inflat   at this  e  i do not see ani sign that the real economi is go to be weaker than project in the  book baselin  but unfortun i do not expect an inflat outlook that is much better than the  book baselin either   that is my report  mr  chairman   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   my view of the outlook has not chang signific sinc the last meet   general speak  i agre that  while we will have continu growth in gdp  we also will experi the begin of a declin and below trend growth probabl through some of the remaind of this year and into       inde  in my view  there are increas sign that the combin of tighter monetari polici and higher energi cost is begin to slow the economi   s momentum   there are clear signal that hous has begun to weaken   moreov  the behavior of asset price and risk premium in financi market suggest that credit cost have risen and market liquid is at least begin to see some pressur   also  it is worth note that mani other central bank are move to a more restrict polici stanc  suggest that slower growth is the like outcom for other countri as well as our over the period ahead  as we discuss the econom outlook and monetari polici  i believ we must understand how our polici action might affect the economi   often  we do focus on the long end of the yield curv   certain i do   howev  i believ it is also import to focus attent on the shorter side   longer term rate continu to be unusu low   short term rate have risen in lockstep with the fed fund rate   consequ  mani consum and mani small busi that have loan tie to prime have seen sharpli higher rate over the past coupl of year   in respons  consum have scale back their use of home equiti loan fair signific over the past few month   in addit  the repric of low rate adjust loan continu to affect household discretionari spend  and it will begin to show up in pressur on small busi  evid from the tenth district is general consist with the nation econom trend  through may  district busi activ continu to be strong  as other have said  especi in manufactur and in energi  of cours  for us   labor market in much of our district remain tight  howev  while busi are experienc strong cost pressur for materi and wage  they have  as far as we can see in some of our respons  been unabl to realli push higher price as much as they would like   as a result  some profit margin are under pressur  and our most recent manufactur survey indic that mani firm have scale back some of their capit spend plan from earlier project   as in the nation economi  the district   s hous activ has begun to slow   hous permit have drop sharpli over the past sever month  and the inventori of unsold home has risen notabl in mani of the metro area of our region  turn to the inflat outlook  i find the recent pickup in core measur of inflat to be troubl   howev  i continu to think that much of the recent increas reflect long past action in monetari polici and some of the other result combin of pass through energi cost and the weaker dollar   consequ  although we are like to see more month of elev inflat read  i believ that inflat will like declin over the forecast period  assum that we are hold at a firm   i should say a slight firm   monetari polici   under these assumpt  i would expect core pce inflat to declin from about     this year to     next year  the topic of inflat expect has receiv consider attent  but i see littl evid that expect have chang signific  at least so far   long run survey measur of expect inflat remain anchor around     percent for cpi   moreov  although the tip data suggest that inflat risk premium are somewhat higher than they were earlier this year  these premium do remain low by histor standard   thank you
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   while recent data show that sixth district econom activ was solid in the earli spring  anecdot report for may and june point to some definit deceler   the deceler is particular evid in hous  where an order slow is now note for the first  e in area outsid florida   report from florida  especi from the hotter market  of signific weak singl famili and multifamili sale have also continu dure the intermeet period   it is especi noteworthi that both residenti and nonresidenti construct in hurrican prone area is now be sever affect by insur problem  underwrit are increas unwil to write insur  and those who will write it are ask for gigant increas in premium  hous price are not fall quit as much as the declin in sale and the rise in unsold inventori might suggest   we are get report that builder are now make concess and provid upgrad  such as marbl countertop and other extra  and in one case even throw in a free mini cooper to sweeten the deal  laughter  rather than reduc price   so real hous price may be declin more than the data suggest   the insur problem are affect exist busi as well   we are get report that premium for wind damag coverag are more than doubl  and in some area we have heard report of increas substanti larger than that  some slow is also evidenc in other area besid hous   consumpt appear to be less strong than it was in the earli spring  with most of the recent deceler in consum spend appear to be focus on lower end retail   the most frequent heard explan is the higher price of gasolin   manufactur remain mix  and for the first  e in year  some build suppli produc outsid hurrican area are expect busi to slow in come month  price increas continu to be note at the produc level  especi for construct materi  petroleum product  metal  and fuel   even with the declin in natur gas price   firm are rais their final price as much as they can  given the competit environ  and fuel surcharg remain in place  but in short  this is more of the same on the price front  redevelop from last fall   s major hurrican along our gulf coast region and in new orlean continu to have import consequ for our region   s economi   in the lake charl area of louisiana  which is the we nmost part of the state  recoveri is show the usual pattern that we   ve seen after other hurrican over the year   growth is now slight abov that of last year  employ led by construct is up about   percent over level a year ago   part of the mississippi coast are on a similar track   the big shipyard in pascagoula  mississippi  which suffer more than    billion in damag  is back in product and is now employ about        peopl  compar with        befor the storm   other part of the mississippi coast are recov more slowli becaus of a shortag of hous and the slow in get casino back on line  employ gain are depend on the game industri  but it look as though it will be late this year befor most of the casino will be abl to reopen  new orlean is still lag   the leve have been brought back to pre katrina status  but signific rebuild has not yet begun  and most peopl who left have not yet return   the area did add        job from the low point  but this number pale in comparison with the         job that were lost between april      and april        the area will continu to languish until the polit and regulatori issu surround rebuild are resolv and feder money begin to flow in signific amount next year  final  with respect to energi  repair to the damag gulf coast region drill platform  pipelin  and refineri has progress  and the shut in rate in may are now down to    percent for oil and about    percent for natur gas   with the big mar platform back fulli on line  these shut in figur should soon show addit improv  turn to the nation economi  gdp growth has clear slow  but it is also begin to exhibit increas volatil from quarter to quarter that is more characterist of what we saw in the     s rather than the uncharacterist steadi quarter to quarter pattern of the past sever year  the volatil make extract signal about the like growth path from recent data more difficult  as reflect in the wide error band around the near term growth project provid in the  book   my own forecast for growth in employ submit for this meet is slight more op ist than that in the  book but is well within the forecast error band  of greater concern to me  howev  is the inflat outlook   three issu relat to inflat are particular troublesom   first  core inflat has been outsid the rang that mani of us have public state we would prefer  and some of us have been express increas concern about the more recent data   some of the work my staff has done in attempt to decompos signal from nois in these number impli that much of the recent rise in the three month and six month cpi that has gotten so much attent is nois   but this implic in no way blunt the fact that even the signal compon of inflat has been on an upward trend for a while and that the trend show littl sign of abat  second  mani have note that the most recent jump in core cpi was driven by an increas in owner    equival rent   again  work my staff has done decompos the core cpi  look back at the period of veri low inflat as well as at the more recent period  clear impli that the recent increas in owner    equival rent should not have been a surpris becaus the number is driven by the fundament of demand for homeownership relat to rental demand   with interest rate so low dure the immedi post recess period  we es  that the prefer shift for new home relat to rental unit account for almost half of the     percent declin that occur in core cpi dure the novemb      to decemb      period   sinc then  with a rise in our polici interest rate  hous demand has slow  and demand for rental unit has increas with commensur increas in rent   the point is that this movement in core cpi price has a lot to do with our own polici shift   put the proper measur debat asid  this rais the difficult question of under what circumst we should respond to cyclic price movement that are themselv temporari respons to previous polici rate increas  my third and last concern relat to our abil  or perhap our willing  in the near term or the medium term to engin core inflat  howev measur  down to the   percent to   percent rang  and the risk that our continu adher to that much talk about  veri specif  and veri tight object without more explan of how we plan to take such a rang into account in our polici set may soon paint us into a difficult polici corner   but i   ll leav further thought on that to the polici discuss tomorrow   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   first vice presid stone
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the third district is also moder in the second quarter   our pattern is similar to that of the nation  but the district had less acceler in the first quarter and less deceler in the second quarter  payrol employ growth in our three state is slow   the unemploy rate has edg up slight over the past sever month  but the unemploy rate in most of the district   s labor market is still lower than a year ago   our busi contact still report some difficulti in fill open posit  and a quarter of the respond to a special question in our busi outlook survey of manufactur say that the increas in wage rate need to attract new hire this year are higher than they were last year  region manufactur activ continu to expand at a moder pace  but the index for new order and shipment were up notic after a one month slump in may   despit this improv  our manufactur    expect about futur activ have deterior   while they still plan to add to payrol and expand capac over the next six month  they have moder these plan sinc the begin of the year  at the last meet  i report that  in contrast to other district  retail in our region did not express much concern that higher gasolin price would eat into their sale  that view has chang   condit in our construct sector are similar to what i report at our last meet  nonresidenti construct continu to strengthen  but the acceler  sn   t appear to be as strong as elsewher in the nation   in contrast  residenti construct in our three state has been flat this year  and home sale are down   thus far the slow in our region look to be an order process  unfortun  consum price in the philadelphia region appear to be increas at a fa  pace than those in the nation as a whole  primarili becaus of a larger increas in hous cost in the philadelphia metropolitan area than in the nation   in addit  our manufactur report that industri price pressur have increas in recent month   fortun  we do not see a similar acceler in labor cost  although the increas we are see in the northeast are somewhat higher than in other part in the countri  in summari  current condit and the outlook in our region continu to be posit  but the rate of expans is expect to be somewhat more modest than we   ve seen over the past year  price pressur continu to be a concern in our region  turn to the nation front  i would character the outlook in a similar way   our growth forecast is similar to the  book   s for        we expect a signific slow in activ in the second quarter follow by a pickup dure the second half of the year to a pace that is slight below potenti   the slowdown in hous and high gasolin price contribut to a slowdown in consum spend  and the lag effect of rise short term interest rate and higher oil price keep real growth slight below potenti  our forecast for      differ somewhat from the  book   we see growth in      slight below that in       wherea the  book see growth slow appreci   in our view  there has been more under strength in the economi   for exampl  we attribut more of the second quarter slowdown to temporari factor   we are more op ist than the  book about employ growth   we see nonfarm payrol growth averag a good deal more than the  book forecast   we see unemploy rise to     percent by the fourth quarter of next year  our inflat outlook is less op ist than the  book   s part becaus we see less slow of aggreg demand   we do not see core pce inflat deceler next year   we think the economi has been oper and will continu to oper slight beyond full employ over the next sever quarter and that foreign price competit will eas as the dollar depreci   so despit our view that the indirect effect of the sharp rise in energi price will wane in       we expect core inflat not to deceler   we do see some deceler in       but that is becaus we built in a slight higher path for interest rate than that in the  book forecast  of cours  there are risk to the forecast   most of them have been mention  but in our view  the risk to growth  even at our higher level of growth  are rough balanc   in contrast  the inflat risk are slight to the upsid   as peopl have note  core inflat has acceler in recent month  and it is abov the rang i consid consist with price stabil   should aggreg demand moder less than expect  there is a risk that strong inflat pressur could emerg   at this point  i believ that longer run inflat expect remain anchor  and our forecast is predic on monetari polici ensur that the recent high inflat read do not rais longer term expect  this is like my last meet  but for sure i   ll be watch care as we go forward   i have confid that the committe  along with the new philadelphia presid  will do a good job to make sure that inflat expect remain anchor   i   d like to thank the chairman  the particip  and the rest of this staff for how well you have treat me over the past three meet  i have to rememb that i made the statement in june      that it would be my last meet  so i say    in the forese futur     laughter  it will be my last meet   thank you veri much
thank you veri much   let   s go to presid    and then perhap we can take a break
thank you  mr  chairman   the staff present make abund clear that most of the data we have receiv sinc we met in may have been disappoint in one way or anoth   recent econom activ appear to have been quit a bit weaker than expect  as exemplifi by the  book  which show a signific downward revis to   percent growth in the current quarter and a notic downward adjust to    percent in the second half of this year   howev  in view of the possibl that labor and product market may have move a bit beyond full util  as well as the recent high read on core inflat  a period of growth a bit below potenti could be seen as necessari to prevent a buildup of under inflationari pressur  under the assumpt of one more fund rate increas at this meet  it seem reason to me that growth will remain somewhat below it potenti rate  that the unemploy rate will gradual trend upward to slight abov the nairu by the end of next year  and that core inflat will gradual move down toward my comfort zone   if thing work out that way  i suppos the outcom would be near op   given that we are start from an undesir high inflat figur in the second quarter  my concern is that it is veri difficult at this stage to rule out a much less desir scenario in which the lag effect of our earlier reaction restrain activ more strong and more persist than we now expect   we might also see further financi disrupt as a consequ of investor    increas risk avers  which is the bearish possibl that dino describ earlier   in other word  the question is whether the larg surpris in the second quarter will be follow by a seri of similar surpris later this year   i am concern about downsid risk to the real outlook  especi until we can better gaug the magnitud of the repercuss from the weaken in hous market that now clear is under way  the data on core inflat in recent month present the opposit concern  have been higher than expect and push core inflat slight abov my comfort zone over the past year   this rais the possibl that we are make systemat error in our understand of the fundament forc drive inflat   the key question is whether the necessari declin in inflat requir more action from us or whether inflat is be push up by temporari factor that will dissip on their own   the  book  i think quit reason  show core inflat edg down over the next year and a half as the effect of sever temporari factor abat   one possibl in this regard is that there has been a modest pass through from energi price increas to core inflat and that these effect will dissip if energi price stabil at today   s elev level   moreov  part of the recent uptick trace to larg increas in hous cost that are final show up in the cpi just as the hous market is slow   as   note in his brief  the cpi measur of chang in hous price for owner occupi hous reflect movement in market rental rate rather than hous price and interest rate  after long be stagnant or even fall  rent are final move up   perhap with higher mortgag interest rate and lower expect of hous price appreci  specul properti are be dump into the market  and famili in the market for hous are now more inclin to rent rather than buy  drive rent up and hous price down   it certain would not be surpris to see a return to a more normal relationship between rent and hous price   such a phenomenon  if it is now play out  would most like be transitori rather than perman  although it could play out for quit some  e  unfortun  at this point it is difficult to tell how much of the recent rise in core inflat is temporari and how much is due to under inflat pressur like tight labor and product market  which would suggest a more persist problem for polici   i would feel more concern were it not for the larg reassur data on product  labor compens  and profit margin  that said  the good news is all in the forecast  wherea the bad news is in the data   so i certain can   t rule out the possibl that the increas in core inflat in the second quarter is the lead edg of a develop trend  in summari  i think the most like scenario is a relat benign one   howev  we have had some rather larg surpris in both output and inflat sinc we last met   it seem to me that  in the polici round come up  the more import matter are the risk that growth could slow much more than now seem like or that inflat could prove to be a more serious problem than i current expect it to be or  for that matter  that both factor could come into play   it is unlik that we will be abl to sharpen our assess of these risk veri much until more  e pass and more data becom avail
thank you   whi don   t we take a coffe break and be back at five after   thank you veri much   coffe break
new england   s economi remain in relat good shape  though not particular vibrant or reflect of great strength go forward   employ growth has been posit but slow in comparison to the nation   new england usual has a lower unemploy rate than the nation    but for the first  e in a decad or so the region   s unemploy rate has converg  most becaus the nation rate drop  but the region has flatten out over the past sever month   local measur of year over year inflat are about on track with the nation as well  though growth of local fuel and util cost is consider higher   mani busi peopl talk about their effort to limit their energi cost by upgrad capit equip and facil to be more energi effici and by look into altern sourc of energi   they also report mild success in pass along increas cost to consum   perhap reflect this  the rise price of gasolin  or even the consist raini weather over the past coupl of month  consum confid has sag a good deal  but not all the news is gloomi   busi sen ent  as suggest by survey and our meet with our small busi advisori group  remain posit overal as busi report solid growth and posit hire plan   mani continu to note how hard it is to find the skill labor they need   class a offic vacanc have declin in both downtown and suburban market  and rent are rise a bit   state tax collect  in particular sale and person incom tax  are exceed budget in everi state except rhode island  which appear to be experienc an extend  though as yet unexplain  soft spot   in general  i sens a good deal of op  among my busi contact about their own firm but uncertainti as well when they look at the evolut of both the region and the nation economi   inde  both the coincid region index done by the philadelphia fed and the lead index for massachusett that   s done by the univers of massachusett indic that the region economi is like to grow onli at a modest pace over the next year or so  buoy by a resurg in worldwid demand for high tech and biotech product but weigh down by subdu consum spend in the midst of high energi cost and declin in local hous market   i just want to reflect a bit on region residenti real estat market   here various data sourc   and there are lot of them   suggest that region market have slow  with sale fall in april and to a lesser degre in may  and unsold inventori continu to rise  with the number of month    suppli grow from about     in may of last year to more than    in may of this year   howev  price  depend on whether you look at median sale or repeat sale  either have fallen onli slight or have risen at about half the pace they had been rise   most analyst see this as a soft land or a period of stabil after sever year of strong price appreci   thus  while the local media and mani pundit  nation as well as local  wring their hand over the potenti for major real estat problem  at least up to now the market correct in new england appear to be proceed in a fair benign way   turn to the nation scene  incom data have serv to reinforc a sens of risk on both side of the  book forecast   as i note earlier  that forecast is not mark differ from our own  so when i talk about risk it will be the risk to our own forecast as well   to some degre  both slower growth and higher inflat were expect in the forecast that we   ve made over the past six month or so  but recent data may be exceed those expect   on the growth side  residenti construct has slow a bit more rapid than we thought   consum confid has fallen off   weaker equiti market  higher gas price  and somewhat lower hous price have like affect consum spend  and recent data on job growth have been slower  but there continu to be a good number of support to growth   household wealth remain high   growth abroad remain solid   financi condit outsid equiti market are accommod   busi remain high profit and cash rich as reflect in the mini boom in invest in nonresidenti structur  and product growth remain strong   inde  if one averag q  and q  expect growth  it   s a bit abov our earlier forecast  though clear one need to be mind of the fact that the first half start with a bang and it recent momentum has been consider cooler    this recent cool portend a fa  and steeper slowdown for the rest of       than reflect in the current  book forecast or our own   or could there be enough under strength to take us back to the growth scenario of our earlier project   in particular  i wonder a bit about the slow rate of job growth that is embed in the  book forecast for        i don   t know what the possibl is of some surpris on the upsid to the  book   s current       and  particular        project  but i think there may well be some   the incom data have been more disquiet on the price front   i   m not a person who believ that a given level of inflat is bad in and of itself  within reason of cours   i think it   s import to assess the level of inflat against everyth els go on in the economi   so at  e a level of   percent and chang might be fine  at other  e it might bear watch   and as far as i know  it   s been hard to prove that specif low level of inflat   let   s say  below   percent   are bad in and of themselv   but i do believ that a rapid increas or decreas in the rate of inflat growth can portend debilit chang in the economi   such increas or decreas need to be monitor care and figur import in the polici discuss   thus  i have view the six  and three month chang in core cpi and pce with some alarm as the rate of chang has been fa  than i am comfort with and certain fa  than our forecast expect   look at the first half of this year  and use the  book forecast for q   we see that core inflat is near    basi point higher than what we  in boston at least  had expect  our analysi suggest that most of the reason for this surg in inflat over the past coupl of year has been higher energi cost   bar untoward geopolit event  that should mean that inflat growth will moder   but given the small to nonexist output gap we see current reflect in the low unemploy rate  there is more than a minor risk that resourc pressur could begin to play a role in inflationari growth   the  book forecast suggest that slower growth will provid a moder influenc on inflat   that   s our best bet as well  but prudent risk manag might suggest some hedg of that bet   thank you
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   let me outlin a few comment from my busi contact first   wal mart   and   talk about that a bit   has a substanti piec of it busi  but by no mean all of it  with lower incom consum   they are come in sever hundr basi point below plan sinc ea   and that   s for the entir busi   that   s a pretti substanti hit for the world   s largest retail   of cours  that   s most u s  busi  there is a pronounc paycheck cycl   an exampl that my contact gave me was that right after receiv paycheck  which general come at the end of the month and the middl of the month  consum are buy larg economi size packag of stuff that come that way   as they go through the month  up to the next paycheck  they are buy increas smaller quantiti  they   re just run out of liquid until the next paycheck come   wal mart still has mani applic for everi job   on averag  when they are expand  they have ten applic for everi job  my contact at j b  hunt said that he had the general percept that the economi is slow   hunt and  i think  mani other truck compani have not been expand their fleet   in fact  hunt has cut back it truck fleet becaus of the shortag of driver   my contact said that there   s a dire   that was his word   shortag of driver  the shortag is wors than he has ever seen it   but   and i think this is interest   hunt is not respond with wage increas beyond the normal   to   percent a year   i talk to my contact about that  and he said they are just not readi to rais wage   what they do is to manag their busi by tell peopl that    the truck capac is not avail  go someplac els      some of that is tri to push custom into higher cost deliveri at hunt  and the custom may go that way or may just go someplac els   the  book discuss the larg truck issu with the new truck engin requir  that   s go to produc a veri larg cycl in larg truck   i guess that the compani produc those larg truck and engin are fulli occupi this year  and then there   s go to be a slack period  my fedex contact said that he   not see weak in ani part of the busi except domest express   what   s happen there is that  becaus of the high fuel surcharg and the improv ground servic  quit a number of custom are shift from express air  which is much more expens  to ground   he said that they do have some pressur regard it and account profession   salari in those area are rise perhap    percent abov last year  my up contact talk most about a tentat agreement with it pilot union    this is not yet public inform  i think it will be releas later this week    the characterist of the agreement are quit interest   i may not have all the detail quit correct  but one of the thing that astonish me is that the agreement  if ratifi by the membership  run to              a labor contract that extend to         there   s an upfront      percent pay increas  but it reflect the fact that there have been no increas sinc the previous contact expir in       so there   s a makeup there   but the percentag increas thereaft to me are quit low  and it   s interest that they were abl to get the pilot to sign on   after eighteen month    percent  and then everi twelv month thereaft                           that may not all add up to       but i was write as fast as i could   but that   s the general pattern       to     percent stretch out over come year   they bargain hard  and up was abl to have a contract with no cost of live adjust in it  which i think is signific in term of inflat expect   there were some other allow have to do with work rule  some per diem allow  pension  and so forth   so the total cost are a bit higher than the           percent would indic  but that is the basic pattern   there is also a sign bonus when the contract is ratifi   a captain will get         for sign on the dot line that ratifi the contract  a first offic will get          and a second offic will get           those bonus  i believ  will not show up in the eci  given the way the eci is put togeth   so i think we want to keep our eye out for wage agreement that have thing in them that escap the eci   i expect fedex to follow pretti quick  now i want to make a coupl of general comment   the  book certain has a pretti strong busi capit spend project   my view is that  in recent year  compani have had rather contain or constrain capit expenditur  and firm work hard to be disciplin in cost control to make sure they didn   t expand capac until they realli need it  of cours  corpor profit have done veri well   but now mani compani have veri littl excess capac  and they are put in place more capac   my fedex contact said that fedex is increas it capit expenditur this year  and    percent of the spend is for capac expans   in recent year  a much larger fraction was for product improv rather than capac expans   so i think that this expans of capac reflect busi op  about the long run   most of these plan have a veri long period connect with them   even though some of the expans involv item  like comput  that are purchas off the shelf  these item are part of a much longer term plan   i don   t think this part of the economi is vulner to a quick turnaround   the slower growth in consumpt like reflect the pressur on lower incom consum  and we have limit spend capac  perhap for mani consum  becaus the save rate is alreadi so low   so mayb what we   re see is the long await and long desir shift in the composit of gdp toward more busi invest and less consumpt  and that chang in mix would be veri healthi   yet to come would be ani evid of a chang toward higher net export  but this would be a chang in composit with less consumpt  less hous  and more busi invest   there   s been a lot of discuss about energi pass through   i   m go to make an assert that   s probabl a littl too bold  but i think it   s basic correct   if energi price stay where they are  in the long run full pass through must occur   compani can   t absorb energi cost forev   full pass through must occur  and the pass through occur in sever way   one way  as with the up and fedex surcharg  is that they just put those into the busi   they just are not go to absorb those   other type of pass through occur through compani    substitut energi save technolog   for exampl  to reduc energi intens   but such technolog don   t come free   so they   re go to have to includ the cost of those substitut in what they do   then we can have chang in the mix of good that are produc and consum  such as the chang in the mix away from express air toward ground servic   but the energi pass through has to be complet in the long run   if we   re go to avoid a long run effect on the price level  higher energi price must be offset by lower price elsewher  so that this becom a chang in relat price without an effect on the aggreg price level   i just want to make that comment becaus it look to me as though we   re in a situat in which oil is expect to remain around     a barrel for an indefinit futur and those adjust are go to be take place continu   so we ought to work under the assumpt that there   s go to be complet pass through
thank you   vice chairman     sorri  point of intervent
bill  this isn   t the way peopl have been use    pass through    around here   i   ve taken    pass through    to mean an increas in the overal core rate  and i think that   s the way everyon els has use it   so the scenario you describ wouldn   t result in ani pass through  the way for exampl presid   use the term   am i right
part of what we   ve been do is look at individu case   until recent  for exampl  the passeng airlin were unabl to pass through fuel increas  wherea the ups and fedex of the world were abl to pass them through   but eventu  the passeng airlin have to pass through becaus they   re unprofit if they don   t   the price increas have to pass through
i understand that  bill
we   ve been use the term as a way of understand some of the under price power that firm have   firm do absorb cost increas in the short run  but they can   t absorb them in the long run   so what has to happen is that the secondari effect will show up in the level of core unless we put downward pressur on the non energi relat part  so that this end up be a relat price chang and not a chang in the aggreg price level  that   s the point i   m tri to make
thank you  mr  chairman   i guess i   d say the center of graviti of this discuss is a littl stronger than the  book  and i think that   s pretti much where we are  too   we expect real gdp growth to follow a path pretti close to potenti in the balanc of       and in        and we expect core pce inflat to moder gradual to around   percent in         this forecast assum a monetari polici path close to that of the  book  somewhat under the market   s forecast   sinc may  in our view  the balanc of risk has shift a bit toward the less favor mix of somewhat more downsid risk to real growth and somewhat more upsid risk to inflat   relat to the  book  howev  this impli that we have a stronger trajectori for demand growth and a slight lower path for inflat  on the growth side  i guess i   d say we see a pretti healthi adjust process under way with a chang in the composit of growth   we don   t see the incom data  the anecdot  and the recent develop in financi market as support the view that real growth is like to stay signific below potenti over the full forecast period   we had alreadi anticip the slowdown in residenti invest that has now materi  therefor  we didn   t see that as a basi for revis down our forecast   we believ the chang in household wealth in general have less effect on consumpt than the board staff believ  and as a result we expect a more modest deceler in growth   we expect stronger employ growth  too  and we have a stronger view of the rate of growth in privat invest go forward   the world economi still look pretti robust to us   so overal  in our view  this support a forecast for the economi to be grow at a rate a bit abov   percent over the next year and a half  but the risk to this forecast of growth seem a littl less balanc than they did in may  we see less chanc that the expans is go to reacceler to a pace signific abov potenti  and we see a bit more chanc for a weaker outcom   the princip sourc of downsid risk to us remain the possibl that household are go to reduc consumpt growth signific becaus they feel less rich  less secur  less comfort borrow  and less certain about the futur  on the inflat outlook  we have move up our expect trajectori for core pce price inflat  but we still expect this measur to moder  as i said  to around   percent by the end of         this forecast is pretti favor   it rest on the familiar fundament forc of energi price  if they follow the futur curv  becom a sourc of moder to price pressur go forward   strong product growth keep unit labor cost from acceler sharpli   profit margin adjust to absorb ani increas in unit labor cost that might come if labor   s share start to move back toward it histor averag   growth of aggreg demand moder to potenti   it probabl has alreadi moder to potenti   which attenu the risk of further upsid pressur on resourc util go forward   most import  long term inflat expect have come down a bit   they remain in the rang of the past few year  and they have proven respons to chang in polici expect in a more reassur way than we saw veri recent  as in may  howev  we believ the risk to this forecast are still somewhat to the upsid becaus of the follow   headlin inflat and near term inflat expect have been run substanti abov core for some  e   virtual all the way we tri to captur under inflat have been run abov core   the recent rise in core may impli more momentum in inflat dynam   you might say that long term inflat expect are a littl higher than we want over  e  and they may have been too respons to chang in the incom data   the medium term trajectori for the dollar seem like to be down   profit margin  for reason we don   t fulli understand  have been veri high and have been rise  and mayb that tell us someth about inflat psycholog that we don   t see in the long term breakeven and tip   the long term forecast of inflat that the staff present give us show a lot of persist of inflat   inflat fall veri  veri slowli over  e  and if that path is right  it could caus some further damag to inflat psycholog   if you just step back and look at how much our expect and the market    expect about the termin rate  the fund rate at which we   d stop tighten  have chang over the past two year  it   s realli remark   the expect eighteen month ago were about     basi point below where we are now   that chang may impli that we will learn in retrospect that we were too loos for too long  and therefor we   ll have to do more than we thought to counteract that effect on inflat   that   s a possibl  not a predict   so as i said in the begin  in some sens the balanc of risk has shift in a way that complic the monetari polici choic for us  and the shift leav us with less confid about the appropri path for polici go forward   on balanc  monetari polici appear to be get some traction in the unit state  and the expans still look to be in good shape   inflat risk seem a bit tilt to the upsid  and monetari polici need to continu to be direct at ensur signific moder in the trajectori of inflat over the next few year   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   incom data have tend to confirm to a degre both the downsid risk to growth and the upsid risk to core inflat that we   ve been talk about at recent meet   higher inflat interact with policymak comment on the inflat situat trigger higher expect real interest rate and more uncertainti about the longer term futur   that in turn further tighten financi condit  lead to more markdown of growth prospect   notabl  the worri about ad inflat pressur has not been confin to the unit state  given strong growth abroad  high energi and commod price  and a sens that output is close to potenti   widespread polici tighten and greater uncertainti have led to increas caution on the part of investor and tighter global financi condit  the incom data certain have influenc my project   i expect less growth and more inflat than i did a few month ago   i   m also even less confid  if that   s possibl  than i was given these surpris   the key question in my mind is whether the condit are in place or soon will be in place   that is  after tomorrow   to keep core inflat at consider lower level than it has been so far this year   i think they are  and in this regard i   m a touch more op ist than the staff   i have slight lower inflat for      with the same polici assumpt  most import  i don   t believ that the extra inflat we   ve had result from the economi produc beyond it long run potenti   we obvious can   t be veri confid about this   the declin in the unemploy rate to notic below   percent occur onli at the begin of this year  but the behavior of compens last year and this year suggest to me that the nairu is more like to be under than to be over   percent   perhap better job match through internet search  declin real minimum wage  and linger worker insecur  after the onli moder increas in employ earli in this expans  have lower the nairu a touch   we should expect compens growth to pick up as in the staff forecast  but the implic of this pickup for inflat are unclear  given elev profit margin and what is like to be a competit busi environ   i do think relat price adjust are play an import role in what we   ve been see   i suspect i have been implicit underes  the effect of higher energi price on both output and inflat   befor this year  the effect of rise energi price on inflat was offset by slack in the economi  and the effect on activ was offset by eas monetari polici that was put in place to counter that slack   with both slack and eas polici disappear  the effect of higher energi price are show through in both output and inflat  anoth advers price shock seem to be come from the hous market  where the previous run up in price and the higher interest rate are weaken prospect for home price appreci   this weaken  in turn  is both reduc activ and rais actual and imput owner    equival rent   the longer term inflat effect of both these relat price chang will depend on their persist and their propag into other price   in this regard  presid pool  i see us as perhap accommod the first round effect of the increas in price but make sure they don   t propag beyond that  rather than have a price level target that would bring us back down to the old price level   with regard to persist  petroleum price have level out sinc april  and futur market don   t suggest further increas   it   s difficult to get much of a fix on futur rent increas  as price and rent realign to higher interest rate and lower expect capit gain   in the past  most of that realign has come through price  but we don   t have mani observ  and the requir adjust appear much larger this  e   there are two key to prevent the relat price chang from becom embed in broader and more persist inflat   low inflat expect and a competit busi environ   if energi price do flatten out  headlin inflat will come down  and i think that will help to contain the inflat expect of household and busi and bring down core inflat   the propag of higher rate of increas in rent  should they persist  to other price i found much harder to analyz   after all  homeown are  in effect  pay themselv higher imput price  and it   s not clear that they would chang their behavior in labor market to expect higher wage as a result   moreov  with respect to owner    equival rent  i think our usual financi market measur of inflat expect may not be reliabl indic of behavior shift   expect persist increas in owner    equival rent will boost expect cpi show up in tip spread but not necessarili affect other price decis   a persist of elev rent increas will put a premium on view their implic for futur inflat rather than on simpli react to the incom data   the competit environ will depend larg on the degre of resourc util  in this regard  the negat effect of the oil and hous market develop on activ  along with the tighten in financi condit  suggest that activ could well run at least a littl below the rate of growth of potenti for the next sever quarter   that will help to limit longer run inflat pressur   in a sens  the forc that seem to be push up inflat are also contribut to the condit that should hold it in check   in sum  recent inflat data have been an unpleas surpris  but the sourc of the price increas   that is  price shock  not overshoot   and the econom condit come into place should impli a soften of core inflat over the next     year   this outcom is base on the assumpt that the relat price increas don   t becom more broad embed in other price and second round effect   we   ll talk tomorrow about how polici might contribut to reduc the odd of that possibl   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i continu in my concern  which i express at the last meet  about the recent pickup in inflat  especi given the news that we   ve had sinc the last meet   in the past three month  core cpi price and core pce price have grown  respect  at     percent and     percent  twice their rate of growth in the previous three month    it has been interest to listen to and read the analys that mani folk are do  tri to pars the reason for the jump in the inflat rate  no matter what index peopl are follow  the question  as sever of you have mention  is realli whether the reason is persist inflat or whether it   s one off kind of chang   we   ve alreadi had sever thought about how to look at the relat of energi price increas and their persist to the rate of inflat  i won   t add ani more to what has alreadi been said  but i thought mr    had a good discuss of the owner    equival rent problem   what are we realli look at here   some of the possibl i found amus   one of them  for exampl  point out that the index use to look at the cost of bank servic was up signific becaus the opportun cost on demand deposit had gone up   if that   s the problem  we can cure it by just stop the rais of rate   laughter   so i do think we need to realli focus on where we are   without be abl to realli understand the under framework here  i am veri concern about the trend  when i look at the dramat drop in forecast growth  at first i becam veri pessimist about the outlook  as sever of you have also comment   but the more i look at the number  the more i came to realiz that the reduct is all come from residenti hous construct   everyth els is basic a push from the last forecast for this year and next year   when i look at the forecast with that perspect  i see thing differ   i   ve been concern about the amount of specul in hous construct throughout the countri   to the extent that what   s come out of the hous sector is this excess specul  that   s healthi both for the long run economi and for the stabil of the financi system   one of our challeng in look at some of the recent indic is to determin whether we will realli have a soft transit to more sustain long term growth of new hous or whether the transit will be bumpier or perhap more abrupt   a chart in the  book that got my attent was how rapid the cancel of sale order for new hous had jump within the past five month  from it long run trend of    percent sinc       to a high rate of    percent   some of these sale data or permit data that we   re see today may mean more addit to excess inventori  and so we may see more of a blip  that   s someth i think we need to watch   i think we can   t be complac that a nice eas into long term sustain growth of hous is a sure thing at this point  at the same  e  becaus the drop in the forecast is all hous  the question is how to look at the relat growth of the rest of the economi   sinc on net it   s basic move the way it was  i said to myself that i was comfort with that   but whi am i uncomfort go forward   i  too  hear anecdot about compani    op  about what they can do in term of increas revenu and profit  regard the capac issu  we need to realiz that a lot of the resourc in hous construct are not necessarili transfer to other sector  except perhap to commerci real estat   that sector is forecast to pick up  and so some of the growth could happen there   but the inabl to transfer resourc still rais issu  in term of both fix invest and peopl  and i don   t believ that the appar slowdown to below trend  sinc it is driven by hous construct  is realli go to creat much excess capac   so that situat make me concern about inflat   final  i   d like to talk about how hous affect liquid and monetari polici and our accommod   sever of you and the staff said earlier that we have seen a bit of adjust in debt spread sinc the last meet   and volatil is up   but we all agre that spread are still veri narrow by histor standard   focus on the staff   s forecast of the flow of fund for the next two year  i found an interest thing if you look at what   s happen when hous drop to the level forecast in the  book   household  in borrow for mortgag  basic have been the major user of net borrow in the past coupl of year   the forecast is for household    need for fund  the net borrow  to drop one third between      and        the amount by which net household borrow drop is more than the borrow by all other sector combin last year   so part of the issu is that  becaus household are such a power engin in net borrow  there will be plenti of fund avail   also  as to the extent that bank borrow and fund provis are forecast to drop  the banker i talk with said that they aren   t go to let the amount of loan that they extend drop as much as i think is in that forecast   so i realli believ that the drop in hous is actual on net go to make liquid avail for other sector rather than be a drain go forward and that will also get the growth rate more posit than the current  book forecast
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   in term of my overal comment  i consid my view realli in the center of graviti  as the vice chairman describ it  of the speaker around the tabl and probabl  again  quit a bit more op ist in term of gdp growth and perhap also more concern about inflat risk than the  book  when i look at the strength of the fundament of the economi  includ strong and acceler profit  low unemploy  high access capit market  and remark strong balanc sheet both for consum and busi  i find it hard to reconcil those with some of the pessim come not just from the  book but also from some economist that the market follow   the two trend and the two set of data seem to be go in veri differ direct  regard the data that have come in sinc our last fomc meet  some  e has been spent here on a few of the negat surpris  so i want to highlight a few of the posit bit of news   feder tax receipt in may were up    percent from may a year ago   for the past twelv month  as we   ve talk about befor  total tax receipt into the govern went up      percent   core retail sale rose     percent in may  up about     percent year over year if we exclud some of the more volatil item   accord to survey and anecdot  the manufactur base continu to be remark robust  both in term of growth and in term of job   i   d also note that durabl good order  though not incred robust over the past month  repres growth of about    percent over the past three month if we exclud aircraft and look onli at nondefens capit good   so all in all  i think that the data suggest a more posit trend  what i   d like to do is spend a littl  e talk about how the market have react to this news and build on a coupl of the point that dino made at the outset   first  a lot of pundit have describ the    new volatil    in the marketplac  and i think that dino made a veri compel case that the volatil has realli not been near as sever as the comment suggest   volatil has in some way been a euphem for the fact that the market have been down  and those are obvious quit differ thing    laughter   i think anoth bit of convent wisdom is influenc decisionmak  both in washington and in busi  and it is probabl import to correct   that idea is that somehow the fed has been the caus of this market volatil   i think that is larg incorrect   when i look at what has happen  i think that the market are focus more and more on core econom fundament   we have chang in the perspect of the market  which use to think some month and quarter ago that bad news meant good news and now they think that bad news is actual bad news   the bad news previous meant that we weren   t go to be move rate higher   again  i think the market  not the comment  have a better understand that they realli need to be focus on econom fundament  when i look at the econom fundament  one of the data point that i look to is the state of corpor profit growth at this point in the cycl   over the past twelv month  it was      percent  and if we look at bottom up analyst forward es  for the s p     or for the russel  it appear that those analyst es  are actual acceler   as a former banker  i will admit to some bias in these number  but they   ve been track reason well   the forward es  are that corpor profit should be up someth like    percent   so one of the thing that we can do over the next sever meet is see how actual result track against those expect  and my bet is that there will not be as much disappoint in those number as the top down macroeconom view would suggest  dive down into some of the individu market  i suggest that they   re tell us differ thing about the state of the economi and the state of inflat prospect   first  the equiti market have been off on the order of   or   percent  and mani peopl  myself includ  would have thought that that would have signific affect ceo confid  that it would have chang some perspect about where they are in the capit expenditur cycl   i think that probabl has happen in the ipo market   the ipo market has gotten slower and more select  and issu that can come to market now have been at the top end of what   s in the pipelin   if we look more broad  howev  beyond what   s go on in the equiti market  if we look at the cap ex market  capit expenditur appear to be abov plan general from the discuss i   ve had with folk who are on board of differ compani  one ceo call befor come out with a survey of ceo expect for growth in capit expenditur  and he exclaim     what are you guy see that we   re not      in some way he was check to tri to understand what the reason was for concern when his compani survey continu to be quit posit   the onli caution i have is that  if you look across a breadth of ceo survey on growth  the survey number have  in fact  come down from  let   s say  april to june   but  again  my sens of the matter is that ceo are scratch their own head at this veri moment that we   re have a discuss about the economi in transit   the messag that come from the fed and from other policymak over the next month  includ in the chairman   s monetari polici tes oni  will be veri import to set the tone  becaus ceo are not sure whether to continu to hit the acceler or whether this might be a  e in their own busi for a paus in capit expenditur   i have a few comment on a coupl of other market   normal in a  e like this  when the equiti market are off       or   percent  the merger and acquisit market  which i view as a pretti good proxi for ceo confid  would stop   in fact  that hasn   t happen   m a pipelin are more robust than ever   the unthink deal are be print and be publish   pipelin are terrif strong  and ceo are readi in some way to    bet the compani    on the strength of their convict   anoth reason that i have confid that busi growth could well be in excess of the  book es    let me make two or three other comment   first  in term of inflat  as i look at the commod market and at the tip market  i   m most comfort not so much by relat move  becaus those tip market are certain not perfect in describ inflat expect  but by the respons of those market to remark that have come from folk around this tabl   that is  if we think about what our author is in influenc inflat expect  the veri real  e chang in the tip market give me comfort that at this point in the cycl we will be abl  with proper and appropri polici that we   ll discuss tomorrow  to chang those inflat expect rather dramat   so i think that   s a reason comfort idea   final  the fix incom market and high yield market certain have move higher in term of spread but  again  not a lot by histor perspect   under normal market condit or more pessimist market condit than we have now  that move  even a small relat move  would have slow down those pipelin   instead  liquid is plenti   a coupl of anecdot that we heard befor describ the situat      or    basi point in the high yield market are not chang activ   they   re not chang the interest of invest bank and issuer in come to market as quick as they can   so in term of market function  apart from price  those market are work except well  what would be a reason for pessim  and what would be a reason to think that the volatil that has been discuss over the past sever week might turn into real volatil   one thing that i look to with some degre of concern is the price that are be paid and the leverag that   s be put on compani that could chang the liquid in those market veri quick   i wouldn   t be surpris to find   over the forecast period for sure and mayb even over        a    club    deal in which mani privat equiti partner group togeth in a high leverag situat to buy a veri larg public compani and take it privat and  after the cours of due dilig and of that acquisit  the deal close and they find that they miss the first coupon   that is  the leverag that is be put on these compani  for all the reason we have discuss around this tabl  is relat remark   those leverag ratio use to sound like purchas price  and they   re expect meaning cost save that can come out of these busi six and nine month out   i suppos i   m concern that  as these deal come togeth  there might be a negat surpris that affect the compani so that the first coupon would be imposs or difficult to meet   in that circumst  all the op  that i   ve describ in term of these debt market could dissip rather mark   so i don   t want to suggest a degre of op  that isn   t born out by the fact   that   s someth we need to continu to stay attun to   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   at the last meet i believ dave    when he was describ the outlook  said that he was a bit schizophren about it  given the comment of presid    it is clear that he is no longer schizophren but that one side has taken over   the dark side    laughter    that   not seem to reflect exact where everyon is  but i think the issu that have been brought out in the  book are extrem import to consid   i  too  have knock down my growth es  a bit  although not quit as much as the  book  and i  too  as mani peopl have said  share a concern that some of the number come in on both headlin and core inflat are a bit higher than i had hope  although i think they are still not out of a manag rang  obvious  payrol employ growth is a bit less robust than in the previous forecast  sinc that forecast  we   ve had a littl more cool in hous and some soften of retail demand   i take a slight differ view of the high tax receipt that have been pour into the treasuri becaus they are not onli corpor tax receipt but also individu tax receipt   in some sens that   s put a bit of a drag on real dispos incom becaus peopl seem to be pay a littl more in tax and  at the same  e  labor cost and pay have not been go up  so tax are potenti a bit of a drag  and the administr seem abl to pursu a tighter expenditur polici this year than it has in the past  so we won   t be get as much of a boost on the fiscal side as we have had  a number of bright spot have been mention here  particular relat to busi fix invest  durabl good order  and busi confid   but what are some of the key risk that we have befor us   obvious  hous has been discuss in great detail  and so i won   t go through it in more detail   i note  as governor bie did  the import of cancel in suggest a chang in the way peopl are deal with these market   if cancel go up signific  then a lot more hous stock that is search for a buyer could be left on the market   anecdot  i   ve heard the same kind of thing that presid guynn mention  that the equival of the toa  is perhap be given out   such incent are not show up in the report hous price  but other adjust are   i   m not quit as op ist about world econom growth as the forecast is   i think a lot of uncertainti exist there   we have seen and are see a lot of elect  particular in emerg market   mexico obvious has one come up veri soon  which could have a signific effect on a veri import trade partner of the unit state   also  as a number of peopl have mention  we   re see a lot of polici tighten around the world   the obvious question is whether the central bank outsid the unit state are behind the curv or ahead of the curv   well  wherev they are  they are move along a curv  and they seem to be move more aggress than they have in the past   i think the tighten is go to have more of an effect than has been embed in a number of the forecast  not onli here but also at the imf  anoth concern that i have relat to someth that presid pianalto mention   a disconnect between the number that we   re see on consumpt and busi op  about invest   my concern is about what   s go to be happen to demand for their product down the line   it   s certain disconcert to hear that one of the largest privat institut in the world   wal mart   is miss it growth target fair signific   they are a veri import part of retail sale   one could even say that they effect know what retail sale are befor the number are report becaus their sale are so high correl with overal retail sale   so my concern is that we   re have the economi do the right sort of thing by move more toward busi invest and a littl away from consumpt  but if we move too much away from consumpt  the demand won   t be there to make the invest pay off   we saw a bit of this in the late     s as we move much more in the invest direct  but the invest turn out not to have the kind of return that peopl were expect   now we   re in a veri fortun situat becaus  even if those return declin dramat  a lot of profit is out there  as governor   said   so profit could drop quit signific  but we   re not go to see a real problem in the corpor sector  as we might have in other circumst   i don   t want to overemphas this concern  but to me it   s a bit of a puzzl  and i see it definit as a risk   turn to the inflat outlook  peopl have mention both here and public a cavalcad of concern about the uptick in pce and cpi core number  which have help in turn to reduc inflat expect   term premium continu to remain low  and forward rate continu to remain low   often inflat seem to have a bit of momentum   it continu to move up or stay elev   even as the economi begin to slow a bit   we have to be care in deciph what will continu to move up and what is just inflat that is lag a bit as the economi slow   we have seen a dramat chang in commod price sinc our last meet  basic  within a few day of the meet on may     almost all the major commod  whether copper  gold  or whichev one you want  came to a peak   sinc then  oil has come down a littl  although not all that much   i think it   s hearten for the inflat outlook go forward that those elev level didn   t stay that elev   although those commod price are much higher in      than they had been previous  oil price have not increas that much dure        so what   s go to happen to core inflat go forward   i think the excel present that we had  in particular the discuss of the attempt to see how well we are model histor inflat and inflat go forward  show that we have a long way to go and that we don   t realli understand those dynam veri well   i share governor kohn   s intuit  for the reason that he articul  that core inflat go forward will soften a bit more than the  book project   i   m not go to repeat those reason  but as governor kohn said  there   s a lot of uncertainti about them  and we don   t understand all that much  ul   as a number of peopl have mention  it come down a lot to the type of statement that we make  the credibl that we have   that   s true not onli here but around the world  where we are see inflat rate and expect inflat rate come down quit a bit  that   s someth that ul  we control veri direct   in today   s circumst  when inflat is not realli out of control but is move up a littl  be veri clear about what our concern are can have benefit in bring down expect and perhap chang the inflat dynam   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   if i could tri your patienc for a few more minut at the end of a long afternoon  i   d like to summar what i   ve heard today and then just add a few comment of my own   while i   m do that     would you distribut tabl     tabl   in the bluebook show the three altern suggest for the statement   sinc the bluebook  we have receiv some suggest  and we   ve done some wordsmith   we   ve actual respond to a few thing we heard today   the general tone of the three statement is the same  but we want you to see where it was today  so that you could think about it overnight and so that it would help you for your discuss tomorrow   that   s go to be come around   let me just briefli summar what i heard   certain  a central theme of the speaker today was the increas of uncertainti and risk in the environ   it   s get more and more difficult to forecast  and there are certain risk both to the upsid and to the downsid   the central tendenc with respect to output seem to be that output is slow to someth close to potenti   some felt growth would be stronger than the  book suggest  other  like the  book  thought it would be fall somewhat below potenti   a few peopl saw downsid risk from previous tighten   there was some disagr on the extent to which financi condit are support of the economi  and some disagr on consumpt  although there was a view that lower incom consum were go to do wors than higher incom consum   hous is certain slow   some took the view that it was slow more or less as expect  wherea some thought the slow was somewhat wors than expect   certain that   s a sourc of downsid risk   the view of the labor market is that it remain reason healthi  that it   s difficult to find skill worker  but there are still few sign of wage pressur in the economi   the busi sector evalu were much more upbeat  with ongo expans  good sen ent  and capit invest   final  there seem to be consider uneas about recent inflat develop   everyon consid these recent develop to be unwelcom   some felt that the recent increas in inflat might be temporari   other saw it as more persist   but there certain was a sens that it   s a risk to the economi   let me add just a few thought about the situat   the situat is  i think  except complic becaus at least three differ thing are go on   first of all  there   s a cyclic transit from a period of abov trend growth to what we would hope would be a period of trend growth  the normal soft land problem   second  we essenti have a suppli shock   it   s not exact a suppli shock becaus it has complic element to it  but oil price and commod price are rise signific  and that is creat a worsen tradeoff   third  we are have a hous cycl that has a certain autonom compon to it becaus it   s like ani other asset price correct take place on it own schedul  so to speak  and it is interact with the other two forc   so given these three thing occur at the same  e  the situat is obvious veri complic  now  the ideal situat would be for us to move to a steadi  sustain pace without inflat   right now  the biggest risk to that steadi pace seem to be the pickup that we   ve seen recent in inflat   the main point i want to make about inflat   mani point have alreadi been made   is that it realli is quit broad base  i think there are good reason to downweight  to some extent  owner    equival rent   it is arguabl a cost of live  howev  the effect of monetari polici on this kind of cost of live are somewhat ambigu   so we could get ourselv into a bad situat if we focus on it too much   but have said that  if you slice  say  core pce in ani other way   if you look  for exampl  at core pce price exclud oer  at core good  at core pce servic exclud oer  at market base core pce less oer  at ani of these way of slice inflat   you get a similar pattern in term of the three month  six month  and twelv month averag  which suggest a broad base acceler and one that i think we should be concern about   we should also note that the three month total pce inflat rate is      which is signific becaus it influenc inflat expect overal  now  a concern that we all have   and mani peopl express   is that we don   t fulli understand whi this sudden acceler is take place   some of the possibl are  first  the suppli shock increas of energi price  second  the tight product market  and third  chang in inflat psycholog  perhap relat to headlin inflat   i guess i would just rais the possibl that these three thing are interact   perhap with tighter product market it   s easier to pass through your energi cost or your commod cost   that pass through interact with higher inflat psycholog  and there   s mayb a vicious cycl there   the thing we should be concern about is whether those higher price then lead to higher wage pressur in an invers kind of spiral   so i do have concern about inflat  although i don   t want to exagger   i think we   re still look at number that are histor not extrem high   the other big issu is the hous cycl   i   m go to give us a bit of perspect   it is a good thing that hous is cool   if we could wave a magic wand and reinstat       we wouldn   t want to do that becaus the market has to come back to equilibrium   the level of activ now is about a third bigger than it was in dure the boom in the late     s   the hous construct industri is larg  bigger than histor normal  and a control declin in hous obvious is help to us at this stage in bring us to a soft land in the economi  but as peopl have point out  the cool is an asset price correct   like ani other asset price correct  it   s veri hard to forecast  and consequ it is an import risk and one that should lead us to be cautious in our polici decis  as we   ll talk about tomorrow  anoth potenti nonlinear is in financi market  as we   ve seen recent   we don   t have a good understand of how chang in interest rate are affect risk reduct and posit in financi market right now   just a bit of commentari on consumpt   a lot of our uncertainti   i guess you   d call it model uncertainti   is the question about how a declin in hous price will affect consum spend   the rang of view is wide  some argu that  becaus of equiti withdraw and so on  the effect would be veri larg   i don   t know the answer to that question  obvious  but i think there are some posit factor that will support consumpt go forward   to name a few  the job market remain good  unemploy insur claim are low  unemploy is low  and i suspect that wage and incom will start to rise some  soon   consum confid is not that bad   gasolin price are like to come down   in part  they are reflect high ethanol price  which will come down over  e   we   ve seen befor that consum confid can be veri sensit to gasolin price   balanc sheet remain reason healthi  even if hous price flatten out  peopl have accumul a lot of equiti  and the implic of that is that they can smooth their consumpt through rough  e  if necessari  by draw on that equiti   final  kevin and randi  i think  gave differ side of the surg in tax collect  but on the whole it is probabl a posit sign   it probabl suggest there is more econom activ than we are captur   so let me just conclud by reiter that we find ourselv in an extraordinarili complic situat becaus we have these differ theme   the cyclic turn point  the suppli shock  and the hous cycl   the implic is that  whatev we do  we   re go to have to be veri deliber and care  but i think we cannot ignor the inflat side of this equat  ani other comment   well  thank you again for your patienc in a long afternoon   i   m glad this is a two day meet    laughter   everyon should have tabl    i don   t expect signific chang befor tomorrow   i   ll see you tonight at the british embassi  and we will reconven tomorrow morn at        meet recess  june               of     june            morn session
good morn  everyon   mr  reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   as can be seen in the top panel of your first exhibit  market particip mark up their expect of polici action at this and subsequ fomc meet  on net  over the intermeet period  appar  the upward impetus of stronger than anticip releas on inflat and statement by feder reserv offici more than offset the drag of read on econom activ that had a soft cast   the expect path for the feder fund rate over the next two year  the middl left panel  had shift    to    basi point by the  e of the public of the bluebook   in the week sinc  those expect edg higher still  with investor sure of a   point hike today and expect more of the same by autumn   as has been true for a while  the fund rate is appar seen by investor as trail off subsequ   with your last   point rise roll off in        three explan have been offer for this invers of the money market futur curv  as note in the middl right panel   the first  which is probabl more popular insid this build than outsid it  is that it may well be op  to rais the nomin fund rate in respons to a temporari bulg in inflat so as to keep the real interest rate from fall   as inflat reced  the nomin fund rate can be reduc so as to prevent the real fund rate from rise   such a path has been a common featur of the bluebook exercis we   ve shown you when the committe is assum to desir an inflat goal below the prevail rate of inflat   the second explan is base on an assum nonlinear in the hous market   hous demand  some analyst claim  has been import buoy by outsiz expect of capit gain  expect that for a  e have been impervi to the level of the polici rate   in such a circumst  the fomc has to tighten to the point that it get the attent of those investor   but when it   get their attent and hous demand soften sudden  the committe will have to chang gear quick   the third explan relat to a hardi perenni in fomc transcript   over the year  mani of you or your former colleagu have said that your last action in ani phase of a polici cycl is alway a mistak   and you can   t look at the current configur of futur rate without wonder whether it is happen again   the committe might  howev  be will to accept tilt odd of over tighten if that were judg to be the least unattract altern   that is  a fund rate a littl higher than that consist with full resourc util for a  e may be seen as the necessari cost of counter inflat that has risen abov your comfort zone   note also that the extent to which market view you as roll back some portion of your anticip    basi point of addit firm will lessen the consequ of that near term polici path for the price of longer live asset and  presum  aggreg demand    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix      as can be seen in the second column of the tabl at the bottom left  the upward revis to near term polici expect flatten the yield curv somewhat  with rate on two year treasuri note rise    basi point compar with the    basi point gain in their ten year counterpart   as the bar at the right show  the rise in nomin rate was more than account for by an increas in their real compon  especi at short matur  and inflat compens edg lower   this rise in real rate  along with the declin in equiti valu shown in the bottom two row of the tabl  impli that financi market condit tighten over the intermeet period   as shown in the top panel of exhibit    such a tighten  against the backdrop of weakish data on spend  might inclin you to keep the fund rate unchang at   percent today   such concern would be particular acut if you interpret the anecdot and survey measur of particip in the hous market  as in the middl left panel  for instanc  as suggest a more pronounc hous slump than embed in the staff forecast   but you might see some reason to paus now even if you bought into the basic contour of the  book outlook   es  polici rule explain the committe   s behavior over the past eighteen year that are fed outcom for inflat and the output gap as in the staff forecast  plot as the dash line in the middl right panel  predict that you will be lower the polici rate   similar  the simul shown in the bluebook and repeat in the remain panel suggest that  with a   percent inflat goal and specif assumpt about your prefer  you   d also be satisfi with a fund rate no higher than   percent   in that scenario  howev  you   d be will to accept core pce inflat  the bottom right figur  run at     percent for almost one year   market particip  in part learn from your public comment  evid view you as unwil to accept such an outcom  and if your own assess of the economi has evolv in the same direct as that of the staff  then your near term polici choic have probabl gotten more unpalat   as can be seen in the top panel of exhibit    the  book outlook for unemploy  at the left  and for core pce inflat  at the right  has worsen over the cours of this year   we tri in the bluebook to summar the net consequ of the chang over the past six month in the forc shape the economi use the frb us model   in those simul  repeat in the middl panel  the polici that best accomplish the assum object and the result macroeconom outcom given by the current outlook  the solid line  are compar with those impli by the extend outlook at the  e of the januari bluebook  the dash line    in each of these simul  policymak are assum to have a long run inflat goal of     percent and to place equal weight on the three stabil object   output  inflat  and polici stabil   the current outlook impli a fund rate path that peak a bit abov     percent in mid      and then declin gradual to about     percent by       notic abov the rate call in januari   anoth aspect of the chang outlook  this  e seen from the perspect of financi market  is the rise in far ahead inflat compens  the red dot line in the bottom panel  over the past year   true  you may be hearten that inflat compens has move lower sinc the outbreak of jitter in late april and that  as note in the inset box  chang in polici expect prompt by offici statement appear to have been associ with a declin in far ahead inflat compens  but concern about investor    confid in your commit to price stabil  wit by the posit correl of data surpris and inflat compens over the same period  are probabl at the root of a decis to tighten at least    basi point today and signal that more may come  the subject of exhibit     as can be seen in the top panel  a   point move today would posit the real fund rate more assur abov the center of staff es  of it neutral level   and put some weight on the simul present in the bluebook  if your inflat goal is     percent  as in the middl panel  you may see the need to move the nomin fund rate up from   percent some  soon   inde  if you put a particular high prioriti of the attain of that goal   as in the dash line   even more tighten is in store   as shown in the bottom panel  the prevail market sen ent is toward a   point firm today  which has been a compel  but not conclus  argument for action in the past   the key question for each of you is  what probabl do you place on anoth   point firm in august   the solid line in the bottom left figur plot the impli probabl current in financi market of tighten at both the june and the august fomc meet   when draft the statement  we thought an    percent market probabl of such a dual action was on the high side of what you would prefer   so  in tabl    which is updat as your last exhibit  we put a few marker to rein in expect of action in august   note that the rational paragraph assert that growth is moder and repeat reason that inflat might be held in check   more import  the assess of risk is also couch in term of your goal rather than just the polici instrument   my bet is that  with the releas of the statement  the odd would go to       on action in august  but you should probabl view that as no more inform than the flip of a coin
ani question for     if not  then we   re readi to start  the go round on polici   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the altern b action of    basi point and the languag in the statement that was pass out last night   although output has soften  it   s not clear how much and for how long   what is clear is that inflat has been run higher   that   s a given   that has been in the data   we   ve had some warn over the past week and month that inflat expect aren   t as firm anchor as we might have hope they were   they have come down a bit  but when they   ve edg back down  it has been larg on expect that we would be firm at this meet and on the mark up of our path   so i think it   s import to cement that in and to take that action today   it   s import to recogn the inflat risk that we all acknowledg in our discuss ye day   i think    basi point would be too much   the economi is slow   there has been a consider tighten of financi condit over this year   long term interest rate are up    to    basi point over the past six month  includ    basi point in real rate   this increas wasn   t just inflat expect   some of the increas has happen over the past coupl of month  and i think it   s quit like that we haven   t seen the full effect of those rate increas on activ   so we alreadi have some slow of activ  and i think there   s a littl more to come  or at least some addit damp from tighten in the pipelin   we do need to keep our eye on the forecast here   as i said ye day  a good deal of the inflat increas that we   ve gotten has been a consequ of energi price and mayb the price effect in owner    equival rent  which are so difficult to analyz and predict   these price effect should dissip  so i   m certain expect inflat to come down as they come out   we need to be care about inflat expect and not overreact to incom data on inflat  but we shouldn   t ignor them either   i think that would be a mistak   the whole thing is veri uncertain  and i think that inflat  even after a move of    basi point  will remain the greatest risk to our object  at least until we get much more data that growth inde is slow to below potenti   in that regard  i like the element in the altern b statement   in paragraph    it   s import to acknowledg that we recogn that the economi is moder   that was a predict last  e  and i think we can be confid enough to say it   s an actual this  e  to recogn that a lot of that slow is in the hous market  and to recogn the lag effect of increas in interest rate   it   s import for the rest of the world to know that we have our eye on that   in paragraph    we need  as i said  to acknowledg that inflat has been too high and that there are some thing work in a good direct  such as product gain and unit labor cost   there is a risk that inflat could remain higher than we want it to   in paragraph    it   s import to recogn that the slow of growth should help to limit inflat pressur  at least keep them from build further  but that our primari focus is on inflat risk   this is a good  e to step back a bit from predict where interest rate are go to go becaus i think we   re less certain about where they are go to go  and so i was glad to see    some further polici firm may yet be need    was taken out   we still have a predict in there by say    the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need      it should be clear that in the view of the committe the next move is more like to be up than down   but it   s a less definit statement than it was befor  and i think it   s appropri to take that slight step back at this  e   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
as i said ye day  although the outlook for real growth is notic softer than it was at the last meet  it  sn   t seem to me clear inconsist with growth around trend go forward   i see the risk of slow the economi over much in the near term by increas real rate as relat low   the way i look at the evid  real short term interest rate are still somewhat low by histor standard   if you compar the period of extend growth  such as the late     s  it look as though they come in between   and   percent and center near   percent or so  although i know there are mani way to measur them   right now it appear that  by the same sort of measur  the real fund rate is between     and   percent   so i still sens that the real rate is low by histor standard for a period of econom expans like the one we seem to be in now   my sens is that we may need to rais rate beyond today becaus it seem clear to me that we   re not pleas with recent inflat or the inflat outlook   the rate of inflat has been substanti higher over the past few month than we would like  and i think the level of inflat expect is too high as well  although i recogn some of the subtleti involv in gaug inflat expect accur   moreov  inflat expect appear to be unnecessarili fluctuat  we   ve been on someth of a rollercoast ride for the past few month   inflat expect rose when the public wasn   t sure how we would respond to the oil price shock  just as they did after katrina  and inflat expect came down as they did last octob and novemb onli after we communic our intent   these up and down realli serv no use purpos in my view   last night at dinner  rachel lomax made a relev remark about the extent to which their regim anchor inflat expect and caus firm to adjust to oil price increas  not by pass through but by cut wage and cost elsewher   i think that   s a relev exampl here   to say that some inflat current is a consequ of oil price increas is incomplet  as we all know  becaus the extent to which oil price increas pass through to overal inflat is entir a consequ of the polici reaction function that is either in place or is view as be in place by the public   now  i   m not go to claim that this is the end of the world   this isn   t the     s   i think the credibl of our commit to not let inflat rise to    percent is veri secur   but we ought to be abl to improv upon a polici regim and an accompani equilibrium in which expect for ten year ahead inflat fluctuat as much as they have over the past sever month   so i agre with governor kohn that we ought to rais rate at this meet   we ought to leav open the option in our statement that we could rais rate again   i think it   s veri import to use today   s statement to clarifi our intent regard inflat  otherwis we   re like to be in for more rollercoast ride in the month and quarter ahead   i have two concret recommend about the statement   first  note that on june   the chairman character recent inflat read as    unwelcom      a veri import word that harken back to the word the committe use in      to communic a lower bound on the rang of inflat rate the committe consid consist with price stabil   we should use that word again today in our statement to communic that we do not view current inflat read as consist with price stabil   i   m afraid that fail to do so would be a glare omiss and would unnecessarili perpetu ambigu about our intent   my second recommend about the statement has to do with the assess of risk  the first sentenc in altern b  row    that read     although the moder in the growth of aggreg demand should help to limit inflat pressur over  e  the committe judg that some inflat risk remain      place anticip of an aggreg demand slowdown front and center in our assess of inflat dynam seem odd to me in light of all of the talk around this tabl over the recent year about how flat the relationship is between aggreg demand and inflat   moreov  even with the sentenc that follow it in that paragraph  it seem to impli that we   re will to simpli wait for a moder of inflat rather than take suffici action ourselv   given the  book   s forecast  it ask a relat modest output gap to do a whole lot of work   it also   but this is a sort of broader doctrin issu   risk leav the impress that our methodolog for control inflat is to manipul aggreg demand  and i   m not sure that   s entir accur   the assess of risk sentenc in altern c would be much more appropri than the first sentenc in altern b   it state clear what we would like to see happen with inflat      in order to fo  price stabil and a sustain econom growth  the committe seek a medium term declin in core inflat from it recent elev level      my sens is that this is someth that everyon around the tabl want   a medium term declin in core inflat  if that   s the case  we ought to state it clear to the public   these two chang would send a much clearer messag about our focus on inflat risk   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll start by say that i support    basi point today   mani of us  includ especi the chairman  help to shape market expect that we   re go to do that today  and i think not to carri through  given that we shape market expect  would be veri unfortun   befor i get to the statement  i want to tri to state as clear as i can what my posit is on the substanc of what we ought to do  think about the clariti in the formul of the statement as have to preced the discuss of it with the public   i was struck in our discuss ye day by the differ around the tabl in the degre of op  about the real economi  the  book outlook is perhap on the low side of the rang around the tabl  and some of those who support that view give some weight to the possibl of a weaker outcom than the  book outcom   other are more op ist than the  book  and they put some weight on a stronger outcom than even their point es    so that produc a rang of view about the real economi  but i believ that the rang is well within the normal bound of profession disagr and well within the normal forecast error   now  how would we character our polici stanc come out of this meet  assum that we rais    basi point   i think that the right way to character the stanc  and this is what i was tri to say in the memo that i distribut earlier  is that a fed fund rate of      percent would be a stanc of mild restraint   let me give you just a short list of some of the thing that lead me to believ that   this list is in no particular order  although i suppos it   s not an accid that i   m go to put money growth at the top of the list   we have slow and  inde  slow growth of mzm  money zero matur  and m   particular in recent week  i don   t put a lot of weight on the short run inform that we get  but what we see is consist with the view that polici has mild restraint   we   ve had some persist increas in real rate of interest this year  particular  as     note  sinc our last meet   we   ve had some modest declin in u s  equiti market   that is consist with mild restraint   we   ve had some dollar appreci sinc the may fomc meet   we   ve observ pretti clear some reduc activ in sector of the economi that are interest sensit  particular hous  and interest sensit may have someth to do with automobil as well   there have been some modest declin in commod price in recent week   again  not veri much  just a bit if you look at the chart against the context of what has happen   perhap there are some other thing that you would want to add to the list  but i don   t see anyth out there that would be a clear indic on the other side that would say that it is a glare except to the list of thing that i   ve given   so i think we have a stanc of modest restraint   it could well be that we will need addit restraint in the futur  but we should not have a clear presumpt that we will be rais the fund rate in the futur   the decis in august should depend on all the inform that we get between now and august  and we should not tri to build in a particular assumpt on the polici decis   in fact  if i were to be as neutral as i can be on this  i would say someth like    percent odd that we would hold steadi in august and    percent odd of anoth    basi point rais   you could take the mean of that and say     well  let   s just be done with it today and rais the fund rate an addit      basi point       laughter   but i think that would be pretti silli   the messag we ought to give to the market is that we have mild restraint in place  and we don   t know whether or not that will be enough to do the job   but if we get some unfortun addit news about the current inflat read  which i think we could easili get  i don   t want to be in a posit in which i have to prove my manhood  so to speak  by propos that we have more draconian increas in rate   if we believ that we alreadi have mild restraint in place and over  e it is go to be enough to do the job  then we don   t want to posit ourselv that in respons to market expect we have to act more   now  i don   t know that we have enough in place  but i don   t want to have a presumpt that what   s in place is inadequ at this point   i think that the inflat we have  includ the energi situat  is predomin from worldwid demand  we   re make a mistak if we ascrib veri much of it to suppli shock  we   ve had a veri strong worldwid expans   we know that china is soak up energi like crazi   that   s part of the veri strong worldwid demand situat   of cours  some of the chines success come back to produc demand in the unit state   they   ve order a lot of aircraft from boe  for exampl   now i   m go to get to the statement itself   all the altern help to creat a presumpt about the august meet   i understand from the paper this morn that the market has now bid into it a probabl of a move in august of more like    percent rather than     that obvious fluctuat from day to day   but we shouldn   t produc a presumpt   the way to avoid creat a presumpt but at the same  e to emphas our concern about inflat is to say  as i suggest in the memorandum i distribut  that we believ that we have mild restraint in place  assum that that view is accept around the tabl  which it may well not be   and that we will act in august on the basi of the incom inform  which may chang the outlook that we get   so that   s where i come out on this   thank you
thank you   presid   and presid pool have made some specif suggest   if addit speaker want to comment  that would be veri help   thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   base pure on the econom data  i consid it a close call between rais the fund rate    basi point today and paus   i definit think that polici should have a firm bias becaus inflat is too high   howev  i do consid polici to be mild restrict  and i see a lot of uncertainti right now about the prospect for both real gdp and inflat   my prefer would be to move up a bit more slowli  if in fact it turn out that we do need to tighten more  in order to allow addit  e to assess the econom situat as we go  in other word  the option valu of paus  especi in view of how close the next meet is  would have ideal  in my view  made it prefer to paus on pure econom ground today   there is a wide rang of possibl for the futur   i am deepli concern about the pace of core inflat in recent month  but as i said ye day  i take comfort from the continu strength in product growth  modest increas in wage  and the high level of markup   but it certain is a possibl that inflat will remain where it is or pick up even more than we have seen so far  and in that case  further action will sure be requir to bring it under control   i   m also quit awar of the possibl that output will slow much more than the  book expect and that the rise in inflat we   ve seen recent will turn out to be a temporari bulg   financi condit have tighten consider  and we may regret not get off the escal of rais the fund rate at each and everi meet becaus  if in fact output   slow down even more than the  book project  we will probabl overshoot the appropri level of the fund rate  perhap by a consider amount   in respons to presid     s comment about how we affect inflat  it seem to me that we do affect inflat by manipul aggreg demand   that is the channel through which monetari polici work   to my mind we have two goal  not one  and we are now in a regim with mild restrict polici so that we face a tradeoff between the pace at which we   re go to bring inflat back to our target and the path of unemploy along the rout   so although on pure econom ground i   d prefer to paus at this meet  i certain recogn that it would be difficult to leav the stanc of polici unchang at this  e   in general  i believ that we should do the right thing  even if it surpris market  but in this case our public statement seem to have convinc the public that we will rais the fund rate today  if we didn   t follow through  there would like be some loss of credibl for polici   moreov  as i   ve indic  i see today   s call as an except close one between firm and paus  therefor  i can certain support anoth increas in the fund rate of    basi point today   with respect to the statement  in respons to vinc   s point about what our polici choic is today  i believ our object should be to craft word that lower the market   s assess of the chanc that we   re go to move again in august below what it is  which is about    percent at this point   the revis statement   an excel job in accomplish that  and i endors the analysi of the statement that governor kohn gave as he went through the various part   i do find  howev  that i   m also attract to the word suggest by presid pool as an altern   it   s anoth way to accomplish the same thing  and it has the ad attract of includ the statement that we judg our stanc after today   s move as mild restrict   it   open up the distinct possibl of our paus in august  depend on the inform we receiv  to my mind  there is a real polici challeng as we go forward   polici   i agre with presid pool   is mild restrict   the  book forecast has unemploy move abov the nairu and inflat gradual come down   howev  assum that the inflat bulg is not a pure transitori one that will disappear rapid  the process for inflat to move down is go to take a while   the communic challeng i think we face and will face for quit a while is how we will live through a period in which inflat exceed our object   we need to express the idea that that is an unaccept long run situat   but i endors the comment that presid pool made   we have to make sure that everi  e we receiv an advers inflat read   and that could occur for quit some  e while the medicin of our polici is work   we don   t respond by rais the fund rate again
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i   d like to build on the comment by presid    presid pool  and presid     i want to address the languag first and the move second  follow presid     s lead of refer to last night   s dinner  i want to go back to a statement that governor king made last week   that the bank of england   s approach is to keep thing as simpl as possibl   they don   t say where interest rate will go next for the simpl reason that they don   t know and it would be quit mislead to pretend otherwis   listen to my colleagu at the tabl and address presid pool   s point and my own concern  i don   t know where we   ll go in august   i do think we should keep it simpl  in term of the word   and i   ll get to the move in just a minut   it strike me that the first sentenc in altern b as to the rational is correct and in keep with what we   ve heard at this tabl   i would then move on   i agre with presid     to say what we set out to do   but    ongo product gain    and    contain inflat expect should restrain inflat go forward    is the word from altern c  the second paragraph of the rational  i don   t like the word    read    becaus   and presid   has made a veri good point   we don   t want to be view as reactiv   i   d prefer the word    pressur         howev  recent pressur on core inflat have been elev  which the committe view as unwelcom     then i agre with presid     to clarifi our intent  i would not use in altern b the paragraph   that we have   i wouldn   t use ani of it  and i   ll come to the reason in a second   i would just say that    in order to fo  price stabil and sustain econom growth  the committe seek a medium term declin in core inflat from it current elev level      by the way  i don   t like the second sentenc of paragraph   in the current altern b becaus  as a former market oper  i take from it that we intend to rais rate again   the slippag in there revolv around the word    ani addit firm    and the word    may     again  given my background  i read from those word that we   re bias toward rais rate again  and i don   t think that   s where we are   at least that   s not where i am   i would also make a plea  which i think i do at almost everi meet  to elimin from row   the word    in ani event    and just say     the committe will respond to chang      as to the move itself  the real epiphani i had last night was after dinner drive home  i   m about to go on vacat  and i was think about golf   besid the wisdom that i garner at dinner   in think about golf  i was think about the u s  open   what happen at the u s  open was that the fellow who was in the lead  phil mickelson  went for broke   the fact is that this is a team sport    by the way  mr  chairman  i want to congratul you for the way you conduct these meet  becaus i realli do feel   and i think all of us feel   as part of a team   but the sequenc of event here is that we   re go to releas a statement after we announc our move  you   re go to testifi on monetari polici  and then the minut are go to be releas  if i understand the  e sequenc correct   the market look to the chairman   even though this is a team sport  you can go back in histori  and you can think of various analog   just to kill my golf analog here  we might consid paul volcker as bobbi jone and alan  span as an octogenarian tiger wood  and so on   your word will be care weigh  in argu for a spars statement  i think the market will be focus on what you say  and then it will look at the minut  and that   s where we amplifi  if we wish to amplifi or respond to incom data   just to finish the golf analog  i think our job in term of the amount that we move is to put the ball back onto the fairway so you can approach the     i think    basi point is the best altern  so i support the    basi point move  and i would urg you to consid the word chang that have been put forth by presid   and by presid pool   thank you  mr  chairman
is that two hand   vice chairman
let me just clarifi for a second   so you think we should move today but then leav expect flat  not       on anoth increas
i don   t know where we   re go to go next   i do believ we should move  i also believ  by the way  that the economi is stronger than the  book say   i made that clear in my statement   i was tempt to suggest ad    somewhat    after the word    moder     but moder is moder   i   m not sure where we go next  and i   m not sure that we should signal becaus i think we don   t know   this get partial at presid     s point and certain to presid pool   s point   the word as it is     is too direct   like presid    i would prefer to clarifi our intent as it appear in column c here in the fourth box   i don   t think we need to say much more and should leav amplif to the tes oni and to the minut   that   s my point     that answer your question
well  i would have a hard  e reconcil     s comment with the one that follow   in some way we need to make a choic   it may be true that we   re not sure at this point what   s go to make sens beyond june  but we need to make a conscious choic about what we want to do with the expect the market now has   therefor you can   t evad that realiti   you have to conscious decid what you want to do with those expect   you have to decid fundament whether you want to leav them neutral  push them down  or push them up   i was tri to read where you would be on that spectrum
first of all  we announc a   point move   second  we say that we are worri   we use the word    unwelcom      the inflationari pressur  the core inflat pressur  are unwelcom   we state veri clear what our intent is  and we state that we   re go to respond to chang    i think our action is then address in a veri straightforward way by the word that we use without indic that we   re like to move still further  becaus i don   t have the confid that we will move still further   but we   re make it veri clear we   re not go to toler obvious extrem or harsh inflationari pressur that we   re see in the core
it sound as though your object with those chang would be to push up expect
no  i don   t want to indic that we   re go to move when we   re not sure we   re go to move
i would have read the net effect of your propos chang as push up expect   even if we   re uncomfort with how much confid we have about where we want expect to be  we need to make a choic about what we want to do   and i would have read the net effect of those chang as push up expect or leav them unchang
well  mr  chairman  i disagre with the read   we come from differ perspect   howev  we do need to bear in mind that we have this statement  we have your tes oni  we have the releas of the minut  and all of those are tool that we should use   let me just leav it at that
just a factual question     said that the sequenc is that you testifi first and then the minut come out   is that accur
the minut are releas three week from today   tes oni is tentat schedul to be the day befor and the same day   is that right
so the tes oni is wednesday  and the minut are releas thursday   the first leg of the tes oni is on wednesday  the second leg is on thursday
i don   t disagre with the import of tri to assess the effect of our statement on the immedi post statement probabl that the market place on our move in august   but i   d just point out  by the  e we get to august  the effect of intermeet news on that assess will in some sens swamp this   how the market react to that news and how they view us as like react to that incom news are go to be import   i have express some dismay at what has happen between the march meet and now   i wasn   t unhappi with the march meet post statement assess by the market   i   m unhappi with the way the market react to the news  how they infer that we   d react to the news that came in   so i think that  although the focus on what the likelihood is of a move in august is import  i don   t think we should lose sight of how we want market to interpret incom news and what that mean for our polici go forward
the word in altern c   which say that  in order to fo  price stabil  we seek a medium term declin in core inflat from it recent elev level   put into context  presid    how we   re like to deal with intermeet data   that   s our intent
on       s point  we come out of this meet with a clear asymmetri in the sens that what   s on the tabl for august is either zero or up      the question is  what kind of probabl of up    would we like to encourag the market to think about come out of the meet    i said that i would like it to be sort of        and let the data between now and august determin the result and not go into the next meet essenti have creat the presumpt of up      that   s my posit
okay   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor the   point increas in the feder fund rate at this meet   there are lot of consider that go into it  but a princip one in my mind is that it   s import  and perhap essenti  to take that action to anchor inflat expect and perhap even to reduc them a bit   so that   s where i come out on the action   as far as the statement is concern  it seem to me that we want to strike some sort of balanc between the possibl  mayb the probabl  that we ought to increas the fund rate further  perhap even more than onc at subsequ meet  with the possibl that we may also find it appropri to paus  perhap not too far off  part becaus of the lag between our action and their effect and the fact that we   ve move quit a bit   i use the languag    some sort of balanc    becaus  as i think the discuss has alreadi suggest  it   s go to be veri difficult to find someth that i would consid fulli appropri and that everybodi els around the tabl would find fulli appropri as well   so i would be happi with ani statement that strike that balanc in a reason way   i think altern b larg   that  and i can certain go along with the languag in b   i   m go to resist the temptat to fine tune it  except to tilt at one windmil and say that i wouldn   t use the word    unwelcom      if we want to make the point  we should say    too rapid        too high        inconsist with price stabil     or someth direct   whi we would want to be coy isn   t clear to me
thank you  mr  chairman   given our recent disappoint inflat experi and  more import  our forecast that suggest that inflat is like to move at least somewhat higher over the forecast period  i   m solid in favor of a    basi point move today  like some other  i am less sure about the need for further increas at subsequ meet   as ye day   s discuss highlight  our near term polici decis look to have becom somewhat harder   there is the possibl that output may be slip to below potenti  and inflat has yet to respond in ani convinc way to the tighter polici   like other  even given that possibl problem  i am more concern about the upsid inflat risk  given what i consid to be the greater consequ of an unwelcom develop on the inflat side   despit that lean  i would emphas the increas uncertainti we now face and the need to maintain some flexibl with regard to our subsequ polici action   i want to go back to the last point i made  or tri to make  in ye day   s discuss   the possibl polici corner into which we may have unwit paint ourselv   let me explain what i mean by that   in an effort to underscor our individu commit to low inflat  mani   and i think perhap most   of us have over the last coupl of year express a numer rang of price inflat that we would consid accept over the longer term   while those rang have not all been the same    to   percent on the core pce price measur has been the most often mention and the rang mani outsid comment have pick up as what they believ us to consid as our inform target   the problem that we now face in my view is that our forecast for inflat over at least the near term  and perhap extend into the intermedi term depend on how one defin that  e period    not have inflat move down even to the upper end of that rang   i was struck by the tabul of the forecast we turn in for the upcom congression tes oni   those show a central tendenc of    to     percent core pce inflat this year and   to    percent next year   the staff forecast were even higher  at     percent this year and     percent next year   use the confront languag of one of my grandkid  i will say     so      in other word  what are we go to do about it   i think it   s reason to expect that peopl are go to be ask that question of us more and more   more import  we should be ask that question of ourselv   i find it interest to think back as to how we may have individu hit upon   to   percent core pce inflat as reason and achiev   i think it was substanti influenc by our veri favor experi dure the      to      period  when we did have the measur comfort within that rang   but a decomposit of core pce inflat for that period suggest that such a benign experi may have been an aberr   dure that period  we experienc signific declin in good price  due larg to sharpli lower worldwid demand and the persist downward pressur on good price result from the emerg of china and other develop economi as good produc   that pattern of good price deflat has now chang  and good price in the aggreg are now not make a larg negat contribut to overal inflat   in other word  it   s hard to attribut that brief histor period of low core inflat to our domest monetari polici   it may have simpli been good luck   and i think it   s a weak reed upon which to base our longer run polici respons and prefer   the scenario in the  book that has below trend growth  unemploy abov    percent  and near term inflat acceler underscor the difficult polici choic we may face   and the bluebook   s model of what will be requir to get inflat back under   percent is sober   yet if we continu to espous a target rang of   to   percent and do not behav in a way that seem to move us decis in that direct  then i think we run the risk of a substanti loss of polici credibl   final  altern c in today   s bluebook tabl   hint at the kind of action and statement languag that would seem to be consist with a commit to get back well within a rang of   to   percent   i would not advoc that we go there today  but i think that construct serv to remind us of the need to begin to have such a discuss around this tabl   with regard to today   s statement  i like the way the various draft have evolv  and i am general comfort with the latest altern b languag that we have befor us   i was veri uncomfort with earlier languag that toy with the notion of comment on and forecast sever veri specif variabl   i would urg us not to use the statement to elabor on a rational for our action or to highlight a particular data seri   i believ that   s best left to the minut   thank you  mr  chairman
presid guynn  i just want to make a comment that  when i give my tes oni  i will have the committe   s forecast for year and a half ahead  which are condit on op  monetari polici  so i   ll be abl to say that this is what we think we can achiev reason over the next year and a half   ani issu of where we may want to be in the veri long run is  at this point  i think moot   i take your point that we have not  as a committe  decid even to announc a quantit price stabil measur much less choos a specif one  and perhap we should be more cautious about that   but in the near term  as     s simul show  get to the     percent in the simul take us five year   we don   t want to creat an impress that we are tri to achiev that kind of object in a year or a year and a half  and i will make that point veri clear in my tes oni   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   with our decis in may to set the feder fund rate target at   percent  i felt that we had move the fed fund rate to a level that was slight abov neutral   i thought at that  e that the cumul effect of our previous action  along with other element in the outlook  might enabl us to consid a paus at this meet   other at that meet weren   t quit as sanguin  and i said at that  e that i perceiv two distinct posit regard a rate hike at this meet   those who were lean in that direct and look for the data to talk them out of it and those who were lean against an increas and look for the data to talk them into it   i was in that latter group  and the data have inde talk me into anoth    basi point increas in our fed fund rate target today   i   m just as wari now as i was in may of push the fed fund rate beyond the level necessari to restrain inflationari pressur  but my concern about the real side of the economi have been trump by what i perceiv as a signific shift in the risk to our price stabil object   for some  e now  i   ve been expect to see headlin inflat slow down even as we see a drift up in core inflat   we may yet find that some of the influenc of energi and hous price on the inflat statist are transitori and that they   ll wane   nevertheless  i   m less confid of that posit today than i was in may  and i can   t comfort ration the recent string of bad inflat report that we   ve seen   fortun  some of the wobbli in inflat expect that concern us in may appear to have stabil becaus of the belief that the committe will respond to the latest inflat report with a rate increas today   i think it   s import to valid those expect   as other state previous  i   m also not prepar to say with ani convict today what i will be prepar to do in august   as   point out  the market are current expect anoth rate increas in august   i would prefer to see that probabl closer to        and i hope that   is correct that our languag is go to move the market in that direct   in term of our statement  i was readi to support presid     s two suggest in the statement  take    unwelcom    inflat  which appear in both altern a and c  and use it in b   but after hear presid  n   s question about what it mean  i   m not so sure that i would use    unwelcom    in altern b   presid     s second suggest  of take the first sentenc in paragraph   of altern c and use it as the first sentenc in altern b  address those concern   it convey that the committe seek a declin in core inflat  which is more specif than    unwelcom    inflat   even though i understand that the transmiss mechan of monetari polici is through the slow of aggreg demand  i would prefer that our statement be more forthright about what we are tri to achiev as an object   that   s what i think that sentenc in altern c     it say that we are seek to fo  our object of price stabil and sustain econom growth and are seek to see a declin in core inflat   so my prefer is altern b with a chang in the first sentenc in paragraph     thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m in favor of increas rate    basi point   i like to think i   m in favor of it not becaus that   s what the market expect but becaus it   s the right thing to do   at some point  i hope we can surpris the market by do the right thing but not have it be necessarili what   s fulli expect   i   m in favor of the    basi point most becaus i think we need to hedg the bet that slower econom growth will rein in the outsiz increas in inflat that we   ve seen prompt in part by jump in energi cost   but i don   t think we need to start engag in an all out war on inflat   we   ve increas rate seventeen  e or so  there has been some upward movement in the long end of the yield curv  and we face the risk that we will overdo   in that regard  i had a realli hard  e convinc onli a bare major of my board   and you saw this in action  ben   to vote for an increas in the primari credit rate on our last telephon call  as most of them see the amount of tighten alreadi in the work as suffici given what they see as the downsid risk to growth   so i am concern that we could find ourselv overdo  particular if we continu on this upward path   perhap the greatest challeng we   re go to face is figur out when to stop   that take me to presid     s propos and presid pianalto   s comment   i   m not one who would like to start a polici that look to take inflat down to the level that we saw in      and        presid guynn made veri good point about the fact that our experi with veri low level of inflat  a grow economi  and so forth over the past decad or so may have in fact been part and parcel of uniqu factor at the  e   so when i see longer run inflat scenario in which you can choos     percent or   percent  i realli wonder about the sacrific ratio of move from   percent to     percent and build in a polici pre commit to that   if you take the word in altern c and match it with some of the languag that has been out there recent  you will build into the market an expect that we are hell bent on take the inflat rate down no matter what   that   s too much emphasi on one of our goal at the sacrific of the other   so i think we need to have some leeway in the statement to paus  mayb in august  mayb later   i   m veri attract to governor kohn   s pars of the statement   when i look at the statement last night  i wasn   t anywher near as inclin to agre to it as i am now after his walk through it   i do think that  by our elimin some of the languag that was there last  e  it give us some flexibl in august   so although there are mani way to shorten it and there may be mani way to make it clearer  i think that edit it at this tabl   not realli help a whole lot   i would be in favor of both    basi point and the statement as it now stand
thank you   first vice presid stone
thank you  mr  chairman   i support rais the fund rate    basi point  both on the merit and for our credibl   on the merit  i think that certain  as we discuss ye day  the risk to growth are higher than they were at the may meet but inflat risk and the recent news on inflat are certain tilt to the upsid   so on the merit  i support an increas   on the credibl side  the market    expect are built as much on what we   ve said as on what they read in the econom number  and we need to follow through on those expect   i think it would be a mistak not to   now  as to the word  i have to admit i   ve been torn   the simul that the staff ran were relat sober   there   s like a greater probabl of need to rais rate further  but i don   t think we   re readi to use the languag in altern c  it just  sn   t send the right messag at this point   i think there is an amount of uncertainti   i could spend a lot of  e tinker with the languag in altern b  but i   m prepar to support the languag in altern b the way it is   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m glad that everyon agre that the strength of a good committe is for someon to disagre  becaus my prefer  base on the assess of the outlook  is to maintain the fund rate at   percent  and i would vote accord if i were a vote member   even though the financi market clear expect a move to    percent at this meet  my read of the evid suggest that such a move is not necessarili requir at this  e   base on what i know  a   percent rate is moder restrict and will  given  e  result in an eas of inflationari pressur as the economi slow in the period ahead    our challeng should be to maintain this rate as the economi begin to slow  until we have inflationari pressur clear reced  becaus there will be pressur to eas as soon as the slow of the economi intensifi   i think that   s where our mistak will be made   i have everi concern about inflat   but the number that we   re see are in the past  they   re from polici action we took in the past  and there   s not a lot we can do about them look backward   we should be prepar to switch   if the econom data show a reacceler of the economi  then we will have real caus to make a move up   but so long as the economi is slow and project show that it is slow  then we are restrict   mild restrict  as presid pool said   and we should hold firm until we bring inflat down   i think we are implement restrict polici  and what we   re choos today in rais the rate reflect our desir to steepen the project downward inflationari trend   our choic today reflect our willing to increas the risk of overshoot in an effort to decreas the risk of undershoot   that   s the tradeoff we   re make today    so i would hold off  i would be patient  and i would be firm in keep the rate at   percent until we see the inflat number come down   that is  if i were choos   in the languag  i believ it is import to reemphas our commit to price stabil   i agre with that   at the same  e  i do not think the risk are all one side  and i believ we need to state this in the releas   for exampl  i judg that monetari polici is now restrict or somewhat restrict  and we should say so   now  i agre with those who say nineteen peopl can   t write a statement  but that   s someth we should have in the statement go forward   moreov  in the current circumst  i believ it is veri difficult to devis forward look languag that will clear be understood by the financi market   obvious  we   re talk about that here and have troubl ourselv   so regardless of the decis at this meet  i think that it is especi import that we do not  by our choic of languag  pre commit to anoth increas in august   and i will leav it at that   thank you
presid hoenig  i think everyon around the tabl admir you for your consist posit    laughter
that   s a generous word  but thank you    laughter
mr  chairman
i just want to step in and say that i total agre with tom hoenig   s statement   at a  e when thing are so uncertain  it would be realli good if all of us could watch the languag that we use and not get ourselv into a situat where we feel  which i know i do  pre commit to someth   i   m in favor of this move   i would have been in favor of it probabl in ani event   but i do think there are reason to think care about the paus that presid hoenig has put on the tabl and that has been kind of taken out of our hand   we need to be concern about that at this  e
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the    basi point increas that you propos   let me make a coupl of comment   first  peopl have use the word    modest restraint     and    mild restrict      if we are somewhat restrict  it   s realli not veri restrict  we have increas interest rate    basi point sinc januari in nomin term   if you adjust for inflat  that   s    basi point   also  if you look at chart   in the bluebook and you look at the current fund rate  becaus of the increas in inflat we appear to be a littl below the equilibrium real fed fund rate today   so i take don   s point that long term rate have gone up  but on a histor basi they   re still quit low  as we all know   the second point is about the long term target   i realiz that these are simul and that they can chang  but when you look at the result of the simul  they are disturb becaus we don   t reach either target   if you have a   percent target or a     percent target  you don   t reach it by        so that certain was disturb to me when i look at the result   i agre with the object that peopl have state   our object in the statement should be to leav open the option for august as to whether we want to increas rate    basi point  whether we want to paus  or whether we want to increas more or have anoth increas after that   so we certain should leav all those option open   in term of the specif propos on the tabl  i thought that       s two point were veri interest   you could do both of them  or you could do one or the other   they both accomplish the same object   gari made the point that he didn   t like the phrase    unwelcom     you could say     read on core inflat have been elev in recent month  and that   s inconsist with price stabil      we could do someth like that or    unwelcom       one or the other   sandi favor the first sentenc in number     accomplish the same object  but i think includ one would add to the statement   final  i agre with what everyon has said   that the chairman   s tes oni  the minut  and the data that come out are go to have a great impact on the market   s expect for what we do in august   just one final littl edit   if you go with altern b  the first phrase in number       although the moder in the growth of aggreg demand should help to limit inflat pressur      sn   t belong there   i don   t disagre with the phrase  but i don   t think it belong in number     it realli belong in number    and there is a way to work it into number   if we start do that   i just put a marker down that i   d suggest that edit if we get to that point   i think it   s part of the rational  not an assess of risk   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support a    basi point move at this meet  and i share the object that mani of the peopl around the tabl have   i think we may have a bit of a disagr on how to achiev this object through the word in the statement   in the first part of the rational  our talk about the lag effect of increas in interest rate and energi price and the cool of the hous market is an import acknowledg of what we have been do and implicit get to the point that presid pool made about mild restraint becaus it is about the effect of our polici on what   s happen now and what   s go to be happen go forward   i would prefer not to use the languag about mild restraint   first  i agre with the point that it   s hard to know exact how much restraint we have   i think presid   made a veri good point by look at the simul that   has given us to show that such languag  at least in some interpret  would suggest that we   re not realli have veri much restraint   second  and veri import from a communic standpoint  if we say this now  then in the futur we   re alway go to have to character how much restraint we are have in the market   so then we have    mild restraint     then we have    modest     and then we take off the word in front   i think it get us into a veri bad dynam   so i would prefer to leav that idea implicit   it is import to have it in there  through the discuss of the lag effect of our polici   we could even say    lag effect of current polici     if we realli want to emphas someth like that   but i would prefer to go about it that way   with respect to some of the suggest that presid   has made  i think it   s veri clear that i veri much share his object and concern about unanchor expect   in each of the meet at which i have appear so far  i have talk about the import of maintain credibl and know full well the great cost of tri to reestablish credibl onc it is lost   that said  we have to put the movement that we   ve seen in expect over the past six week in a broader context  and i don   t think they   ve move all that much   i would prefer them not to be move up and down  i would prefer that we maintain veri clear credibl  but i don   t think that they   ve move a lot or move in a way that i consid suffici larg to be disturb   so from that point of view  i would be avers to includ the word    unwelcom      i consid the word    unwelcom    unwelcom in this statement  laughter  becaus i don   t think we need to say that or convey it in that way here   we can convey it through a varieti of other mean   but i share the broad object   i   m a bit wari of tri to bring in some of the altern c languag into altern b becaus i   m concern about the market   s focus too much on specif measur when we start talk about the medium term declin in core inflat   there may  then  be an overreact to pce number or cpi number that come out  and that would be a bit of my concern   someth that i veri much like in altern b at the end of the assess of risk is that we talk about the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth  which is veri much forward look and a bit more concret  which i think is veri valuabl and help to clarifi our object   final  someth that vice chairman   brought up   i think there   s a tension between what some peopl want to achiev and the languag that we   re go to use to achiev it   i concur broad with the comment that a number of peopl have made   that altern b will probabl bring down the market   s odd regard what we   re go to do in august from it recent elev level   we   re go to be get some import data   we   ll be get two employ report  so we   ll get to see whether the lower number in employ are temporari or not   after we see four or five month of data  we will be abl to start pull out whether someth is temporari or not   we have some other import number come up  and so i support basic keep altern b as it is   i think that is the best way to achiev the object of leav our option open but not in ani way unanchor expect
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i support the    basi point increas at this meet  and as sever peopl have said  i think the real issu is what we signal go forward   let me refer to some comment alreadi made and respond to some of my colleagu   presid pool  i   m sort of right where you are   i   m think       go forward  and so i   m lean toward the neutral languag that leav our option open   howev  i   m troubl  too  as governor   just said  about talk about our posit as restraint at the moment   i see where we are as have remov the excess accommod   i   m concern that if we call this restrict and if we want to backtrack  it might signal that we   re eas up again   i think we   re right in the sweet spot  and i don   t realli want to character it one way or anoth becaus  again  i think we   re where we need to be  the other comment i would make is that we   re still see bank loosen lend standard   there   s plenti of liquid out there   as governor   said ye day  peopl are leverag   price may be restrain  but there is liquid   credit spread are still veri  veri minim   from that perspect  the market  given what they   re see day to day in deal make  may react by ask how we can call it restrict  i like presid     s comment about move up the first sentenc of row    the first part about the moder in growth  to the rational   as we spoke around the tabl ye day  we were tri to decid what to do with these signal of inflat   how much of this inflat is transitori and how much will be work out as hous cool becaus  again  that is realli where the slowdown is come   the slowdown is come from hous  but that   s what we realli want to happen   by have the rate rise  we   ve pull the hot sector down closer to where we want it to be   if you look at section   of altern b  we realli are lay out whi we think inflat is head in the right direct   product gain are still good   unit labor cost  therefor  have been held down   inflat expect are contain   we could add to those point that the moder in aggreg demand will also help contain inflat   howev  we still have other pressur   i think the sentenc in row   support that rational  so i like the suggest that we move it  i also agre with the suggest that we take out the first word in the sentenc     read on core inflat    and just say    core inflat      i am open to say    unwelcom      it serv as a signal that we are anchor expect   some number as high as     are veri unwelcom to me  so i would be glad to stick the word    unwelcom    in there  the onli other thing i would say is that in number   i would just put a period after    outlook for both inflat and econom growth      to get everybodi focus on the outlook is what we   re all talk about   when we say    data depend     we mean that we need the data to valid our forecast or to modifi it   i think the market look at just the data  and i would just as soon put a period after    growth
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   let me support the move of    basi point on the merit   i don   t feel as though i   m constrain by market expect for this meet  rather  on the merit  i think that   s the right thing to do  befor get into a discuss of the languag  mayb i can give a coupl of perspect  mr  chairman  on the market themselv   my sens of thing is that a bit of a herd mental remain in the market in that they have been wait for our everi utter and  in some way  they have been guid by us for a veri  veri long  e   the discuss we   re have today is realli the tough one becaus we recogn that we need to wean the market from the degre of certainti that we no longer possess   i think this discuss is realli quit healthi in do so   in light of that perspect  i think that altern b strike the right balanc   without tri to wordsmith the statement at this point  i think that  although i share vinc   s view that ul  the market will get to a probabl for august that is more balanc  it will take some  e   that is  i think the market    first reaction to altern b and to the various version that we   re talk about will have some    sticki    to the view that they have now   they will believ that we have stop give them guidanc  that we   ve gotten out of that busi  and that we are somehow culpabl for that  we have led them to the river  and now we are tell them that what they do is realli their decis after all   my own view is that this shift is a veri  veri good thing  but it is not go to be without some pain  and i think swipe will be made at us   the chairman   s monetari polici tes oni will perhap repres just a littl bit of that  but a dispers of market view as to what we should be do  what the state of the economi is  and what the prospect are for inflat is a veri healthi thing   we will be introduc some volatil into the market  probabl in a more meaning way than they may have seen  but on balanc i think such a shift is all to the good  with that backdrop   that these market are not focus on nuanc   and the recognit that the discuss we   re have is about nuanc  let me say a few thing in support of altern b  first  in the rational section  where we say that inflat expect remain contain  i think the market will take a coupl of shot at us and say     boy  you said they were contain previous  you say they   re contain now   what was all that that we heard in between      the way that i get comfort with the statement that inflat expect are contain is that some of the movement in the market  in the inflat survey  in the tip market  and in the commod market show they have been respons to our view   i also feel that we can honest describ them as be contain  but the contain may be bigger than we had said it was befor   laughter   i guess i   m not troubl by that   if we introduc languag such as    unwelcom     the market would take it as a repris of the chairman   s remark from a few week ago and would take the view that we were anticip that they move up the fed fund futur market for august   i think that view would be veri problemat in light of what i hear is the central tendenc of peopl   s view here   that we want that bet to be fairer  closer to        and i fear that our histor use of    unwelcom    would go against what we   re collect tri to accomplish  let me make anoth comment  about the assess of risk where we say     the committe judg that some inflat risk remain      i think that peopl in the market are go to focus on the word    some         some    in recent meet has meant some further polici firm   that is  more than one move     some    was a strong word   in this context  after some  e and understand  which will not be at      or      or even today or tomorrow  they   re go to recogn that    some    actual weaken the statement somewhat   say    some inflat risk remain    rather than    the committe judg inflat risk remain    will  on balanc  modest lower the fed fund futur for august and beyond and will more like bring us back to a point where we will have a fair fight come our august decis   i think that take out    some    is like to be a good chang   so  on balanc  mr  chairman  i support altern b   some of the suggest that have been made about how to character our view vis  vis neutral and whether or not we   re mild restrict strike me as lead to a discuss in the market that might not be terribl help at this  e   our walk away from what the market perceiv to be firm and obvious guidanc is a bigger move for them than i think this discuss may be suggest  and i   d rather not add a new notion of neutral  and a discuss about whether we are less loos or more tight strike me as inopportun at this moment  i concur with a comment that presid   made at the outset about think about our august decis with an option model theori approach   this approach is basic that we don   t want to exercis that option until we have to   altern b preserv our option  on balanc  for a fair fight and a fair discuss come the august meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
just veri quick  i think we should rememb that the core pce index come out tomorrow   if that   s an unfortun number  it   s go to be right up against what we say  and peopl might say     some inflat risk   we   ve got a bad number   where are these guy anyway      so i would vote for take the    some    out and for say     inflat risk remain
thank you  mr  chairman   i would read our discuss ye day as impli a central tendenc to our forecast of an economi that   s grow basic at potenti over the forecast period with a trajectori for inflat that is higher than we   d like if it were to extend over  e and that moder slowli and modest over that period  and the risk of that forecast are still slight to the upsid   even if we were all quit confid about that basic forecast and had the same view of the risk around it  we couldn   t say that we actual know at this point how much more tighten we will need to achiev our target  i think it   s obvious that we should move today   i think we need to send a signal that we want the fed fund rate to have a posit slope go forward   achiev the probabl of       around a move in august would be terrif  but i don   t know if we can do that   we want to have as much flexibl as we can have   we want the market   s expect about polici to be respons to the data go forward  not sticki becaus of anticip of what we   re go to do  and i think  of cours  that we don   t want to pre commit   i believ that altern b actual   a veri nice job of achiev this object   but it   s all about the altern  and i think that altern b  like democraci  is better than the altern    laughter  i think we face two type of risk now   one risk  which i think   articul best ye day  is that we may alreadi be in the midst of what will prove to be a more acut adjust in hous and a much more dramat respons by household to the chang in expect about futur incom and wealth and that the save rate has been unsustain low and will have to rise more signific   that is a plausibl scenario go forward   a second risk is that  under an expect that we stop at       we may be left below the op  path for polici   i want to say two thing emphas that risk  even though i don   t think we can judg it as the predomin one  first  to echo what i said ye day  if you look back at where we thought we would end and where we thought prevail es  of the neutral rate were  we have been way under and the market has been way under   the bluebook es  of now prevail equilibrium illustr a basic     basi point move in es  equilibrium over this period  and the market   s expect of the termin rate have move a lot   so we may have been too loos for too long  and we may have to do more move to adjust for the effect that our stanc has had on inflationari behavior  inflat accept  psycholog  and momentum  the op  control exercis   and i thought the memo that you gave us befor the meet was veri help   left me a littl troubl becaus you can read those exercis as say that  if our object for inflat realli is      we   re go to have to be tighter than    percent  and if you relax the assumpt around smooth  you get a signific higher near term path for the fed fund rate that is judg to be op   but even with that  those exercis impli a view about inflat persist that say we   re go to be abov     percent for a veri  veri long  e   that situat  as i said    creat some risk that peopl will read the persist of inflat as impli that we have higher inflat toler than we do or it may make us vulner to some further gradual eros in credibl   so it   s possibl that we   re go to need to be higher than the fund rate path assum in the  book  but we just don   t know  and we don   t need to make that judgment today   we do not want to tri to cap expect at ani particular level and hold them down  just a few thing on the suggest made   all the suggest were veri thought  but i would oppos all of them    laughter   the rise in core inflat would be unwelcom if it was sustain or if it repres an expect path for inflat that was signific higher than the central forecast   to say that a bulg like the one we   ve seen today  given what we think is drive it  is unwelcom increas our vulner to the percept that we   re go to be a littl too backward look   we need the flexibl to stop at the point where core inflat is still acceler  and    unwelcom    would limit our capac to do that  i think governor   was exact right in resist the suggest that we character our current stanc of polici as somewhat restrict   we don   t know how restrict polici is  but even if we did  we should not be in the busi of calibr a judgment in our statement about how restrict we are   most import  the statement say implicit what i think  bill  you   re tri to achiev  which is to convey that we see monetari polici as get some traction on the economi today   we also don   t need to be quit as vivid in say our expect is to bring core inflat down over the medium term to some implicit level      medium term      have a lot of flexibl in it  but as the op  control exercis suggest  we don   t realli know what the cost are of adopt a specif horizon now for bring inflat down from what is onli a veri small deviat from our implicit target  i think that altern b strike a good balanc now  and each suggest would alter that balanc in a way that would not be as good at captur the consensus about the trajectori that was describ ye day   so i support move    today and the languag in altern b
okay   thank you all veri much
just a coupl of comment in respons to a few thing  if that   s all right  mr  chairman
first  the statement languag that we   ve been use in row   to tri to influenc the probabl that we   d like to see immedi after the statement of the next move has conflat two thing   it has combin our assess of the probabl of various data come in and our intent about how we   re like to react to those data   as a result  when data come in  they have a short shelf life  and not too far out into the intermeet period the market becom uncertain becaus we haven   t told them separ what our intent are  what guid how we respond to the data   that   s whi i think altern c  which say someth about what we   re about  is go to anchor inflat much better  presid  n  i take your comment to mean that you favor someth that   s synonym with    unwelcom    but less coy  and i welcom that suggest  we haven   t realli given     s simul  and the infer that we can draw from them about the feasibl path of inflat  a lot of discuss or scrutini   i   d be interest to know whether the way in which the evolut of inflat expect is model in those simul is consist with the possibl of more sudden and fa  chang in those expect   as we saw  for exampl  in the middl of      and as seem to have taken place over the last two intermeet period  though with small fluctuat   it strike me that they leav out of the entir simul the possibl of our communic influenc those expect in a more rapid way   this is a debat that goe back three decad  and i don   t think we   re go to settl it here today   but my reaction to those simul is that it certain seem plausibl to me that we could establish more rapid in the public   s mind our intent to aim for inflat at     percent   and i don   t think we should shi away from attempt to communic in a way to help that process along  stop when core inflat is acceler seem to me high implaus   i doubt that we would be will to take that risk with the market   that   s exact the problem we ran into in late april with the jec tes oni   in the presenc of declin inflat  the thing that peopl singl out from that statement was the remark that we may paus even if inflat risk are on the high side   that statement probabl did more to call thing into question in these last two intermeet period than anyth els   so  again  i think we need to focus on the way market are go to interpret news come in and the way they   re go to understand how we   re go to react   that   s whi i   ve been harp on intent
not to beat a dead hors here  but i think we have to be sensit to the fact that we   re go through a veri difficult  e right now   after two or three year of the market   s have a good deal of certainti about exact what we were go to do  see no other path for polici but up from veri low level  we   re in an environ in which everybodi realiz there   s a great deal of uncertainti   i don   t think we should extrapol from the way a particular piec of inform is receiv or remark upon in this period to our further discuss of where we stand with regard to our statement and the kind of thing that we want to talk about  core inflat is a backward look number by definit   there will be  e in which we will not want to move on our assess of the forecast even when core inflat is rise  and i don   t think that we should view that decis as less of a commit to inflat but rather as a reason balanc of our two goal   whatev happen after the jec tes oni is more indic of the period we   re go through and less indic of how we should think about the way in which we communic   we   ve got to keep the balanc in mind   if we don   t keep the balanc in mind  i believ we are subject to overreact  and the economi pay a penalti for that   i don   t think we should be insensit to that
well  let me thank you all veri much for your extrem help and use comment   i  too  think that we should rais    basi point at this meet   i think it   s justifi by the basic econom situat   the greater risk seem to be from inflat  i think also  follow some thing that presid   said  that a credibl   psycholog issu is go on here   late in april  perhap becaus of my tes oni  we had a small inflat scare   the tip spread widen   the commod price  metal price  essenti went vertic for a while   the minut  my remark  the remark of other presid and governor succeed in bring those expect down signific  even though we had two upsid surpris in the cpi dure that period   so obvious some connect exist between our talk and market expect  have said that  i think we need to do what we say we   re go to do  now  condit on what we know today  i should also add that i think we   re get veri close to where we need to be   we don   t know for sure yet   obvious we have to look for more inform  but in our public utter go forward we should be somewhat more balanc about the risk and also somewhat more uncertain about where we   re go in the futur   the risk manag calcul associ with this move are quit difficult   presid pool has mention the risk that if inflat expect get embed at a higher level  it would be much more expens to reduc them later than it is to nip them in the bud  so to speak  at this point   that risk argu for move earlier rather than wait to see what happen   that be said  i recogn that there are also some downsid risk  some potenti nonlinear in hous market and financi market   so where i come out is that i think we should move but tri to keep our option open and to move slowli if we do move further  with respect to the statement  i   m the first to agre it   s not a work of art   we have a veri difficult balanc act here   first  we have achiev some credibl gain in the past few week  we   d like to hold onto those or at least as much of them as possibl   howev  we want to keep our option open for august  and we don   t want to generat in the market a fear that we are complet focus on inflat with no regard for output  the other part of our mandat   it   s a delic balanc act to show that we are awar of the inflat situat but that we are not singl mind focus on the inflat situat   the statement is design to show that we are cogniz of the inflat risk   we take note of the elev read   we mention that inflat risk remain   we also note  howev  that output is moder and give some reason for that  and we say in section   that the moder in output will reduc some of the pressur   obvious there   s disagr about how flat the phillip curv is  but all els be equal  that will be a factor  respond to governor bie    suggest  i think put that first sentenc of section   into the rational in section   is more logic  but the way section   is structur  first it say     here are the thing that are slow inflat     and then it say     but here   s what we   re worri about      so if we put it there  it will downgrad it somehow  if we put it in section    it will say that we are awar of the output risk   there   s also perhap a subtleti in section   that the firm will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth   that   s actual an adapt of a suggest that presid   made  and what it    i hope  is indic that we   re look at both variabl as we make our decis  so i   m hope that this statement will strike the balanc between convey our vigil  convey our concern  maintain our credibl gain  and remov the notion from the market that we are certain we will move in august or that we will pursu inflat singl mind at a rapid rate and independ of whatev happen on the real side of the economi  again  with respect to some of the suggest that were made  i think they   re all veri interest   presid pool made a veri interest case   i don   t think there   s a consensus for go to the restrict languag right now   howev reason it may be in principl to use the first sentenc in altern c  section    or to say that read are unwelcom  i fear it will tip the balanc toward a higher probabl in august  perhap this nuanc is too fine  but i am concern about the effect on the market of perceiv the fed as too aggress   there is a new chairman  they don   t know me   as far as they know  i am an inflat nutter  and i want to make sure that they understand that output is one of our concern  those were the main point i want to make   governor bie suggest strike the last phrase in altern b  section     i don   t feel strong about that     anyon have a view on that   vice chairman
i guess i don   t have ani concern with do it  except that i wouldn   t know how to answer a question about whi we took it out of the formul after have it in for some  e   everi chang we make to the statement has to meet that test  and i   m not sure how i would explain it  although i think i agre with you  governor bie  about the reason for it   but i just don   t think the benefit of do it offset the need for explan
i was just suggest a chang owe to comment from some of the folk tri to interpret us   whenev a piec of data come out  the market react  and that reaction is part of the volatil   to the extent that the data are anticip  they are implicit in our forecast  and we don   t want to impli that everi piec of news chang that   i was just tri to respond to those comment
let me say that i hope in my monetari polici tes oni to talk a bit about our framework  our focus on the forecast and on the outlook  and the fact that we will not ever respond to ani individu number   i would be quit happi to receiv ani suggest that member might have about how to explain these issu   we   ll be work on that over the next coupl of week   presid pianalto  did you have a comment
well  just a comment that we   ve chang    impli    to    determin      is there suppos to be a differ   again  it   s a nuanc  but will peopl focus on that chang of word   is    determin    stronger than    impli      that   s all
yes   it   s valid to chang the word back to    impli
that would be fine   good point  sandi
veri good   presid
i just want to clarifi the point that governor bie and i were make   we were suggest that we move the first half of the sentenc in number    the claus    although the moder in growth of aggreg demand should help to limit inflat pressur over  e     up to the rational part   in the last sentenc of section    you could remov the word    howev    and just put that phrase right at the begin of the sentenc   i think the result still would have the same continu that you want to see in the rational section  and i think it   s more of a rational point than an assess of risk point
it is  but logic you would have to say    ongo product gain have held down the rise in unit labor cost  inflat expect remain contain  and the moder of the growth of aggreg demand would help to moder      then you say    howev     signal that these are the thing that we are realli worri about   resourc util and price of energi   the sentenc as it stand signal to me that all these thing are work to constrain inflat  but we are more concern about resourc util and commod price becaus we put them at the end of the sentenc  at the end of the paragraph  give them the greater emphasi   i think that put this claus where it is convey somewhat greater attent to aggreg demand as a new element in think about the inflat outlook relat to our think at the last meet   i realiz that it   s a subtl issu of emphasi  and as i said  i don   t think this statement is a work of art
of cours  i understand the logic  but if you do put it in section    as presid   said  it has a tendenc to stay there   we have to see what it would look like in futur meet as well   if you then take it out  you have to question whi you are do so
well  i think the risk assess is go to chang   we just chang the risk assess from    further polici firm may be need    to    risk remain      so i think that structur is somewhat more fluid than the other part   governor kohn
i was go to make the point presid pianalto made
good   i would like to put the recommend on the tabl for    basi point and altern b as modifi by the one word    impli      you can take care of that later  michell   do you have it to distribut   you   ve distribut it alreadi
we can insert it
fine   could you pleas call the roll
i   ll be read the direct word from page    of the bluebook and the assess of risk from the tabl that was hand out with     s brief     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     and    although the moder in the growth of aggreg demand should help to limit inflat pressur over  e  the committe judg that some inflat risk remain   the extent and  e of ani addit firm that may be need to address these risk will depend on the evolut of the outlook for both inflat and econom growth as impli by incom inform   in ani event  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to support the attain of it object     chairman bernank  vice chairman   governor bie   presid guynn  governor kohn  governor   presid     presid pianalto  governor   presid     yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
thank you   we have two veri short item   we can perhap do those  finish the meet  and then have our coffe   but first  we   ll be right back    laughter   recess
all right   sorri for that interrupt   we have a report now from the subcommitte on communic   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i distribut a memo earlier this week  a report from our communic with you about how you would like to proceed go forward   the main thing i   d like to do is hear whether there   s ani reaction to that report  veri tentat  our idea was to cover goal  broad strategi  and philosophi in august   a number of peopl thought it would be a good idea to start with that   it might provid a framework for further consider   then we would move on to the numer definit of price stabil in our two day meet in octob  which   will talk about in a few minut   most peopl want to start with the numer definit of price stabil  both becaus it would influenc a lot of what els would happen and becaus it reflect on the discuss we   ve just been have   it   s relev to the way we approach our monetari polici right now and in the immedi futur   it will certain influenc some of the discuss we have about what the announc should say   so a number of reason were given for start with that  and we propos to do it at the octob meet     anybodi have ani reaction   cathi
i certain think that at the august discuss we need to settl on the polici  the under goal  and all of that   i  for one  am look forward to an octob discuss of inflat target about as much as i would be look forward to a root canal    laughter   i would be happi to put it off for a standard two day meet in januari   i know i   m in a minor on this one  but i just want to regist how much i   m look forward to this    laughter
root canal save teeth that otherwis would be lost   no gain without pain
you could skip it   you could stay home
there   s anoth way to avoid that  i can tell you    laughter
ani other comment or suggest about these sort of near term path  hear none  we   ll do that   from talk with my fellow member of the subcommitte  i   m not sure that there   s much background materi we could provid for the august meet   that will be a sort of broad philosoph discuss   if we think of someth  we will let you know  or if you folk think of someth that would be help  pleas let us know  for the octob meet  i   ll ask the staff to redistribut the materi that was distribut in januari         it was a veri complet studi of some of the issu involv   we have a number of new member  and some of us haven   t look at it in a long  e   after review that materi  if we think there is some updat or some further work that need to be done to inform that octob discuss  we ought to proceed from that base   so i   ll ask the secretari to distribut the studi soon and then ask peopl to get back to me if they see someth els they think need to be done befor octob   thank you  mr  chairman
what   that actual mean we are go to do in august   are we go to have an existenti convers without fact  just a sort of general discuss about convict
sever peopl thought that defin the goal would help structur the rest of the discuss  and they also had some philosoph point they want to make   this goe to your existenti point  perhap  about the best general  broad  strateg way of accomplish those goal  i think it would be use  and a lot of peopl thought it would be use   at least it might not be a long discuss  and we are tri to do it by extend the afternoon   that might shorten it   laughter   we do not have to spend a lot of  e  but i think that  if there are issu to get on the tabl  it would be nice to get them on the tabl at the begin of the discuss   presid
i know i   m talk too much at this meet  but with regard to august  i think it   s also import   and this was the last item on your outlin   to consid communic in a broad context  not in the narrow context of the statement   we communic in a lot of differ way  and i think we need to recogn that in a deeper way than we have in the past
that is certain the intent of the subcommitte   all right  thank you veri much   ms
just to follow up on the memo that was distribut summar the result of the survey on meet format  that survey reveal a number of area of clear agreement   the recent format with the separ go round on the economi and polici is view as a good one  and there   s littl appetit for substanti chang to the format at least for now  but more give and take dure the meet would still be welcom by most   also  special topic are overwhelm consid a good use of  e  with strong sen ent for use staff from both the board and the bank as well as for allow enough lead  e for ampl preparatori work   final  there appear to be widespread sen ent for lengthen the amount of meet  e  but opinion are split about whether two day meet are the best way to accomplish this   on this last point  the survey result and subsequ consult suggest that a consensus could probabl be reach around a steadi state of  say  four two day meet each year   these four would consist of two meet with special topic  two was  in fact  the modal respons to the survey question on that  and then two meet befor the chairman   s semiannu tes oni to allow a more in depth discuss of the economi and the outlook with the lead in of the chart show   for       we are think of a baselin of two day meet in januari and june  as those preced the tes oni  as well as two day meet in perhap march and octob for tradit style special topic present   whenev possibl  we would schedul those two day meet on tuesday and wednesday sinc that was the day of the week option that appear least distast to you in the aggreg    laughter   now  come back to the nearer term  as governor kohn note  communic issu are like to requir signific addit meet  e befor the end of this year  includ perhap a coupl of two day meet   therefor  we would like to add  e to the august meet both by begin a bit earlier and by extend into the afternoon as much as need   as long as the polici decis has been complet  the announc could be releas as usual at      in the afternoon  even while the meet remain in session   in addit  we would propos to expand both the octob and the decemb meet to two day to accommod the communic topic  discuss on this topic are  of cours  expect to spill over into next year as well  but for now we are not propos addit two day meet for that purpos   depend upon how the extend one day meet in august goe and how the communic agenda itself progress  there would be various option for set asid meet  e next year for those discuss   so  go forward  if you are broad in agreement with this approach to the schedul  we will be send to your offic in the next coupl of day a propos calendar of meet date for the remaind of      and through        we would request  if possibl  a relat prompt turnaround on identifi signific calendar conflict becaus we   re receiv numer inquiri about next year   s meet date  which would typic have been releas by this point   also  as to the special topic  we plan to survey you later this year to see what special topic would be of interest for the slot next year   so if you have ani specif suggest to make  pleas let   or me know befor then   then onc the topic are chosen  we propos to use the system research advisori committe to organ the work  with perhap board staff lead one special topic effort and bank staff lead the other   final  thank you also for the addit comment mani of you provid on the survey   they will be use go forward
