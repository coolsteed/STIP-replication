thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart circul a short  e ago   dure the intermeet period  asset price trade larg in the rang we have seen for most of the year  though certain trend were maintain  particular the continu flatten of the yield curv  the narrow of spread  and the depreci of the dollar against some of the major currenc   until friday   s surpris strong employ data  market particip had focus more on sign of a slowdown in growth   the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix      the top panel on the first page graph the three month deposit

some in the market are interpret this flatten as reassur that inflationari concern are contain   interest  despit the flatten of the curv  tip breakeven rate have widen sinc the septemb meet   as shown in the top left panel of the next page  ten year breakeven rate widen about   percentag point   part of the recent widen may have been due to the last cpi report  which rose     point   tip  as you know  use the non season adjust consum price index to determin inflat compens  that make the latest widen a bit of a puzzl sinc the recent declin in oil price may reason be expect to have a damp effect on upcom cpi report   inde  to add to the puzzl  some have link the recent widen of breakeven spread to the recent fall in oil price on the theori that this is s ul to growth and later for

spread  shown in the middl right panel  are also at multiyear low   while some of the narrow is  no doubt  the result of a search for yield by some investor  the strong cash posit of the corpor sector

balanc competit issu vis  vis china against the inflationari impact on their own economi of continu to interven in foreign exchang market   the balanc may have shift back somewhat overnight in south korea  which report interven aggress to prevent a further rise of the won   market particip es  that the intervent was between      million and    billion   other asian currenc depreci modest as well   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper by the desk in the period   if you agre  i suggest that we paus for ani question and approv of the domest oper   then i could say a few word about the memo that   and i circul last week about the desk   s domest oper
whi don   t you do that
shall we do that now
yes  whi don   t you get it out of the way
okay  fine   at the last meet  the committe ask   and me to be a    committe of two    to review how the desk oper dure a period when the market strong expect the committe to chang the target fed fund rate   i should say that most of the work was conduct by spenc hilton  who is sit to my left  and by jim clous from the board   s staff  who is also here today   i won   t repeat everyth that   s in the memo  which i think speak for itself  but i   ll summar our primari conclus   first  we found that the volatil of the fed fund rate   not seem to correl with ani major asset class   therefor  to the extent that there is volatil in this narrow sector  it has no observ advers spillov effect   we also believ that over  e the desk has the tool to deal with such circumst   inde  we think we learn someth from the august experi that help us manag the fund rate around the septemb fomc meet   and over  e  as both the desk and bank reserv manag adapt to the new environ  i would expect this type of volatil to dissip  if the committe did wish to chang the regim  the choic fall in two categori   first  fomc meet date could conscious be align to coincid with the end of the reserv mainten period   a variat would be for polici chang to take effect in the next reserv period   a second possibl would involv publish reserv forecast   both of these regim chang option have some disadvantag  and the solut themselv may creat new problem  thus  at the risk of seem to push for the status quo  our recommend is to maintain the current oper framework      i don   t know if you have anyth to add
let me just say up front  sinc i was the one who rais the issu origin  that i thought you review it quit effect  and i person concur with the posit that you   ve come to  with respect to the tip ten year rate  the oil price has had a veri unusu effect on it over the year  and one of the reason is that the spread of the crude oil seven year futur has behav rather differ relat to the spot price in recent year than it had previous   sinc the spread between light sweet crude price  for which the wti is the best measur  and gasolin and home heat oil price is reason flat  can   t we take the forward wti price  convert it into a gasolin and home heat oil price and subtract that from the cpi   with the cpi weight   to get effect a judgment as to what core rate is impli in the cpi  presum that the food compon is averag   that get around the question of tri to answer to what extent the recent oil price affect the forecast of the cpi that is embodi in the tip yield   is that someth you can do readili
i know i haven   t done it
it   s someth that we regular do  mr  chairman
you take the long term forecast
we take the structur of wti futur rate  use the   percent weight in the overal cpi and appli it to the non season adjust figur  and then subtract off to get a measur of the core
you don   t take the crude price   you take the crude plus markup  i assum   is that what you   re say
in that context  how would this veri latest run up sinc the end of octob look
well  one thing i would note is that becaus of the backward of the futur curv  it   s in fact
it   s lower  but it   s less lower than
yes   so you have the two effect   you have the spot effect of the whole futur curv shift up  which give you the immedi increas in inflat compens  but you also have the forecast subsequ declin  which actual subtract from it
and becaus the spot price have move so dramat  though the spread have not chang all that much  there has been a signific close of the percentag gap in price even though the absolut gap has open up
i was curious how all that turn out becaus it   s pretti evid that the ten year tip compens is give us a quit signific differ read  and it would be use to know whether or not it   s mere a statist issu   with one base on core inflat and the other base on the total cpi   or if there   s someth more deep seat there
i would make two observ   one is that i haven   t actual seen the  e seri   my recollect is that it   s onli a coupl of point in the intermeet period   it   s not a larg number   on the order of    to    basi point   the second point is that five to ten year forward inflat compens is actual lower   so this is someth that happen in the first five year of the term structur of inflat compens   but we can do this adjust for you in the  e seri perspect
it   s terribl import for us to get judgment on what the tip is show   we can alway talk about it liquid or say that it   s x or y   some day we   ll look back and say that the tip market was give us signal and we had too mani excus as to whi we weren   t look at it
when we look at these special factor  which includ the smaller than  expect auction and the chang in oil futur price  it realli is hard to get those special factor as a larg compon in the pars   it   s on the order of    basi point out of the    basi point rise
i think that   s use to know
we took some consol from the fact that the five to ten year forward inflat compens realli just move sideway   and the ten year forward rate  given the flatten in the term structur that dino note  basic also move sideway
question for dino either on the present or on   and dino   s conclus with respect to the discuss we had last  e   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i complet agre with dino   s conclus and your assent that what we   ve been do in the conduct of open market oper is about right  the desk is protest enough to make it clear that dino isn   t prejudg the outcom of the fomc meet but is tri to keep reserv from get so overabund that we have a lot of volatil later   as for chang meet date  i know from have sat in     s chair that there are a lot of factor vector in on the choic of meet date  and i don   t think we need to have one more   thing are work just fine  i have a comment  rather than a question  on anoth thing that dino said   dino  you note that fed commentari on the current account deficit was a factor in the weak of the dollar   my percept was that it was more than just commentari on the current account deficit   there was a sens in the market anyhow that the commentari was lean toward tri to talk down the dollar   that the fed was engag in action or word design to drive the dollar lower   i   m a littl concern about that percept   i agre that we can   t avoid talk about the current account deficit   it   s a huge imbal in our economi  and how it resolv will great affect how we run monetari polici in the futur   and i also agre that a lower dollar some   somewher in the futur is probabl part of that correct process  but i do think we need to be cautious about make statement that are perceiv as talk down the dollar   comment on the dollar is the job of the treasuri depart   i think that divis of respons has been use to us  as you   ve note mani  e  mr  chairman  we   re not veri good at predict where the dollar is go or is like to be   even if it has to go lower over the long term  the lord onli know where it   s go to be in the short and intermedi term   and there   s not much we can do through monetari polici about the current account deficit   it   s more a fiscal polici issu   we   ll have to react to develop as they occur   the dollar is alreadi under downward pressur   i think it will fall of it own weight   the odd on a disord declin are veri  veri low  but they   re not zero  and i think we need to be rather cautious in that regard move forward   treasuri depart and bond market peopl in talk to me note that there had been feedback from the market that somehow the fed and the treasuri were at odd on what dollar polici was   i don   t believ that   s a product way to go in a veri tender market   so  while i don   t think we can avoid talk about the current account deficit  i think we need to be especi cautious at this point in the dollar cycl
let   s stay on the subject   are you on this subject
yes  i was go to stay on this subject   it   s alway a pleasur to echo don  i don   t know that i fulli intern fed doctrin on imbal and exchang rate polici and thing like that  but let me just say someth from the perspect of my previous life   i alway had the sens sit there in my posit at the treasuri that u s  policymak should alway be care not to convey the sens that they actual know the desir direct for the dollar and that they should not in ani way suggest that they were go to tri to induc that move   i think that   s true in general  but it   s much more import when we   re talk about a prospect declin   onc establish  the sens that a declin is desir is veri hard to revers  and it make it veri hard to manag the risk of a more acut declin caus broader collater damag to asset price  so i just want to make the obvious point   even if we   re veri care and even if we allud onli veri general and indirect to our concern about the size of the imbal and their unsustain   and that an adjust in relat price like has to come as part of the unwind   i think our muse in public will make it harder for the administr to disciplin it own rank  which is alway a formid challeng  let me also echo the conclus of the committe of two   i thought the analysi was nice frame and did a good job of look at the altern   and those altern met that critic test  which was to illustr whi they were not particular compel against the regim in which we oper now
let me just say that we have a veri delic problem to deal with   be involv with monetari polici and  inde  by tie monetari polici as we do to the global environ  we can   t make believ that the current account deficit is irrelev   and we can   t basic argu that it will essenti adjust without market forc be critic involv  yet there is no question that we have to avoid convey the percept that we are essenti talk the dollar down becaus we think that   s what would be requir to adjust the imbal  it   s a veri t i issu  i have a tough problem becaus i was invit by jean claud trichet to appear on a european panel some  late next week   and the subject matter is the euro   now  i could get around the issu veri readili in my prepar remark  but there is a forti minut q a period with a panel of onli jean claud  me  and one of the vice governor of the bank of japan   so i   m in the process of write a speech in which i replic to some extent what i   ve said befor on the current account balanc   where it   s come from  what the issu are  and essenti argu at the end that there is signific evid that high current account deficit of develop countri have in virtual all case adjust without crisi   what i don   t usual say is that invari a signific element in that adjust is a declin in the real exchang rate  now  i   m tri to put togeth someth that re emphas what i   ve said befor   which is accur as best we can judg   and that is that the inabl to forecast exchang rate in the intermedi period is an extraordinarili robust statist conclus   inde  one can find all sort of exampl where everybodi is project that a currenc will move in one direct and it goe in the other   i intend to put enough discuss of that in my statement to indic that there is no short term issu here with respect to the dollar   and i plan to talk as well about the fundament question that  as a practic matter  get down to the govern deficit   and that   s it  we have evid veri poor capabl of address privat save   we   ve tri everyth under the sun   some of it work better than other   none of it obvious work veri well  if you just look at the straight downward trend in the household save rate   so i think what i   m go to tri to do  and i hope that the rest of you will tri to do so  is to emphas the one area where it will matter  which is fiscal polici   and i think that we can have some effect   there is a grow awar in the administr that this issu realli has to be address and that it requir a signific turnaround in what has been go on in recent year   i think there is a recognit that that has to be done   if we are out there encourag that  which we of cours have been do general for quit a long period of  e  i think that could be a posit forc  i would scarc say to you      don   t discuss the current account deficit      that   s like not talk about the crazi aunt in the closet   you have no choic   it is an element of signific in the outlook  and the forc that are drive it one way or the other are thing we have discuss over  e   but the one thing we have to tri to avoid  to the extent that we can possibl do so  is to impli that an immin declin in the exchang rate is in front of us   if we do that  then observ will presum that there is either some general offici view about that on the part of the fomc or that individu  without an offici posit  we all believ the same thing   and the credibl of the fomc  which we take great pride in  will work against us   everyon will presum  irrespect of their own view  that we understand the market  and they will behav accord   and that could creat some fair signific problem for stabil   so we now have three subject on the tabl   would anybodi els like to comment
could i ask   a question
sure  by all mean
i have a question on whether we   re see a chang in emerg asia in exchang rate polici and practic   i   m curious about whether you think there   s a common factor behind it in the follow sens   do we see across these countri a signific chang in under inflat that has caus them to decid that they want more independ in monetari polici   or are we see someth that is more idiosyncrat  with differ set of forc at work
well  as i will repeat in just a minut  i   m afraid  emerg asia actual is fare compar less well than the other region of the world at the moment on two score  higher oil price and a percept that at least for a  e there   s a bit of a paus in the strength of the high tech sector   and these countri see themselv vulner to the fact that they import more primari product than anybodi els in some sens   few of them have primari product resourc domest   so the inflat consequ of develop over the last few month have loom larger for them than for other  and i think in that sens they are reassess how unfortun an exchang rate appreci would be for them   at the same  e  their real perform is impair as well  so there   s sort of a juggl act involv  as with ani negat suppli shock   but i think see that they are more vulner than most has alter a bit the calculus of how import it is to stabil the exchang rate vis  vis each other and vis  vis the renminbi   and they probabl are more vulner than china  if that   s the eleph in the room  becaus china is a much larger and much more close economi and it is domest abl to deal with some of these issu better than the smaller satellit emerg asian countri are
further question for dino or
mr  chairman  do we need to move approv of the domest oper
yes  let   s first move approv of the desk   s domest oper   would somebodi like to do so  speaker      yes   i so move
without object  they are approv   now  we   ve had three comment on the memo that was circul and that dino has discuss   unless i hear signific negat  i will assum that those three    vote    so to speak captur the consensus of the group   so if ani you would disagre with the recommend of dino and    pleas speak up   or if anyon wish to add someth relev to their conclus that reinforc it  speak up    laughter
other than good job
i guess you win on both count   we will move on then to     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   i suspect that for mani current and former new england  the stir victori of the boston red sox last month gave hope to other long defer dream   in my case  i muse that if the red sox could come from behind to beat the yanke and then sweep the world seri  wasn   t it possibl for the staff one day to get the near term employ forecast right   laughter   ala  while the dream live on  the realiti of last friday   s employ report left me feel a lot more like bill buckner than manni ramirez   as you know  through the summer and into the fall we had dog held to our forecast that a pickup in employ growth was immin   but after four consecut sizabl disappoint that left report gain in privat payrol averag just        per month sinc may  our septemb project call for an immedi acceler to increas averag         per month seem a stretch to us this  e around   as a concess to these develop  we mark down our project for privat payrol gain in the novemb  book to about         per month in the current quarter and delay ani meaning acceler of employ until late winter   then last friday  as the ball dribbl between our leg and roll into right field  the bls report that  well  the labor market had not been so weak after all   privat payrol increas         in octob  and the level of privat employ in septemb had been revis up          to be sure  the jump in hire last month got a consider boost from construct employ  which was like relat in part to rebuild effort in the aftermath of the hurrican   and none of the labor market indic that we monitor would suggest take october= gain of near         as the present hire trend   but the current es  averag gain of about         per month over the past three month   not seem an unreason es  of the under pace of privat employ growth   iron  that is pretti close to our forecast back in the septemb  book   while recent experi reinforc  yet again  the caution with which one should approach these es   the averag job gain now report to have occur in recent month do fit more easili with other indic suggest that a moder improv in labor market condit is under way   initi claim for unemploy insur have been move sideway at a level consist with the somewhat larger employ increas now report  the number of individu exhaust their unemploy insur has continu to fall in recent month  and survey of hire intent have  for the most part  move up   as you know from read the  book  the weak employ situat was one of the key factor behind our downward revis to real gdp growth over the next coupl of quarter   we view the meager employ gain and the associ shortfal in labor incom as like to be a drag on consum spend late this year and into the next   obvious  the octob employ report suggest that this drag will now be smaller than we had anticip   but we had other reason as well for trim our near term gdp forecast  includ weaker read on industri product  a further jump in non auto inventori invest last quarter  and consider higher oil price over the project period   and these factor  for the most part  still argu for a somewhat weaker outlook than we had project in septemb   although the data in hand suggest that manufactur ip will bounc back from a hurrican depress declin in septemb  the averag gain in recent month have been to the low side of our expect   the recent soft has been most pronounc in the high tech sector but has extend elsewher as well   we are now project factori output to increas    percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter  near   percentag point less than in our septemb project   some of the slow that we have observ in industri product could have result from a diminish impetus to output from effort by busi to rebuild previous deplet stock   inde  that impetus appear larg to be behind us   the level of non auto inventori invest last quarter is es  to have been much higher than we anticip in septemb  and a drop off in inventori invest is expect to subtract about   percentag point from the growth of real gdp in the current quarter   final  we again had to contend with higher oil price in this forecast   last wednesday  as the  book went to bed  the spot price of west texa intermedi crude oil was expect to be about    per barrel higher on averag over the project period than in the septemb  book  and the price of import oil was project to averag about    per barrel abov our previous project   price have come down notic over the past week   but the price of wti is still about    per barrel abov our septemb  book project  and the price of import oil is es  to be about    per barrel higher   those higher price are take anoth bite out of household incom and are like to restrain spend somewhat in come month   put this all togeth  the event of the past week would lead us to mark up somewhat our novemb project for the growth in real gdp over the next coupl of quarter to a pace just shi of that which we project in septemb     will discuss this morn   s trade data short  but it look as though those data would caus us to rais our es  of third quarter growth to around    percent at an annual rate   moreov  given stronger employ and lower oil price  we would be inclin to revis up our project for the growth in real gdp in the current quarter from the     percent figur in the novemb  book to someth closer to   percent and to revis up the first quarter of next year from   percent to about     percent   these adjust would probabl add a tenth or so to growth in each of      and        to be frank  after the larg downward revis that we made to the project at midyear  subsequ adjust have been relat minor   dure this period  the economi has  for the most part  appear to us to be grow at or modest abov trend   and the prospect seem favor for a continu of that perform   to be sure  fiscal polici is project to shift from provid consider s ulus to the growth of real output this year to be a rough neutral factor next year   but monetari polici  at least by our reckon  will remain reason accommod over the project period   and the restraint be exert on the economi by the run up in energi price this year should begin to fade next year as price first stabil and then declin   we continu to see some import risk to this admit benign outlook   even with the declin in recent day  by virtual ani metric the jump in crude oil and other energi price this year constitut a larg shock   in the past  most especi in the     s and earli     s  oil price shock were accompani by an unusu degre of restraint on household spend  which is to say that standard linear model seem  on balanc  to underst the weak in spend in these episod   despit this evid  we did not build ani appreci nonlinear effect into the project   we suspect that the effect of oil price shock on sen ent and spend in the      s and      s were amplifi by a regulatori environ that result in shortag  gas line  and disrupt that creat a great deal more econom uncertainti than household and busi are now cope with   moreov  we haven   t yet detect in either the spend data or read on consum sen ent ani outsiz respons to this year   s oil shock   still  it   s probabl prematur to be confid that such effect will not manifest themselv at some point in the current episod   anoth downsid risk is that high tech equip spend is on a weaker long term trajectori than incorpor in the baselin   third quarter spend on comput and softwar was well below our earlier expect  and the news continu to suggest that spend on tech equip has remain lacklust   we have weaken this element of our project through the first quarter of next year  but then we are project a reacceler of these outlay back closer to histor norm   the recent soft combin with smaller declin in the relat price of high tech capit good over the past year or so could be signal that the pace of technic progress and the imper to invest in this type of equip is wane  we believ that it is too soon to draw that conclus  but this possibl   constitut some downsid risk to our project   the risk in the outlook for capit spend  howev  are not one side   outsid of high tech  equip spend has been grow brisk   we have continu to interpret some of this strength in spend as be s ul by the partial expens provis   with the bulk of that s ulus schedul to expir at the end of this year  we are anticip a drop in equip outlay in the first quarter and some small restraint on spend in subsequ quarter   but as we have note on numer occas  our calibr of the magnitud of this effect is base more on educ guesswork than on hard scienc   if the effect has been smaller than we current es   then under demand has been correspond stronger  and henc there could be greater momentum to equip spend as we enter next year   anoth key upsid risk that we have been point to for some  e remain that the veri low level of real interest rate assum in our project will spark a sharp acceler in activ or inflat   two obvious channel through which that could occur are the stock market and the exchang valu of the dollar   for both of these element of the forecast  we employ someth akin to a random walk with drift   we project the stock market to rise in line with the risk adjust yield on bond  and we project the dollar to fall onli slight from current level   the shallow trajectori that we have assum for the feder fund rate could  of cours  provok a steeper rise in the stock market or a larger fall in the dollar than incorpor in the baselin forecast  and by enough to matter   for exampl  if we were to assum that the dollar resum declin at the averag annual rate observ between it peak in      and earli this year   about   percent   rather than the     percent annual rate declin that we are project  a simul of frb us suggest that the accompani impetus to demand would caus output to overshoot potenti and inflat to edg higher by        in respons to that outcom  a taylor rule would prescrib a path for the fund rate about    basi point higher than in our baselin in      and about    basi point higher in        a path for the fund rate similar to that current built into futur market   certain  such an outcom seem well within the realm of possibl   turn to inflat  our project has chang relat littl over the intermeet period   increas in the core cpi for august and septemb were  on net  a bit higher than we had been project   but much of our miss was in price for use car and lodg away from home  and we did not attach much signal to these develop   inde  core pce price have actual been run a bit below expect  though again not by enough for us to alter our basic outlook   meanwhil  the recent read on hour labor compens have surpris us to the downsid  figur on comp per hour from the eci and from the nipa base compens measur both came in at about     percent at an annual rate in the third quarter  about    percentag point less than in our previous project   there realli has been no discern trend in compens inflat over the past coupl of year   of cours  the biggest news on the price front has been the run up in oil price that i mention earlier   higher energi price are project to boost headlin cpi to about    percent at an annual rate in the current quarter  about   percentag point abov the septemb forecast   the indirect effect of these higher energi price are expect to add anoth tenth or so to core consum price inflat over the next few quarter   it is our sens that higher price for oil  other commod  and import are continu to feed through into core consum price   go forward  our expect is that energi price will edg down  commod price will level off  and the increas in import price will slow   these develop are anticip to place downward pressur on core consum price next year   but in our forecast  these benefici develop are larg offset by the diminish margin of slack in resourc util and by some upward pressur on cost associ with a slow of structur labor product dure the next two year   both the pluse and minus are relat small here  and we are anticip core pce inflat to move about sideway at it current annual pace of about     percent   let me conclud with a brief thought on the uncertainti in the outlook  obvious the list of risk remain long   there is much we don   t understand about whi the economi has fail to show even greater vigor in respons to massiv fiscal s ulus and veri low real interest rate   more broad  geopolit risk and the threat of terror are almost certain to be perman featur of the econom landscap  and some veri daunt long term challeng   most notabl  those associ with larg budget deficit  low household save  and a widen current account deficit   are alway a threat to cascad back into the present in unpleas way   but on the posit side  those risk now seem to be confront an economi that is fundament less fragil than it has been at mani point in the past four year    will continu our present
over the intermeet period  news about foreign econom develop has general been somewhat disappoint  and we have edg down our outlook for real gdp growth abroad in respons   the downward revis is largest for the third quarter      percentag point  as growth appear to have been below our expect in japan  europ  and emerg asia other than china  where we were surpris on the upsid as we were also to a slight extent in latin america  for the current quarter and the rest of the forecast period  we have taken an averag     percentag point off the annual rate of foreign growth   a major factor behind our decis to shave a bit off prospect growth abroad has been the intermeet behavior of oil price   although the sharp run up in spot wti price attract much attent  that price signific retrac it gain in the final two week of the period   howev  the far futur price for wti rose on balanc    per barrel over the period   accord  the entir path of oil futur price shift up   to some extent  the elev wti price reflect the premium now be paid for sweet  less sulfur  crude oil relat to other grade of oil  and we anticip that this premium will narrow over  e as the suppli of sweet oil from the gulf of mexico is fulli restor  refin shift their capac  and demand adjust   howev  consist with the futur market  we now project that oil price will be higher for longer than we thought in septemb  as continu product at current high rate seem less certain and as demand remain strong   for the industri countri  small negat revis to the outlook were widespread as elev oil price have erod confid to some extent and weaken domest demand   in canada  an oil export  growth has remain strong although we mark down the forecast a bit in respons to chang in the u s  forecast   for emerg market economi in asia  the prospect of sustain  elev oil price has more negat consequ than is the case for latin american countri   the asian emerg market economi general import oil and other primari commod   higher global price for these good plus a somewhat dimmer outlook for the high tech sector have led us to becom less op ist about these countri  on averag   in contrast  activ so far in      has been strong in latin america  as primari product export and energi self suffici   or better   have boost growth  we nonetheless revis our outlook down slight in         we expect that foreign econom activ is rebound in the current quarter from the slow that was evid in the preced three month  particular in japan  the unit kingdom  and emerg asia   but we look for averag growth abroad to weaken a bit over the next two year   in part  this project reflect the need for some of the rapid grow foreign economi  such as canada and the unit kingdom  to bring growth in line with potenti   monetari polici has alreadi been tighten in both these countri  and we expect addit move in canada   in addit  we look for growth in china to moder as offici there use both administr and interest rate tool to slow credit creation and the expans of invest spend  in particular   the subdu outlook for growth abroad also reflect the depreci of the dollar that occur over the intermeet period and the further depreci that we have again incorpor into the forecast   sinc septemb  the exchang valu of the dollar has fallen sharpli against mani of the other major currenc   in respons  we have lower the project path for the real valu of the broad index of the dollar about   percent   currenc appreci should be a factor restrain growth over the forecast period in the other industri countri   in our  book baselin  the combin effect of higher oil price  the lower dollar  and revis to output growth here and abroad is a slight eas in the project drag from real net export in this quarter and dure the next two year  this quarter and for the first half of      we see the extern sector as have a larg neutral effect on gdp growth  as import are restrain by moder u s  growth and export bounc back   thereaft  the negat arithmet contribut of net export is about    percentag point  as relat strong u s  growth boost real import while dollar depreci work to lessen the gap between real export and real import   nevertheless  the nomin u s  current account deficit is expect to widen to near      billion in the fourth quarter of       about    percent of gdp  this deficit reflect a higher oil import bill throughout the forecast period than previous project  with the overal trade deficit widen about     billion at an annual rate from the current quarter to the end of        in addit  the deficit on net invest incom is project to widen by a compar amount as rise u s  interest rate and the grow stock of u s  portfolio liabil combin to overwhelm a modest increas in net receipt from direct invest here and abroad   this morn  we receiv data on trade in septemb   the trade deficit  at       billion  was notic narrow than we and the market had anticip  contrari to our expect for a rise  merchandis import edg down  with most of the surpris concentr in core good   in contrast  export came in stronger than expect  again with most of the miss in core good   of note  the surpris weak in export in august was revis into a respect gain   on balanc  this morning= data indic that real net export made a negat contribut to u s  gdp growth of     percentag point in the third quarter  consider smaller than the minus     percentag point in the novemb  book   this revis is pretti even split between higher export and lower import   although it is a bit earli to draw implic of these data for the current quarter  we remain fair comfort with our  book project   dave and i would be happi to answer ani question
question for our colleagu   presid pool
there are two theme in your discuss that i   d like you to comment on a bit more to tri to reconcil them   on the one hand  you say that the increas in energi price in the last year to year and a half has been driven primarili by increas in worldwid demand   then on the other hand  you say that the price increas we   ve seen is a reason to mark down forecast of demand   so  it   s a question realli of whether the demand curv is shift   and price are high becaus the whole demand curv has shift out as a consequ of higher growth   or whether we   re slide along the demand curv
i guess we   re learn as we go along the consequ of have global demand push on resourc limit the way it has been   and we are make adjust of a tenth here and a tenth there   so  it   s not as if analyt my demand curv are well enough defin that i can even tell the differ between move along a curv versus the curv shift at this point   i think down deep that strong demand is the central factor in explain whi oil price in particular  but commod price more broad  have been high   there is a self limit natur to the price adjust process that occur  but it   s hard to say that those higher price are then a caus for weaker growth   it is just a matter of both growth and price be resolv in the marketplac  but i think that recent event  particular the event in the past intermeet period  have convey an awar that the suppli condit that this higher demand is confront are a bit less robust and a littl less certain than peopl previous thought   in the energi case  this mix between sweet and sour oil sudden seem more import   wherea we often talk   i myself did   about total product versus total consumpt and question where the miss barrel were and so forth  now we need to think about the possibl that the import issu may not be just total product but the composit of product and the composit of refineri capac  so it may be that the element of demand in the differ economi are go to determin how this work out   we   ve learn  for exampl  that hurrican in the gulf of mexico have a much greater potenti to disrupt suppli than we understood to have been the case    so i think this extra uncertainti and the somewhat greater volatil and risk on the suppli side are lead me in an expect valu sens to say that the outcom of these demand pressur and what i know about suppli may involv a littl less growth than i had previous thought
i had a question on the auto outlook   the peopl that we talk to in the industri are rather conserv about the outlook for next year   they   re expect relat flat sale   now  they   re not alway right  of cours   but the  book has sale go up   percent next year to a record level and then go up anoth   percent in        i was wonder if you could comment on the rational for that and how it compar with the more conserv forecast that we   re hear from those in the auto industri
well  our project is certain abov those forecast  as you point out  certain one featur of our stronger outlook for motor vehicl is that we have lower interest rate   and notic lower interest rate   than are current built into market expect   so the financ environ that we think is go to prevail is quit favor   anoth factor is that we   re still a littl more op ist on longer term potenti output growth than the consensus forecast   so in some sens we think there   s go to be greater wherewith to purchas motor vehicl   now  whether we have it right in term of how that split up between the number of unit produc and the valu per unit could certain be open to some question   but in general in an economi in which the unemploy rate is continu to come down  energi price are revers some of this year   s run up  and interest rate surpris on the low side  we don   t think our forecast is too much of a stretch   we are awar  howev  that it is higher than the automak are current say and higher than most other outsid forecast are current project
rememb  that a flat forecast   becaus scrappag is rise   impli a signific slowdown in the rate of increas in the number of vehicl on the road  that probabl has to occur at some point becaus we   re run out of space   but that   s a forecast that was more confid made a decad ago  as the market continu to rise   i think it has becom a veri tough forecast to make   in my view    is just as like to be right as the whole structur of the research oper of gm
it is a tough forecast to make  and of cours  the automak may also be run out of room to provid incent or price cut and still be viabl
i   m just worri about run out of street space
that   s anoth constraint
i just wonder     if you would give us some sens of the sensit of the baselin forecast to chang in the budget outlook that we made refer to earlier   what happen if the tax cut and everyth els are made perman   what is the implic of some of the fiscal action that peopl have been bandi about   how much   it matter in term of the forecast
well  obvious  it could matter consider   we are anticip the budget deficit basic to remain at      billion or thereabout in fiscal year      and to edg down onli to      billion in        if one were concern that the current polit configur were go to result in less fiscal disciplin  or at least had the possibl of produc an environ with less disciplin  one could imagin more spend   and on the tax side  certain make the tax provis perman would be like to boost interest rate  and there   s alreadi some expect of that built into current interest rate   so onc it happen or if that uncertainti were remov  we might get somewhat higher long term interest rate come about from that  but it wouldn   t be a complet innov in the market   s think at this point  we are not veri good polit prognost   so in essenc  in this forecast we are anticip continu supplement to support ongo oper in iraq   we have incorpor the tax law chang that have occur to date  but we aren   t anticip ani further signific cut  and there is implicit some restraint on nondefens nondiscretionari spend in here   that is an area where it seem to me the uncertainti could perhap be the greatest  have said that  i must say that i can think of a lot of other thing that would have a bigger and more immedi impact on the economi   we have shot a whole lot of fiscal bullet off here  and it   s rather hard to imagin anoth coupl of year of s ulus that would averag the   percent that we   ve seen over the last three year   one could hope or imagin that there might be more disciplin than we   ve built into our forecast  though i don   t see the distribut of risk as strong support worri about too much fiscal restraint at this point   so i think somewher between the basic neutral fiscal polici that we   ve built into the forecast and the s ulus that has occur over the last three year is probabl in the right neighborhood   we have someth that averag a littl less than   point in      and      as extra s ulus from fiscal polici
mayb i misperceiv this  but your model seem to have troubl generat a high inflat outcom   what is it that produc a    high inflat    scenario with almost no materi increas in inflat   the differ in the monetari polici assumpt that underpin that scenario is not that larg   so is there some failur of imagin in the forecast that we could correct for
i certain welcom your imagin  laughter  if you wish to appli it to this particular problem   my colleagu       who present some of this materi in his chart show present in juli  might want to jump in here   but it isn   t aggreg demand  as you point out  or polici assumpt becaus inflat in the unit state is veri inerti and not terribl sensit to chang in the output gap   now i know when tell our stori that  becaus we have so few hook on which to produc inflat in the forecast  the monetari polici assumpt can often sound as if it featur veri promin when  in fact  it  sn   t  there   s obvious consider uncertainti on the suppli side  both with respect to thing like oil price or commod price that could  if they doubl again in the come year   and one could imagin such a develop   provid signific upsid surpris or an even more pronounc slow in structur labor product than we are project   we   re concern about that latter possibl as well  and we show an altern simul with a product slowdown   again  one could use even more imagin and think that mayb it would slow even more dramat than we   re show  in which case cost pressur on busi are go to manifest themselv more intens than we   re current anticip in the project   so those are a few stori that one could tell  the honest truth about the width of the fan chart that we show with regard to our forecast is that a lot of that is just unexplain residu in the model   the model are explain onli about    percent of the year to year variat in the inflat rate   we have been wrong in the past on inflat  and we will be wrong in the futur   our model seem to explain onli a portion of the variat in inflat  and we recogn that our ignor is a big sourc of uncertainti in the outlook
two of the question i had teed up to ask have been ask and answer  let me just focus on one   the staff continu to have an assumpt of less tighten in the fed fund rate than is expect in the market   i   m not sure if that has chang a lot sinc the septemb meet on either side   you are say  i think  that with last friday   s labor market report in hand you would have rais the forecast in this month   s  book a bit   i was wonder if you would also suggest a differ trajectori for the fed fund rate embed in your forecast
well  i think the employ report would not chang our fund rate forecast veri much   one of the thing that i tri to highlight in my remark  though  is that there are a coupl of realli major piec of the outlook   such as movement in the exchang valu of the dollar and movement in the stock market   where as a matter of joint strategi we are embed in the forecast a pretti neutral assumpt   for exampl  the dollar   s path is almost like a random walk  and the stock market will just go up at the risk adjust return that one can get in the bond market   now  it   s quit conceiv to me that particip in the market might be factor in some combin of develop in those area that  with the kind of fund rate path we   ve written down  could produc more s ulus either becaus spend will be more interest sensit or becaus the transmiss of the fund rate into asset market could be more power than we   re assum in our forecast  so we write down our fund rate path as sort of a condit assumpt and  obvious  as develop chang  we react to that   but in your consider as a policymak and in think about the full rang of the risk that you   re confront with  you might want to ask  could it be that the set of the fund rate would produc either consider more spend or inflat than the staff has incorpor   i also note that it   s still the case   and it   s one of the factor that we are struggl with and don   t realli have a clear answer to   that we haven   t over the past two year gotten as much activ out of veri  veri low real interest rate as we would have anticip   as i note in respons to a question by presid   last  e  some of that is appar in hous and some in busi invest also where  even though the growth rate have recov  the level of spend as a share of gdp look to us pretti darn depress relat to the trend that one might have anticip in respons to these low rate   and in our forecast we   re carri forward some of that unexplain weak   obvious  if that unexplain weak were to diminish more rapid than we envis   if we get more spend and more output   we   d have a higher fund rate path associ with the outlook as well
further question      i notic that the unit import price exclud petroleum for the month of octob  which was releas today  is negat for the first  e this year   do you have ani notion as to what that is about
i   m afraid you   ve caught me without an answer   i   m not sure what the element of that are
could you take a look at that when you have a chanc
if there are no other question  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the seventh district economi has firm sinc our last meet   mani of our manufactur contact outsid the auto industri report strong order and sale as well as a grow backlog   the improv have been broad base  with particular strength in heavi equip   engin produc cannot keep up with strong demand and have put truck manufactur on alloc   and caterpillar   s ceo told me that busi is the best he has seen in his thirti two year in the industri   in contrast  both ford and gm were disappoint in their octob result and reduc next year   s outlook for light vehicl sale slight  to around      million unit   on a posit note  one automak was pleas that they were abl to lock in steel price for next year below current spot price   with regard to the labor market  businesspeopl in our area report more hire   our contact at kelli  the temporari staf firm  note that order are rise more rapid and that perman placement fee continu to increas   and they say that it is no longer as easi to find qualifi worker  we also hear from other contact that skill tradespeopl in manufactur and even part  e retail help for the holiday season are harder to find   all of this is consist with the stori that we   ve heard around this tabl for sever meet now  although growth is more solid  we do not see the kind of upward pressur on wage and price that would indic that we   ve fulli close the output gap   there are some except  sever contact do note that wage are rise somewhat fa    some even say that  for the first  e in sever year  they occasion have to pay bonus to hire and to retain worker  nonetheless  overal growth in wage remain modest  especi in light of the strength that we   ve seen in product growth  in term of price  supplier are find it somewhat easier to pass higher cost along to their busi custom   we   re hear about this in construct materi and heavi equip  in addit  the weaker dollar is rais the wholesal price of import good  as a larg specialti retail report to us   howev  there is littl evid of a general pass through of higher input cost to consum price   so on balanc  we think the economi has a way to go befor the output gap is fulli close  turn to the nation outlook  clear the economi has emerg from the midyear soft patch   consum spend has rebound   the octob job figur certain was long overdu good news  and our contact are less skittish about the outlook for demand   but the data and the anecdot don   t seem to point to a widespread surg in growth   it feel more like growth that is onli modest fa  than potenti  despit the substanti degre of monetari accommod  two factor seem to be hold back growth   the first is higher energi price  which we   ve talk about a lot   and we   ve seen quantit es  of their impact   and the second is busi caution   even though busi seem more sanguin  there continu to be an under hesit to take on larg scale invest or hire commit  roger   discuss busi caution in our last meet  and i   d like to elabor on one aspect of that phenomenon   i think in part this caution in invest and hire is relat to a continu and even increas level of concern about sarban   oxley  especi it provis on intern control   the more i hear from ceo and peopl who sit on corpor board  the clearer it is that sarban   oxley is lead to signific  and i think still evolv  chang in decisionmak   corpor seem more risk avers   they oper under a veil of caution   i hear repeat stori of compani make decis much more slowli   in addit  they   re discard project that they might otherwis have undertaken   now  quantifi these factor is hard  statist model can give us an idea of how higher energi price are hold back activ  but they give us littl guidanc on how to calibr the influenc of higher risk avers   nevertheless  i believ that it   s like to be signific   so in the context of polici  this uncertainti make it appropri to continu be measur in how we remov polici accommod   of cours  if we see energi price rais long run inflat expect or if we see busi caution and resourc slack dissip substanti  then we may need to move more aggress
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll start with the report from my wal mart friend   he began by say that wal mart see demand as    realli weak      that   s the term he use  august same store sale show the lowest growth rate wal mart had seen for some  e  and septemb   octob sale were also weak   i think the compani has announc it octob number public   year over year sale growth in octob was     percent  includ the club  but for wal mart itself the figur was     percent   so he believ  given the demograph  that the lower end of the incom distribut that typic shop at wal mart is    stress     as he put it   go forward  wal mart is project increas of   to   percent in same store sale  their current point es  is     percent  my contact in the truck industri said that the economi is do okay but is not boom  in his view  if the economi had been boom  there would have been real problem in the transport sector becaus of problem in both rail and truck capac   he note that a truck assembl plant is now ship truck down the assembl line without tire   appar there   s a shortag of truck tire at the moment   i assum that   s just a spot issu   he said that his compani itself had not had ani difficulti in term of the avail of tire   he indic that retail expect a normal holiday season   he said that the west coast dock situat is about unchang and that rail servic remain poor but is not get wors   he also report that the truck rate they were abl to charg in the third quarter were up a littl over   percent year over year  on a more op ist note  my contact at fedex said that fedex see continu strong demand in everi sector   the compani   s ground busi is up about    percent year over year  and domest freight is up about    percent   and signific  i think  fedex is ad substanti to it capit spend plan for next year  anticip an increas in capit expenditur of    to    percent   the compani has not seen ani wage pressur but is expect to see some   the toughest employe to find at this point is one with account skill   a develop no doubt relat to sarban   oxley  which is tighten the market for those skill everywher  my up contact said that the compani is hire aggress for the peak holiday season  they   re even hire new pilot for the first  e in some year   the labor market for it profession has tighten accord to my contact at up   he note that they are see the first signific chang in direct in the it skill market that they   ve seen for some  e   up has revis up it volum project for next year   in fact  they   ve made two revis just in recent week  particular in their intern busi and especi in shipment outbound from asia  much of which of cours come to the unit state  for the first  e i call a contact at a west coast softwar firm  and he said that their pc forecast is run at just a modest level  unchang from where it has been recent   somewher in the neighborhood of   to    percent is probabl the easiest way to character it   i thought the most interest thing he said was that in their view the labor market had becom    brutal more competit      that   s the phrase he use   in term of hire softwar engin and also general manag talent   he said that they are get lot of resum but mayb onli one in forti applic is worth hire   and he note that his firm has been affect by the reduct in the number of visa for talent that can be brought in from abroad   i think that   s about all i want to say in that regard  one issu that i have been spend some  e on is tri to understand what we might mean by the    normal    real feder fund rate   if one goe back over histori  that rate is extrem variabl   but compar with histori  i think we   re probabl get more or less into the rang of what one might call    low normal     though i don   t think we   re quit at normal yet   i just want to say that  if you scan the data sinc the korean war  no matter how you cut it  what is most impress is just how variabl the short term real feder fund rate is   thank you
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   the red sox win certain help    laughter   there   s no question about that   but after allow for that  i would say that the economi in new england is expand even independ of the red sox   employ is grow or is at least stabl versus a year ago in all six state  and the unemploy rate is down  even measur rate of inflat in the district are trend down  and inflat is moder more in the boston area than nation   consum and busi confid have pick up and remain higher than they were a year ago   tourism in boston has been veri strong  though elsewher in new england it has been affect by cool and raini weather   residenti real estat market in all major metropolitan area continu to be strong  particular for low to moder price home  and both manufactur and retail contact were for the most part upbeat and project reason to strong demand and revenu growth   concern and uncertainti remain  to be sure   and growth is variabl  with firm in the health care and defens area grow more rapid than other   but overal the expans   seem to have enter a period in which it is on relat solid foot  dure the period sinc our last meet  we   ve been rather busi at the boston fed   we   ve held four forum for local banker and businessmen around the district  we   ve met with our academ advisori council as well as with a group from local softwar compani  we   ve had two meet of our director in a relat short period of  e  and we   ve talk with our regular beig book contact and focus a lot of attent on local manufactur and their concern  pull the data from all these sourc togeth  i want to touch on a few common theme that were evid to us in this period of extens outreach  in manufactur particular  but elsewher as well  rise oil and natur gas price and rise price for commod such as copper  aluminum  and resin emerg as a concern   one person in electr and electron manufactur refer to an environ of   and i quot      hyperinfl     note that price increas could at  e be pass on even to big box retail  accord to this sourc  rapid rise input price have made plan ahead quit difficult   this contact was admit an outlier  but most manufactur and retail express concern about the impact of higher oil price on both demand and cost  contact continu to be cautious about hire  even when expect growth and net revenu gain are posit   they report see a new employe as an addit to    fix cost     given the difficulti they had experienc in downsiz dure the recess   and i would agre with presid   about the impact of sarban   oxley   that is contribut to a lot more caution on the part of busi  particular in the hire arena and to some degre in the spend arena as well   moreov  depend on the busi  find new employe with the right technic skill was seen to be both difficult and expens   and most contact also mention rise benefit cost as a further deterr to hire  plan for increas capit spend rang from modest to relat strong  with a continu focus on reduc cost and improv product   most contact expect profit margin to continu to be solid  especi in the biotech area   the region   s export have benefit consider from the slowli fall   less slowli than befor   dollar   one paper and pulp produc report record oversea sale and the abil to make price increas stick in high grade product  high tech contact both in softwar and in manufactur report on what they saw as a larg inventori swing this year from which the industri was still in the process of emerg   in late       veri short suppli chain and rapid rise demand lengthen deliveri  e and prompt a degre of over order   when the semiconductor industri  in particular  caught up late in the first quarter of       inventori swell and order stop  give the impress of a larg falloff in demand   our contact describ this as more of a suppli chain phenomenon than a weaken of under demand  which they at least believ remain not great but relat solid  final  in mani type of industri concern were voic about u s  immigr polici  which has ad to the problem of find qualifi labor even in low valu ad servic industri   for small softwar compani  restrict on immigr combin with the impend requir to expens stock option even in a start up  privat held compani will prove difficult as the talent need will either choos to return to their nativ countri or never come to this countri at all   in sum  new england has had it challeng  to be sure   but overal  econom activ in the district seem to be good   not great as yet  but gain traction much like in the rest of the countri  on the nation scene  data receiv prior to last week had been good but also not great  obvious  consumpt bounc back in the third quarter from depress second quarter level  hous invest had remain strong  and purchas of auto had continu to surg whenev incent were offer   howev  new hire had been slow  and both the michigan and the confer board indic of consum confid had move down  particular in the area of futur expect   busi invest was okay  particular for non high tech good  but some of the strength was like borrow from next year  and as i note befor  busi remain cautious   rise oil price seem pois to take a bite out of both consum and busi spend and to damp foreign demand as well  though as yet such price increas have not had an endur effect on growth   and we continu to hit new high in term of the extern deficit  which has been a drag on econom growth and has contribut to a somewhat fa  pace of dollar depreci  last week thing began to look a bit brighter   whether you come from a red state or a blue state  you have to be happi that the elect is final over   result notwithstand  that has to take one element of uncertainti out of the mix   and of cours  friday   s employ news was veri welcom   obvious one month  even with revis to prior month    not a trend make  but the news of         new job sure brighten my outlook   our forecast in boston is pretti close to that of the  book  and we had made it prior to friday base on the hope  not the realiti  of better employ data in the short run   now that forecast seem  at least for the present  to have fewer downsid risk  and i   m begin to think about whether we might find ourselv want to move a bit fa  toward that elus neutral stanc of polici   but that is certain a discuss for anoth meet   for now  match market expect seem the sensibl thing to do   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the fifth district economi continu to expand in recent week   manufactur growth continu but seem to be slow a bit   our shipment index fell somewhat but remain solid in posit territori   the new order index  howev  slid toward a neutral read  and our manufactur employ index remain at neutral as well   mani contact in manufactur continu to comment on higher materi price   a manag at rohm and haa in north  ina note ethylen and propylen price increas  but said he was hold the line on his product price   and a g e  manag in south  ina note increas in raw materi price but said price for the turbin he produc were rise even fa   our most recent survey still indic strong growth in revenu and employ in the servic sector   retail activ appear to have slow sinc the end of the period cover in our beig book report   big ticket sale in particular seem to have been weak in recent week  and most of the auto dealer we survey said sale were down   one of our director in the energi busi said that in his view energi price were unsustain high  and he cite sever factor that he thought indic they   d be come down signific soon   he also report that mani ceo he knew were complain about the expenditur requir to compli with sarban   oxley  they thought it was a major drag on the economi   in particular  he note a scarciti of the skill personnel necessari to implement those system   a north  ina banker said that  although there are pocket of negat  his contact general thought the busi outlook was good there   and a contact in west virginia report that railroad ship is a signific problem for the coal industri   he cite scarciti of labor in that sector  turn to the nation economi  the octob job report show healthier employ growth sinc the summer  and this suggest greater strength in the labor market than we had previous suppos   aggreg hour are alreadi more than    percentag point abov the third quarter averag  and the steadili increas growth in averag hour earn that has been in train for month evid continu into octob   the rise in both hour and wage give a welcom boost to person incom  and that should help support strong growth in consum spend go forward   rise wage togeth with slower product growth have push the growth in unit labor cost up to or even abov the rate of inflat recent so that the disinfl risk continu to abat   all told  with inflat and inflat expect well anchor  the economi appear to be do notic better than it seem at the  e of our last meet   and if the economi maintain it strength  we will need to continu to let the fund rate rise  as i see it  we are like to be balanc two relat concern go forward   first  there   s the continu weak in busi invest spend relat to what we might have expect  given the strong cash flow and low interest rate we   ve seen this year   becaus of this  i think we are like to want to keep our real interest rate increas to a measur pace   howev  market particip expect us to rais the fund rate fa  than the  book project is necessari to maintain price stabil   the discrep between market expect and the  book forecast suggest a second concern that we might at some point fall behind the curv  as it were  in tighten monetari polici  if the job market gain momentum in come month and suspicion about the sustain of the recoveri reced  real inflationari pressur could well develop   in that case  we would want to act decis to preempt ani uptick in inflat rather than await an uptick and then react  and i presum we would do so   but even if inflat remain perfect stabl  we will need to let the real interest rate rise as the economi gain strength   we shouldn   t let stabl inflat expect lull us into adjust the equilibrium real rate less rapid than is requir to resist a real boom and bust cycl such as we saw in the late      s   in the current case  it will be difficult to discern when and how much interest rate tighten will be necessari in the period ahead  just as it was then   but abov all  we don   t want to encourag the belief that we signal a steeper expect fund rate path onli in respons to tangibl sign of shift inflat expect becaus our ul  goal is to elimin such shift
thank you  mr  chairman   let me first talk a littl about the region  which has continu to show expans sinc our last meet   despit some tentat on the part of busi and consum that i think was tie to the elect  we   re see some rather posit develop   consum spend edg up a bit dure this recent period   auto manufactur  as i   ve heard other say  was a littl slow   that was driven veri much by whether or not incent were be offer  as they were pull off  sale have gone down   so i suspect sale incent will come back as we move through the rest of this year   energi activ in our region has risen rather brisk with the higher oil price and especi the higher natur gas price  we   ve seen a lot of activ develop as a result of that  as i mention  mani of our contact said that the preoccup with the elect was caus busi and consum both to do some postpon   with that behind us  they realli do expect some pickup in activ   i would also mention that on the manufactur side we have seen some pretti posit develop continu across our region  particular in support of small manufactur   that was veri encourag to us   we   ve seen indic from a number of busi that they are more forward look than i   ve ever seen in term of what they   re prepar to do and their expect for increas busi   there is  i think  a chang in attitud develop that is worth note  look at the nation level go forward  we judg that the continu accommod stanc of monetari polici and some of the eas of headwind creat by energi price should now contribut to a healthi pace of econom growth in      and        specif  it appear as though growth will remain abov trend  in the     to   percent rang  as other have note   while i do not want to make too much of one data releas  i agre with the point other have made that the payrol number do provid some evid of a signific more posit forecast than we might otherwis have been think about   i would also note that  with this kind of growth continu  there are some indic that price could move up mayb a tenth or two in the first part of next year   we will see  of cours  there are some upsid as well as downsid risk that i think we have to keep in mind   first of all  on the upsid  i think the remov of some of the uncertainti that has been in the market is a veri import factor go forward   as for the labor market  i think their strength is evid in more than just this last report   if we look at the revis that were made to the data for previous month  we   re now talk of averag month increas of about         over the last four month  and in my view that   s a pretti healthi pace   if it continu  that may point to a more op ist outlook for consum spend as we move forward   also  with the adjust in the dollar  we may see some reduct in our current account deficit  which will be less of a drag on the gdp number   as for the downsid risk  i think we may see some increas in person save   i believ it will be veri modest  but it may be a factor offset attitud toward increas consum spend   final  while energi price have been back off  energi is alway a wild card and could be a player as we move forward   on balanc  though  i think the outlook is favor  which in my view put us in a posit where we should continu to remov our polici accommod and move back toward the neutral stanc of polici that we   d like to attain   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   all thing consid  the nation economi continu on what i regard as a veri accept pace   real gdp for the past six month has advanc at a rate of more than   percent   this is abov the averag rate of     percent we experienc dure the     s expans and with less volatil than we experienc dure that period   furthermor  our model suggest that this growth is abov the project trend growth rate of about    percent  which impli that there are no signific output gap   consum spend remain solid  and invest spend continu to make a good contribut to growth  while the usual suspect for shock and worri remain   oil  war  terror  fiscal polici  the dollar  and other   i share the sens that there   s a high probabl that balanc growth at or abov trend will continu over the forecast period  most of us  like    have been puzzl for some while over the atyp pattern of job growth in this postrecess period   i see last week   s unexpect strong number as a bonus   the overal employ outlook now look more promis  but like sever other  i would suggest that we not overemphas one month   s data  nor do i think we should expect a return to the experi of the     s   that experi   the         plus month job growth that some began to think of as the norm   with hindsight may veri well have been reflect a transitori acceler rather than herald a shift in the under pace of sustain job creation   and that extraordinari experi may have contribut to an over op ist es  of the nairu  similar  i   m also remind  as other have suggest  that a signific portion of the product growth we thought was take place was subsequ revis away as new data came out   the point is that we should not let the job situat play too domin a role in our polici discuss but should concentr instead on get the fund rate back to a more neutral stanc  much of what i see happen in the nation economi is also evid in our district  consum spend is good  state govern tax collect have been increas   hous construct continu at a high level  and much of the structur downsiz in the region   s manufactur sector appear to be behind us  the hurrican clear took their toll on our region  and that impact will show through in the measur of econom activ for a while   tourism has been especi hard hit   a number of hotel in florida are still out of commiss  but these are most small and in secondari tourist market   major destin area like miami  fort lauderdal  orlando  et cetera  are larg unaffect   nevertheless  our contact are report that tourist remain skeptic and that advanc book for next fall are down   in addit  high fuel price  when layer on top of other structur problem  have essenti brought delta airlin to it knee   our other region base airlin  airtran  has also post a loss for the third quarter as a result of high fuel price and hurrican relat disrupt to air travel  also  notwithstand the comment i just made about the strength of hous construct  we have seen in anecdot inform just a hint of slow in the pace of home sale   i don   t think we should be surpris to see a level off in that sector as some of the one  e effect of peopl shift from apart to hous or move up to larger home wind down at current interest rate  final  build on a comment the chairman made  i would note that hurrican ivan ad to our short term oil problem by destroy a signific number of oil and gas pipelin in the gulf of mexico   sinc mid septemb some     percent of year oil product from the gulf has been lost  and that region repres  i believ  around a third of total u s  product   these loss caught refineri by surpris  and the u s  refineri have struggl to make up for the loss   in the first week of septemb  refineri were run at about    percent of oper capac   in the last week of septemb they were at    percent  and current they are run at about    percent of capac  these issu asid  i believ that if one step back for a broader look at where we are with the economi  we seem to be on a veri accept track   polici remain extrem accommod  elect uncertainti is behind us   with real growth on what look to be a good and sustain path  with inflat still moder  and with the employ pictur at least a bit more promis  i believ that the polici path we have been on is the correct one   i hope we will continu to remov more of the accommod  as financi market expect   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ continu to expand at a modest pace in the third district   this is the sens we get from the discuss we have had late with our various advisori board and from the general tone of the data we have been gather about the district  manufactur has held up well and continu to be a strong perform   this is in spite of the dip in the septemb busi outlook survey  bos  index of general activ to       which i report last meet   at that  e i note that the declin seem inconsist with the strength in new order and shipment as well as with the posit comment from our respond   the sharp rebound in the activ index in octob to    seem to indic that the dip was a one  e aberr from a longer term posit tone in the bos   this view is also support by the fact that the new order and shipment index have remain at veri healthi level and by the strengthen in the employ index this month   our survey suggest that respond see strength in manufactur through the rest of the year as well   in our special question this month  about    percent of the firm survey report that they   re plan to increas product in the fourth quarter  about    percent say they will keep product at the current level  and onli    percent plan reduct   rough the same number of firm plan to increas their inventori of finish good as to decreas them   if you put all of this togeth  it suggest that firm expect sale to be increas   i   d also note that the survey suggest that firm are gain some price power  there has been an increas in the number of respond who report that they   re begin to increas their price in respons to rise cost of metal and energi  turn to the retail sector  sale of general merchandis in our region continu to grow at a moder pace  which is consist with retail    expect   our retail expect christma sale to be fair good but not excess strong   home sale in the district remain strong  and hous price appreci continu at a high rate in our three state   but residenti construct activ continu to moder from the veri strong pace earlier in the year   nonresidenti construct remain soft  but we   re begin to see a pickup in the commerci sector  which includ offic build and warehous outsid the manufactur sector   contract for commerci build are up slight on a year over year basi  our employ data are a bit old   the octob employ number for our three state have not yet been releas   howev  base on unrevis number through septemb  employ growth in our three state region was stronger than in the nation   it slow in the third quarter from the second quarter but remain in line with expect   given the upward revis in the nation employ number in august and septemb  i would not be surpris to see our state number revis up as well   the labor market in new jersey are the strongest  and those in pennsylvania the weakest   the weak in pennsylvania seem to be distribut statewid  but philadelphia has been particular weak   payrol declin in philadelphia over the past quarter  nonetheless  our busi contact continu to report that they are have difficulti find qualifi worker   this seem to be true for lower skill manufactur job as well as for higher skill technic posit  turn to the nation  incom data suggest that the economi has bounc back from the soft patch it hit this summer   now even the payrol employ data are consist with this view  despit the rise in oil price  growth this year is like to be in the     to   percent rang  as a number of other have alreadi indic   although we saw an uptick in core inflat in septemb  inflat remain low  and the latest employ data show that payrol have grown at about         job per month this year   this is a fair good show for the economi  as far as i   m concern  the cours for polici today seem straightforward   we should continu on our path of remov accommod at a measur pace and maintain most of the languag in the committe   s last announc   this would be consist with the econom data we have receiv and is also wide anticip in the market   nonetheless  i think we should begin to think about our longer term polici strategi   the employ report suggest that the expans may now be on a solid foot   of cours  it is onli one data point  as a number have said   or mayb three data point if one consid august  septemb  and octob   so i don   t want to get overconfid   still  i think we may want to begin to question whether a measur pace is an appropri descript of the pace of monetari polici tighten we are like to need over the next sever quarter  by the way  i recogn that the  book forecast assum a veri slow movement in the fed fund rate   inde  one might complain that    measur    may be too rapid a character   laughter   nonetheless  we need to consid that at this point two key risk to the outlook   higher oil price and a sharper depreci of the dollar   may put pressur on inflat some  in the futur   given the lag in the effect of monetari polici on the economi  we should be prepar to move rapid if that becom necessari   this lead me to think that if the data between now and our decemb meet are similar to what we have been see so far  the committe may want to consid prepar the market and market particip for the possibl of a steeper path of polici tighten go forward   for today  i see no reason to alter either the risk languag or the measur pace languag in our statement
thank you  mr  chairman   ohio may have decid the countri   s presidenti elect last week  but it  sn   t seem to be determin the economi   s direct   i   m afraid i   m go to be a bit of an outlier in my report on econom condit   ohio was the battleground state  and it may be that busi and peopl in ohio are just weari from this long elect cycl    laughter   but as was evidenc in the beig book  fourth district condit seem to be less buoyant than those in the rest of the countri   businesspeopl i talk to around our district are report onli modest growth in product and sale   and in fact  i   m see a grow dichotomi in what my busi contact tell me  base on where they sell their good and servic  those who sell onli local tend to be somewhat pessimist about busi condit  wherea those who sell nation and intern express more op   my local busi contact gave me veri littl reason to anticip the strength that we saw in the octob employ report   now  the report could be just anoth bad exit poll    laughter   but our district clear is go through an industri realign that may not be indic of develop in the nation as a whole   notwithstand the strong overal octob employ report  manufactur shed anoth       job in octob follow a declin of        job in septemb   and ohio   s employ remain   percent lower than it was at the peak of the last busi cycl  while nation employ is up onli   percent   the octob employ report   squar with the fact that we are see an improv nation pictur  but the experi of this past spring make me leeri of allow one month   s data on employ to unduli influenc my think about the labor market   i still hear from most of my busi contact  regardless of where they do busi  that they expect to meet rise demand without ad substanti to their payrol   from these comment  i expect that product could be higher than in the staff   s baselin forecast  perhap more in line with the higher product scenario shown in the  book  businesspeopl also continu to report cost pressur  obvious from oil price but also from higher price on a wide rang of nonpetroleum materi   i have yet to see ani convinc evid  though  that these cost pressur have becom a part of general inflat   retail price and wage growth remain subdu  and inflat expect seem to be hold steadi  this is in part becaus my busi contact  unlik those of presid    say that they still find it veri difficult to pass on these price increas to their custom  especi to custom that produc finish good   consequ  they are still busi alter their product process to substitut away from some of these more expens commod  if possibl   one of my director  a veri larg intern produc of vinyl side and deck materi  state that her capit invest are all direct at raw materi substitut  take all of this into consider  it seem to me that our monetari polici stanc is about right at the moment  presum an action today   my view on the appropri polici in the futur  though  will be strong influenc by the incom data on econom activ   i also want to have the necessari flexibl to adjust polici as econom develop unfold   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with just a few comment about the district economi   recent report on consum spend have been mix  we had one relat strong month of spend on auto and in non auto retail sale  follow by a much more modest pace of sale in the next month   an area that has pick up  though  has been tourism  where better weather late in the summer and in the fall has clear benefit that sector   manufactur has continu to expand in the district  and agricultur appear to be have a good year for the most part  a littl over a week ago  we host at the bank a meet on hous and residenti construct activ   there were sever reason for this   one  of cours  was the fact that we hear period discuss of a potenti bubbl in hous price   but second  i   ve been struck  as i   ve watch develop in the twin citi and as i   ve travel around other citi in the last sever year  by the absolut high level of construct activ that seem to be occur   it   s not onli new build  but convers of all sort of warehous  school  and former offic build to residenti properti   a chang in mix seem to be occur as well  with more of the construct and renov yield townhous and condominium rather than the standard singl famili home  i thought it would be a good idea to tri to get some other peopl   s perspect on this  so we had at the meet a group of develop  lender  consult  and economist   they brought a nation perspect  although they did have special expertis in the twin citi market and a few other particular market across the countri   in general  i would say that their comment were posit and larg unsurpris   there was littl overal concern about a bubbl in hous price and littl anticip of a major correct in hous price in the near term   there was  howev  fair widespread agreement that the pace of increas was like to slow go forward  let me just note three specif issu that came up becaus i  at least  found them of interest  the first  which it won   t surpris this group to hear  is that they attribut a good deal of the strength in hous to veri favor financi condit   in this regard they talk not onli about low interest rate but also lower down payment requir   i might add that a coupl of the lender did say that they thought the credit pendulum had swung too far   they felt that credit condit had becom too easi  and they were anticip some potenti difficulti go forward   presum in somebodi els   s shop    laughter   second  they report that at least in some market a signific percentag of the purchas of new unit were by investor  where the term    investor    mean peopl who don   t intend to occupi the properti  at least not immedi  as best they could judg  in some market investor were buy up to    percent of the new addit to suppli   and final  they note that there seem to be some acceler of purchas by first  e homebuy who were concern that they were go to be price out of the market if they wait longer   the implic of that  of cours  are that at some point such sale will slow becaus peopl will have act if they could   so that   s a summari of that meet  let me turn to just a few comment on the nation economi   to me  the outlook for the nation economi continu to remain favor   i   d like to think that i would have made that statement even without the octob employ report  but of cours that   s a counterfactu  so we won   t be abl to observ it   but i do believ that growth is on a favor trend   i person think that the economi will grow a littl more rapid next year than the project in the  book  and i expect inflat to remain low  i   ve been ask myself this question   what is the neutral real feder fund rate   i find that a challeng concept  but i   ve tentat decid to think about it in term of what the rate is that would be consist with our price or inflat object over  e   now  of cours  we haven   t formal an inflat target  so i   m use the work definit of price stabil   that   s what i have in mind   and it seem to me  without go out on ani limb here  that it   s safe to say that the fund rate continu to be lower than it will need to be in the long run  so the trajectori we   re on seem to me to be appropri   thank you
shall we take a coffe break and return in fifteen minut  pleas   coffe break

thank you   i appreci the opportun to repres the dalla feder reserv bank here today   it has given me the opportun to have some veri high qualiti meet with our economist over the three short week sinc bob   indic that he was leav the bank  first  look at our district economi  over the period sinc the last fomc meet econom growth in the eleventh district appear to have continu at a moder pace   payrol employ in june  juli  august  and septemb show quit modest gain   like the nation  other indic show more strength than the payrol number   consumpt  as reflect by sale tax receipt  is grow at it most rapid pace sinc        person incom is up for the seventh consecut quarter  and survey of busi leader across texa show that busi confid is gain strength  howev  these posit statist seem to be somewhat at odd with the anecdot report that we have receiv from our head offic and branch board of director   for exampl  i mention that consumpt has shown consider strength  but from our director we   ve heard numer stori about the damp impact of higher gasolin price on consumpt   one of our el paso director is a rancher   he offer a stori about how the four cowboy he hire all show up to work last spring  each drive his own pickup truck and pull his own hors trailer   the same group show up a few week ago  but all four share a ride in one pickup and pull one trailer for all of the hors    laughter   they said that the cost of gasolin made the differ   i can assur you that in west texa no one worri about run out of street space

that   s as close to a bob   stori as you   ll get from me    laughter  speaker      it   s better than some of his    laughter
actual  higher energi price have had a posit impact on the oil and gas sector of our district economi   earlier this year  oil and gas activ had been expand veri sluggish in respons to the higher energi price   in the last two month  howev  we see grow evid that this is chang   explor and improv project have been announc in recent week by both the major and the independ   energi product is even expand in the dalla   fort worth metropolitan area  a region where output has been virtual shutter for the last eighteen year   so it is begin to appear that suppli forc are final respond to today   s price  let me note two addit sector where the tone of the region economi has improv  the offic market in dalla and austin are final show declin vacanc rate  confirm a sens of op  that began last summer   and commerci loan activ at texa bank has grown nice in the last two quarter  hope reflect improv busi confid and the begin of expans activ  final  our director and beig book contact report an absenc of wage pressur but some modest uptick in price pressur   i   d like to mention one develop that we   ve heard about that may allevi price pressur over the next few quarter   in       texa voter approv a          cap on non econom damag in medic malpractic suit   as a result  thirteen compani provid malpractic insur have reenter the state  and malpractic insur premium have drop by   to    percent in the last year   this develop has the potenti to restrain medic cost inflat in texa as it has done in other state  in look at the nation economi  we   ve been struck by how well it is do and how well it is expect to grow over the forecast period in spite of the long list of headwind it must overcom   we list six headwind that concern us  and i think most of them have been mention alreadi   first  consum confid has sag recent   second  busi seem somewhat less confid than at the begin of the year  at least as evidenc by survey from the nation feder of independ busi   third  energi price remain at a high level   fourth  we   ve had four consecut declin in the index of lead indic   fifth  the bonus depreci of equip and softwar will expir at year end   and sixth  demand growth in the rest of the world  while solid  is expect to slow somewhat   each of these headwind exert a small effect  but in combin they add up   the primari tailwind in the economi is come from monetari polici  and the strengthen balanc sheet of the busi sector  along with good profit growth  provid anoth tailwind that can and should support higher invest spend in the futur   the inflat outlook is mix and hard to assess   the declin to a mere     percent in the annual cpi inflat rate over the last three month and to an even lower     percent for the pce is set against a year over year inflat record that is less sanguin   core measur of inflat are in the     to   percent rang and have been on a mild uptrend sinc the begin of the year  one year inflat expect rang from     percent to over   percent  depend on the sourc  and long term inflat expect are anchor at or abov     percent  in review and evalu this inform with our economist over the last few week  we encount some difficulti in reach a consensus regard whether the committe should paus in rais rate at today   s meet   sever held the view  as did the major of our director when survey  that it was the right  e to paus   howev  after review last friday   s employ report  we have move from somewhat sit on the fenc to favor a continu of measur tighten   the most recent indic of strong employ growth  the level of the real feder fund rate  and market expect are the more compel factor in our consider
we feel reason comfort about the nation outlook   anecdot report continu to convey a sens of tentat about the strength of demand growth go forward  but the nation number have been pretti solid   the survey seem to us to show some soften in expect about the pace of expans in the period immedi ahead  but this still look like a modest declin from reason high level   on inflat  the anecdot report still reflect concern about rise cost even beyond energi  despit the substanti deceler in the price index we   ve seen   on balanc  to us the economi appear to have been quit resili in the face of the sustain rise in oil price  terrorist concern  elect uncertainti  et cetera   our forecast for real gdp growth is between     and   percent for      and       with core pce in the neighborhood of     percent on the assumpt that monetari polici follow a path of further measur tighten   we continu to see the risk as rough balanc around this forecast   relat to the  book  we are slight less posit on growth  but the differ is all due to net export   our quarter pattern in the next two quarter is a bit differ  but if you averag the two  we also show some deceler  we have a bit less confid that the now prevail equilibrium rate of interest is as low as mani believ  nor are we confid that we should at this stage plan to lean against the rang of potenti headwind out there   a higher household save rate  fiscal contract over a longer period of  e  negat net export  sustain busi caution  et cetera   by keep the fed fund rate lower than in the rang of more convent view on equilibrium for a longer period  the  book path is signific lower than the market path   so we assum a differ path for monetari polici  one closer to that now price into market  in broad term  we still see a moder expans in employ and in hour support pretti healthi compens growth and some deceler of consumpt expenditur  busi still seem to have the mean and the justif for continu quit strong rate of growth in invest   growth outsid the unit state has moder some but appear to be on a path around es  of potenti   for what it   s worth  the governor in basel this weekend seem to share a fair posit view of the strength of the expans global   as ecb presid trichet put it  the world economi is somewhat less dynam but still dynam  back to the unit state  we see product growth slow somewhat befor return to what we hope is the medium term trend of around     percent   the associ rise in unit labor cost in the interim is larg absorb in shrink profit margin  as competit hold down price power   with output growth close to potenti  inflat in our view should stay contain even as the gap narrow  we   re pretti comfort with this view  but we should recogn that it   s an except benign view of under inflat  and there are risk in the other direct   we don   t know that much about the size of the remain gap or the like path of product   we may face more dollar depreci  and it   s possibl that pass through may increas as foreign margin declin  the energi price pass through could also surpris us  it could prove higher than we expect given the size and persist of the recent shock and the persist expect in futur market   core finish good in the ppi  as we know  are still show fair high rate of increas   some model of inflat    e seri model   show more elev rate of increas and a higher probabl of increas abov our comfort rang   inflat expect at the one year and up to the five year horizon have move up again materi   though  of cours  some of that is just the respons to inflat in the pipelin from recent energi price increas  we face the same familiar risk to the outlook  which i won   t go through   the dollar   s resum declin has so far come without signific negat effect on risk premium on other financi asset in the unit state or  i think  signific appar damag to confid in europ  japan  and the other economi that have let their currenc move up against the dollar   i think it   s veri good to see some modest flexibl aris in mani emerg asian currenc  even though china has yet to move   perhap this offer some comfort about the prospect for a benign deflat of the u s  imbal  but the magnitud of these chang in relat growth rate and exchang rate obvious aren   t larg enough to make much differ now   we live  therefor  with the vulner   of an indetermin but grow probabl   of a substanti chang in the term on which nonresid are will to financ us   the world   s saver may still be somewhat underinvest in foreign asset in general  but they seem to be quit concentr in u s  asset  our product growth premium  sn   t seem that high relat to the plausibl es  of the dollar declin ahead   we have focus here so far primarili on scenario that anticip a veri benign adjust process that   s basic posit on net for the unit state and not that damag for the rest of the world   perhap it make sens for us to think a bit more about those scenario that come with a lot more collater damag  i think that we should leav our signal larg intact as we move today   the languag of qualifi op  we   ve use to describ the near term outlook seem about right   i don   t see a strong case for tri to convey more confid or more concern at this stage   i think it   s a good thing for us that the market is now price in a greater than    percent probabl of a move in decemb   in my view  we should seek to leav unchang the market   s expect of the path of the fed fund rate go forward   we don   t know enough now to justifi tri to talk them into a differ view in either direct  now  on the question of when to paus  how to transit to a slower pace of increas  and the slope of the fund rate path go forward  we   re obvious approach a more complic set of judgment   for now i think we want to continu to convey the sens that we plan to move further over the cours of this year toward a more posit real fed fund rate  though of cours at a pace that adjust with chang to our evolv forecast  i would not be that comfort with a presumpt of a flat fed fund rate for most of      or with that as the presumpt path from which we would deviat onli in the event of a veri posit shock to growth or a negat upward surpris in inflat   i   d be more comfort in a world where we keep the presumpt of a posit slope for the cours of        we can move in either direct from that path depend on how event unfold   i think we would have to have a fair amount of confid that we are in the midst of a few quarter of signific below trend growth to justifi push expect in the market down toward a flatter path   i   d rather take the risk in the approach that   s now price into the market than the risk that the fed fund rate would get stuck too low for too long and thus face greater risk of induc unanticip chang in the rate in the futur   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   solid growth  around the rate of the economi   s potenti  and low inflat seem to have becom even more entrench over recent month   at least so far  accommod monetari and fiscal polici and firm anchor inflat expect have provid a signific counterweight to the advers effect on both output and price from the appreci rise in oil price sinc june  although the rise in oil price until recent and a fade fiscal impetus will restrain demand to some extent for a few quarter  the level out of oil price and continu favor financi condit should support solid growth over  e   in fact  financi condit broad defin have becom even more accommod on balanc sinc our last meet with the fall in the dollar  the rise in equiti price  and a narrow of credit spread   and even if we do experi sever quarter of slower product growth  as in the staff forecast  i think resourc slack along with elev profit margin to absorb rise unit labor cost should continu to keep inflat expect in check  i was interest in the fact that the altern simul in the  book left both growth and inflat not far from the baselin   i don   t think this reflect entir a lack of imagin on the part of the staff   i do think it reflect the basic sound under fundament and associ compress in the rang of risk around a pretti desir econom outcom   dave   character this as less fundament fragil  and i think that   s right   but this veri favor outcom   depend on the path of interest rate  both the market and  even more  the staff see interest rate rise veri gradual and remain at unusu low level by histor standard as consist with solid growth and low inflat   as sever of you note  the staff see a veri shallow inclin in rate to onli    percent at the end of      and    percent at the end of      as consist with a gradual narrow output gap and persist low inflat   even the market  judg from the futur path  has a structur of rate built in that has a rise in the fund rate to onli around   percent by the end of next year and to     percent by the end of        this impli action on our part at fewer than half of the futur meet through the end of next year   in effect a slow from the recent pace   these expect not onli reflect low inflat expect but also embodi an unusu low and veri slow rise in real interest rate   i think that  in turn  is larg a reflect of recent experi in that the expans has been damp relat to the degre of monetari eas   busi and household have not respond to low interest rate the way histori would suggest  even after take account of the effect of higher oil price  i anticip when i made my project for much higher growth at the begin of this year that  as the effect of a seri of headwind abat  the under resili of the economi to low interest rate would begin to show through more   but despit histor low real interest rate  the output gap has not close much at all sinc earli this year and is project to remain around it current level through earli next year  with household save rate alreadi at histor low level  spend by this sector is unlik to be a sourc of strength in the futur  and i don   t think we can count on a substanti further strengthen in invest spend either   this might be a function part of the govern issu that     rais  but in addit busi don   t seem to have been great disadvantag by their cautious behavior  if that   s what it is   profit  product  and capac util data don   t seem to suggest that sale or profit opportun are slip away becaus firm have been slow to add to labor or capit capac   and firm probabl anticip onli moder growth in sale go forward  given the low save rate of household  limit growth in export market and domest demand abroad  and a still elev dollar   and these are not unreason expect  moreov  the margin return on new household and busi invest may be lower than we   ve experienc in recent year   it could be that spend on busi capit in the     s and household capit in recent year has left the level of those capit stock quit high   and as sever of you have note  the pace of technolog chang may be eb  as evidenc by slower declin in the price of high tech good and by the drop off in high tech invest  if for these or other reason the effect neutral rate remain low relat to histori  polici is not as accommod as it might appear by compar current rate to histori   and this judgment seem to be built into the market as well as the staff forecast   in my view  until we see evid to the contrari  we should expect that the damp respons to low interest rate will persist  and we should plan accord   i don   t know whether the staff   s assumpt of a polici rate that remain unchang for some  e after today is what will be requir   i kind of doubt it  as presid       but i think we should avoid do or say someth that would result in a substanti upward movement in intermedi  and long term interest rate   and those interest rate now build in a veri gradual and onli intermitt rise in the feder fund rate  a slowdown from our recent pace  our problem   not involv whether to rais rate at this meet   expect of an increas today have not imped keep intermedi  and long term rate low   but at some point  and that point may well be soon  even if the data come in rough along the line of the moder growth path in the  book  i think we   re go to have to signal the market   through deed as well as word   that we are not on a treadmil of higher rate at everi meet   if we don   t  we may risk tighter financi condit and subpar growth at a  e when inflat is alreadi low   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   oil price notwithstand  the odd that the economi will continu to grow abov trend and that core inflat will remain low and stabl seem reason good   growth has been solid this year despit the headwind creat by rise energi price and a widen trade deficit   by the magic of gdp growth arithmet  even if oil price and the trade deficit do not improv at all in       so long as they don   t worsen signific  growth next year will receiv a net boost  aggreg suppli constraint should not be a problem for the expans either   job creation last month was substanti  but the increas in the labor forc was even larger accord to the household survey   the employ to popul ratio remain low   the number of peopl work part  e for econom reason remain high  and the number of individu who are not in the labor forc but report that they want job increas by a half million last month  accord to the  book supplement   wage growth   not signal much pressur on labor suppli either   so in short  i think the economi still has some room to grow  the inflat fundament are likewis general encourag   over the past year  unit labor cost have risen onli     percent  and the under trend appear to be consist with core inflat at current level   energi cost are up  of cours  but non energi commod price have declin sinc our last meet and are up onli about     percent for      as a whole  use the crb spot industri index   the markup of price over unit labor cost remain close to it      peak  leav plenti of scope for busi to absorb higher labor and energi cost   the recent increas in the tip spread puzzl me a bit  particular as inflat compens at the five to ten year horizon is down   it   s also interest that  sinc the last fomc meet  both nomin bond yield and tip inflat compens have been negat correl with oil price  suggest that investor are concern more about the growth effect of higher oil price than about ani possibl inflationari effect  look forward  i think a reason goal for polici would be to tri to keep pce core inflat at about it current level in      and        in light of the energi situat and the fact that we are at a stage of the cycl in which inflat pressur some  increas  stabil core inflat is import to anchor inflat expect more firm and to provid a sound basi for the sustain expans   we should keep in mind  howev  that inflat can be too low as well as too high and be awar of overkil   as an illustr of possibl  a frb us simul provid to me by   reifschneid project that  if the fomc were to tighten by    basi point at everi meet in       we could be back in the disinfl soup by       what path of monetari polici is most like to be consist with both nomin and real stabil   i   ll just note here that the rang goe from two increas in the next year in the  book to about five increas next year in the market forecast   although polici  of cours  will depend on incom data  it seem not at all improb that we will choos to stand pat at a number of meet next year while continu to remov polici accommod at a measur pace   if this scenario seem plausibl  then we should probabl begin soon to signal to the public that paus may occur   in particular  as we reach a fund rate of   percent  it   s import not to give the impress that our futur fund rate increas will be automat or that the committe has some goal for the fund rate that is independ of the state of the economi   instead  we should focus on whether the overal thrust of monetari polici as reflect in the entir term structur and not just the fund rate is consist with our object   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   today  i want to focus my comment on inventori level and product  base on some convers i   ve had recent with busi folk   for the last sever year  i   ve watch the signific structur chang that have been made in inventori manag to lower inventori relat to sale   i   ve also seen the regular small adjust that firm make to keep inventori level in line with chang sale rather than incur a larg unintend buildup in inventori   as a result of both of these factor  inventori today are a much smaller sourc of volatil in the economi   in convers with nonfinanci busi execut  i continu to be struck by comment that they expect to be abl to reduc inventori   sale ratio further   they are continu to improv intern inform flow   and if they are a manufactur  they have link sale  procur  work schedul  and ship so that they can prompt make real  e adjust anywher along the busi process   thus  they expect a much lower likelihood of an unanticip buildup in inventori for all their various product line   they also feel that supplier have improv their process in order to respond more quick to chang sourc order and therebi enabl firm to further reduc inventori need  comment by these contact support the forecast in the  book  which anticip a further downward trend in inventori   sale ratio   as a result  inventori buildup will continu to provid a smaller share of real gdp growth in the futur  the other area i want to comment on is the chang pictur of product   the  book discuss product  includ two altern scenario   one with higher product and one with lower product   the baselin forecast for the second half of this year show product growth that is slower than the unusu high level we   ve seen over the last year   recent anecdot inform from my busi contact show a dichotomi go on with regard to product   on the one hand  these busi contact indic that they are continu to focus on improv product for competit reason and for qualiti reason  too   i might add that some of the requir of sarban   oxley are caus busi to focus on greater intern control   most of the contact i   ve talk with were abl veri quick to tick off mani process improv that they have under way  includ initi that they plan to undertak next year   they clear indic that this is a compon of ongo busi plan  it is no longer a one off kind of thing to get cost down to meet current competit   it   s a fundament chang in the way they do busi and the way they approach busi plan   the high fix cost of ad employe for moder and low salari grade   due primarili to benefit cost   and moral issu that firm have been work through with regard to employe retain after a downsiz are continu to put pressur on busi to manag staff addit veri care  so they are continu to tri to work with as lean a staff as possibl   howev  as the economi has continu to expand at a healthi pace  i   m hear more manag say that they recogn they are reach the limit of how much they can stretch their exist workforc in some busi unit  so some compani are begin to add employe   this again is consist with the  book notion that we may be at the stage of this econom expans where new hire will actual begin to show up in slower short run product number  final  let me just make some comment on sarban   oxley  which has been mention by other   i am hear a lot more focus on it from busi contact   a key trigger on this occur next week when all the third quarter    q report have to be file   busi execut realiz that the first assess under audit standard no    relat to sarban   oxley are as of year end  and when they file their    qs next week  they are within a month and a half of have to say whether their intern control structur are in complianc with that legisl   so i think we will begin to see more compani in their    qs next week start to hint to the market that some aspect of their intern control may still need attent  rather than store up the news until the new year  at this point they are far enough along that they alreadi can anticip whether they are like to have problem   they want to be clear and open about their intern control   ceo are veri worri about have to admit a major weak onli six week later and have to say     i didn   t know that we weren   t go to be readi      that is a risk to them   so i think the    qs next week could be veri interest   manag at all level is extrem focus on sarban   oxley as we approach the year end   i   m hear a lot of comment about it   and i think we   re go to begin to see some refer to it in the    qs this  e
thank you  mr  chairman   a standard forecast today  well repres by the  book baselin  assum a minim declin in the dollar and someth close to project current polici for the feder budget   it has the fund rate rise by rough half as much as is suggest by the fed fund futur market and find an output expans bare abov potenti  with a veri slow close of the output gap   inflat is pretti stabl in such a forecast  and it  sn   t take much of a negat shock to get the output gap not to close at all   in view of a forecast much like this  mani of you have impli in previous comment and also today that there might be paus in our rate rais process  that the equilibrium fund rate might not be so high after all  and that of cours we will alway be look at the data in our conduct of polici  i can   t disagre with ani of that   you   ve all been veri convinc  but it is a littl bore if we all say the same thing  so let me talk a bit about the other side of the question and focus on a coupl of longer run reason that in the end we might be forc to rais the fund rate more than in the  book path   i   m use the whole path here  i don   t want to even pretend to be precis about  e   i   m also not comment on the fed fund futur market  i can   t realli make comparison to that becaus i don   t know what market particip are assum  my first point involv the dollar   now  don  i promis never to say this public  but at least let me say it today   it   seem to me that the intern co depend truce  where the unit state is allow to over consum while foreign central bank are allow to print money to buy u s  treasuri  therebi support the dollar  may be close to becom unstuck   dino point out a few countri whose currenc have alreadi appreci relat to the dollar   japan  sn   t seem to be quit as will to support the dollar as befor  and china may have to fight it own inflat by clamp down on it own money growth   the dollar has drop sinc our last meet  and the current account deficit  even with the latest good news  continu at well abov the pace that stabil the intern debt   gdp ratio   the staff has provid a use memo that find that it would take a    percent drop in the dollar to stabil the debt to gdp ratio   given previous work of the staff that we   ve heard about  i did not find that particular result surpris  what i did find surpris in the memo was the fact that this fall in the dollar  by itself  could start core pce inflat rate on a steadi upward trend   perhap i had been deaden by the staff   s find of veri low pass through rate  but i think their deeper messag is that intern account are so far out of equilibrium now that there is a potenti for continu u s  inflat even with the low pass through rate   how like all of this is  i can   t say  but i think it could be an import problem we should keep our eye on  my second issu involv fiscal polici   i   ve long been a fiscal hawk   or realli a nation save hawk   for fiscal hawk  the onli redeem grace in american polit these day is polit gridlock   polit gridlock has just taken a big hit in the recent elect   specif  there are four budget conscious republican senat who have stood in the way of some of the more irrespons  in my view  budget bust polici   these four have just lost their block power  and in the strong tax cut atmospher  i worri about what will happen next   the tax cut are almost sure to be made perman  and while politician will talk a good game on spend cut  we all know how like those are  the administr has announc two broader prioriti for the next term   social secur reform and tax reform   there are lot of way to do social secur reform  but i think the most like is that some payrol tax revenu will be divert to individu account  with benefit payment to be cut onli in the far futur   in principl  recipi of these individu account should save exact the same as befor   but if individu are alreadi save in elig asset  will some of their payrol tax reduct show up as consumpt increas and nation save decreas   i bet they will  on the tax side  there will be statement that reform should be revenu neutral   but when loophol are close and some peopl actual have to pay more tax  how long will that last polit   i bet not long   i would be all for thoroughgo tax reform  but i great fear that tax reform will  in the end  be simpli anoth tax cut   with some tax go down and none go up  mayb i   m be excess paranoiac  but i worri great about the new fiscal atmospher   we may have a much more expansionari budget than the  book is present forecast  and it may happen fair quick without the friction of polit gridlock   this is anoth reason that i think we have to be at least think about higher rate than in the  book path  there is also an interact between these two point   if the budget fall even more out of balanc  nation save is like to drop from it alreadi histor low level  magnifi the current account deficit and the dollar problem   monetari polici can   t realli solv ani of these problem  but it can make them wors by let inflat come loos from it moor  obvious  none of this is certain   i am mere tri to point out that  while there are valid downsid risk in the forecast  some worrisom upsid risk have also recent come into view  let   s rememb that the uncertainti distribut still has two tail  as for polici  i   m perfect happi to go with the flow this  e   in the futur  we obvious can   t move the fund rate up at everi singl meet  and as mani of you point out  it would be nice to find a way to say or signal that   i   m not quit sure how to do that   i   m also not sure how readi for a more immedi paus i am   the whole paus issu   give me paus    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i will briefli continu on the same subject that governor   just discuss becaus i   d like to talk about fiscal polici issu for a moment  i   ve been encourag even with the absenc of gridlock   or at least to a certain extent the loosen of gridlock   that the presid and some of his team have focus on fiscal polici issu such as social secur and medicar   i take that as a posit sign   but in term of return to a budget surplus or even to budget neutral  i think it   s import to rememb that the last  e we were in that area  it was primarili a revenu issu and secondarili a spend or budget disciplin issu   now  there is noth in our forecast for the immedi futur that would suggest an economi that is pois to generat tax revenu in the    percent plus rang relat to gdp that allow for the surplus   but it is possibl at least to reinstat some of the spend disciplin by a re imposit of the paygo provis  and as governor   is well awar  the paygo provis also appli to tax cut   i think the reinstat of that polici would do two thing  first  it would impos some disciplin on the appropri process   one cannot be involv in the appropri process when paygo is in effect without be alert to it   second  it would be a signal of a return to fiscal disciplin and to fiscal manag polici  which i think could be import    so as the chairman and other indic at the begin of the meet  we should be out there talk about the need for fiscal disciplin   the chairman a few month ago spoke on the import of reinstat the paygo provis  and i would encourag other to consid that as you speak to the issu of fiscal polici  with respect to monetari polici  when we began to move from accommod toward neutral  we recogn that there were a number of risk associ with it  one of which as you may recal was a concern that rise rate might shut off ani improv in the under economi   also  i think we were a bit gun shi  given the success of exogen factor   terror  govern issu  and the like   that had derail the economi previous   as dino remind us earlier and as the chart show  longer term interest rate have actual declin  particular the ten year treasuri yield   so a derail has not happen   and even the parad of hurrican and the rise oil price have not signific deter this slow but steadi recoveri in the economi   i think the job number will be adjust margin  with the uncondit fire of everybodi involv in exit poll a few week ago    laughter   but even with that  it seem to me that the market clear anticip a continu reduct in the degre of monetari polici accommod and a return to neutral  and i think we ought to be stick with that cours
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m have some materi hand out here  and while that   s happen  let me say that i am in broad agreement with the baselin forecast in the  book   i find it a reason basi for make polici judgment at this meet and go forward   have said that  howev  i think the risk and uncertainti around the forecast are quit larg  and i find them veri difficult to reconcil   high on the list of upsid risk is one that dave   has alreadi highlight in his present  which is that the dollar may continu to depreci at a pace fa  than in the baselin   sinc dave spent some  e in his present discuss that  i won   t pursu it in my prepar remark  while the upsid risk from dollar depreci is clear  the possibl of a more persist pool of underutil resourc creat a more complex set of risk  and that   s what these chart that are be hand out now address   even consid the octob employ surpris  the chang in payrol employ have been remark subdu dure the cours of this turnaround  this observ led me to ask andi figura and bill wascher to prepar an analysi to explor labor market develop   i don   t know if it explain them   in the recess and postrecess period   in particular  i was interest in the question of whether this labor market perform is more easili explain by increas product or a shortfal of demand   the first step of the analysi i call for was to identifi the industri that have had unusu poor labor market perform sinc the      busi cycl peak  measur both absolut net industri employ chang and net industri employ chang relat to chang for a period of compar length preced the busi cycl peak  four industri at the two digit naic level rank as notic underperform in both absolut and relat term  and these are highlight in tabl     they were durabl manufactur  inform  transport and wareh  and profession and technic servic   now  it is  the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     well understood that one of the unusu featur of the recent downturn is the sizabl and persist increas in the share of layoff that have been perman   job destruct increas dure the recess and then fell back  while job creation fell dure the recess and has remain low   the four underperform industri that i just highlight more than account for the overal increas in the averag pace of job destruct between      and      and in the year      and       wherea job creation was more equal spread across industri   tabl   a and   b highlight the relat rank of various industri with regard to job creation and job destruct   the most interest question is the follow   is the slow net job creation  particular in these four underperform industri  due to demand shock  which would be a negat   or is it due to suppli shock  which would be a more posit develop in these industri   if you turn now to the next page  chart   clear indic that there   s a strong posit correl between chang in valu ad share and chang in employ share   the actual correl coeffici is       and it is signific at a   percent level   the four underperform industri   and here we have divid them up into the three digit level  and they are design by the    rs    on your chart   all tend to be clu  in the lower  left hand quadrant   that indic that these industri experienc loss in both employ and output share  on the other hand  if you turn to the next chart  label chart    you   ll see that there is not a strong relationship between the chang in employ share and the chang in product growth  there   s a mild  veri small negat relationship  it   s signific onli at the    percent level   and import  the underperform industri are not strong clu    there are a few outlier  which are most high tech servic industri   i must admit  though  that this analysi is somewhat incomplet sinc we have product data onli through       so  base on this analysi of these four underperform industri  what do i conclud  first  obvious  the weak labor market perform in this turnaround is more than explain by just a hand of industri   second  i tend to conclud that the slow growth of employ in these industri is due main to a negat demand shock   and not a posit suppli shock   at the industri level   negat demand shock at the level of the industri identifi  combin with the slow pace of overal job creation  have led to a larg pool of underutil resourc   so far  so good   but then the question is  what is the implic for polici   here  unfortun  thing get a lot more confus  some analyst would interpret this configur of relat demand shock as be equival to an aggreg negat suppli shock   a chang in the op  alloc of labor resourc across industri   unfortun  this type of aggreg negat suppli shock can be problemat and ambigu for the outlook for inflat and for monetari polici   on the one hand  it is possibl that the process of realloc labor resourc is particular sticki and reflect structur chang  which could confront us with some upsid risk   to put it anoth way  it   s possibl that the short term nairu could be somewhat higher than the long term nairu and  therefor  we could be confront some upsid risk of inflat   on the other side  it could well be that we have a veri larg pool of underutil resourc that will decreas onli veri slowli  and that phenomenon is perhap undermeasur by the unemploy rate   this is a point that i think governor bernank has made a few  e   and that would caus us to face the possibl of continu downsid pressur on inflat as household incom do not keep up  now  it   s a littl hard at this stage to know which of these risk will prevail   but i would say  if one look at the relat benign perform of unit labor cost and at other signal from the labor market more general  that it seem as though we aren   t realli confront the upsid risk   i think we   re more like confront the downsid risk   in either case  it seem to me that as we go forward  labor market indic broad defin   not just the unemploy rate but also job creation  unit labor cost  and other measur of both resourc util and cost pressur   are like to be a reason sign of econom health and also an import indic of emerg risk   therefor  i will continu to repeat the usual statement that ned   refer to  which is that i think our polici approach should be heavili influenc by incom data  with a particular eye on the broad rang of labor market develop  have said all that  i would also note that  like a few other in the room  i recogn that as we go forward we are go to be confront with the need to take a paus   i agre with ned to some degre in that the question of paus also give me some paus   but i   m also certain that as we get new data   and if we   re care about what we say   the market will soon come to recogn that their expect and our may not be fulli align   how this will get resolv  obvious i cannot forese  but i am realli quit comfort with the relat modest upward trend in the feder fund rate that is built into both the market and the  book forecast   thank you
mr  reinhart  thank you  mr  chairman     low is hand out some
materi i   ll be refer to   this was one of those intermeet period that serv to remind me of the ephemer natur of my work here   not long after the bluebook was distribut  the bureau of labor statist report that it found         new payrol job           in octob and back revis worth           and the document we struggl over would be read  or at least skim  in a differ light   in particular  the shift up of polici expect follow the employ report brought the net intermeet rise in feder fund futur rate  shown in the chart at the top left of exhibit    to    to    basi point   the   percent fund rate expect for the end of      is consist with the belief that you plan to tighten polici in   point increment at about half of the fomc meet between now and then as governor kohn note   i take that to mean that market particip have appar come to defin    measur    as    care calibr    rather than    regular and rhythmic      as for today  as shown in the middl left panel  respond to the desk   s survey of primari dealer univers predict that the committe will firm polici   point  will assess the risk to it goal as balanc  and will retain the    measur    languag in the statement   a minor of dealer still expect a marker in the statement indic that you   re like to paus in decemb in the process of remov polici accommod  although the number that actual expect such a paus dwindl after friday morn   the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix      with this revis to polici expect  the nomin treasuri yield shown at the top right gain    to    basi point over the intermeet period  with the largest increas post at shorter matur   but this should not be read as a tighten in financi market condit  as index debt yield fell  more broad  equiti price gain    percent  and the dollar depreci   percent against a basket of major currenc   fluctuat in oil price domin the chatter among particip in global financi market dure much of the period   although the price of west texa intermedi crude end ye day about    abov it level at the  e of the septemb meet  it vari in a     rang   there are three main channel of influenc of energi price on the economi   first  a rise in oil price make a direct arithmet contribut to consum price  which should be of concern primarili to the extent that it prompt an increas in under inflat expect   second  as the unit state is an oil import  a rise in price amount to an increas in an excis tax  which tend to restrain aggreg demand  third  sinc energi is a factor of product  an increas in it price tilt the product mix toward other input  lower their margin product  down the road  this lead to a lower level of labor compens   but given adjust cost  this latter effect emerg onli slowli over  e   in consequ  as long as inflat expect are well contain  market particip might expect policymak to focus main on the effect of energi price on aggreg demand   that an increas in oil price is associ with lower aggreg demand and henc with lower interest rate  as shown by the three bar chart in the bottom right of the exhibit  that seem to be what happen over the intermeet period  as governor bernank note   day to day chang in oil price were invers correl with share price and ten year treasuri yield   and statist signific so   moreov  inflat compens over the next five year  as deriv from the treasuri market  was not correl with oil price movement  at least at a daili frequenc   as discuss in the top left panel of your next exhibit  the case for firm polici today may rest on the view that econom data  includ solid gain in employ  the red bar   on balanc indic that financi condit are support a durabl econom expans   as those financi condit are predic on firm polici today  you may feel it appropri to valid those expect  you may also be concern that pressur on inflat may soon emerg   while longer term inflat compens  plot as the black line at the right  has been well contain  there has been a notabl updrift in the shorter term measur  the red line    as shown in the middl panel  rais the nomin fund rate to   percent today would put it at about the midpoint of the rang of standard polici prescript   as shown in the bottom panel  a   point hike would also turn the real feder fund rate more decid posit and rais it further abov the lower limit of es  of it equilibrium valu   the more difficult part of your decis would seem to be how to describ your futur action  which is the subject of the third exhibit   in the staff forecast  a varieti of factor combin to make it possibl to hold the fund rate at   percent for about one year without exhaust resourc slack and put upward pressur on inflat   even if you don   t anticip wait that long befor firm polici  you might see merit in contempl the possibl of sit on the sidelin in decemb and let the world know of that likelihood now   a paus would give you the opportun to assess the durabl of the expans   an opportun that might seem to be particular attract if some of the recent strength in spend has been borrow from next year in anticip of the end of partial expens   signal that intent would limit the risk that market particip  extrapol from four consecut tighten  mark up their rate expect inappropri   let me say a bit more about this point   the chart at the top right plot fomc rate decis over the past five year as hollow bar and shade the relat surpris  as judg from futur quot  from that action   be more explicit in your statement over the past year or so has allow market particip to peg precis the past three tighten   but it may also have led them to expect such guidanc go forward   in that case  silenc about a paus might veri well be taken as a signal that no such paus was be contempl   that said  you might  as discuss in the middl panel  view the    measur pace    languag as alreadi encompass enough scope to allow you to keep the fund rate at   percent in decemb if you see fit   the extent to which the outlook for polici has chang in the past few day may underscor the need to remain flexibl   inde  as shown by the probabl densiti function impli by option price at the right  market particip alreadi place a wide band of uncertainti around where the fund rate will be just six month from now  suggest that you alreadi have latitud in the pace with which you remov polici accommod without surpris market   altern  you might view yourselv as unlik to paus in decemb   as note at the bottom left  with oil price higher and the dollar weaker  inflat pressur may emerg relat quick   they could do so especi if we are in the midst of a slow in the rate of growth of structur product that will put upward pressur on unit labor cost   as plot at the bottom right  the four quarter growth rate of output per hour in the nonfarm busi sector  the black line  has turn down  wherea at the same  e  unit labor cost have pick up  the red line    as an altern scenario present in the  book attest  monetari polici choic will be much less attract should structur product growth ratchet down perman   for your refer  the last exhibit repeat the tabl of altern statement that staff circul on friday with one chang note in bold   consist with the view that the aggreg demand effect of the oil shock seem to have been relat more import  the phrase    despit the rise in energi price    has been move to refer to output growth   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   question for     presid
i just had a quick question   have we given some thought to whether by be clearer about what we expect to do in the futur we are  in effect  get inform back from the market that is what we told them  as oppos to what the market   s own expect are  do we know what the market think with regard to the need  in this case  for an increas in interest rate   or are we involv in a self fulfil situat here where we are clear and  therefor  the market say     the fed is say this  so we   re go to give them back the same inform they   re give us     without a lot of ad market intellig
that   s the revers of what we use to talk about as    look in the mirror     that was the issu of whether we were be guid by market signal becaus  if the market was guid by our signal  then again there was this posit feedback question   also one worri that market particip are not invest independ in the effort to forecast the economi and to decid what is the appropri monetari polici   in that regard  i think a good exampl is not this intermeet period but the prior two where data came out that seem to suggest that aggreg demand would be weaker than previous thought   market particip didn   t chang their view of the monetari polici action over the next five month becaus the committe   s statement seem to suggest that you would be remov polici accommod  everyth that move was at a further ahead  e horizon   so the whole structur of the term structur of fed fund futur rate shift down past four or five month out  wherea the near term track of tighten seem to be bake in the cake  that said  volatil are low  but market particip seem to understand the condit natur of the committe   s decis   in support of that notion  as we   ve note in past brief  impli volatil are low but the reaction to surpris in the data have been much larger than in the prior decad   so if you look at the reaction to surpris in the employ report or consum price  you see that market are repric their expect for polici action   there just seem to be less idiosyncrat nois about where polici will be
further question   if not  let me get start   we are see what appear to be the first indic in this committe of an increas varianc of opinion which  if you go back over the previous meet  you will find was virtual nonexist   the reason that our opinion are onli now begin to spread is that the polici stanc we   ve taken over the last year or two has been veri unusu   dure this period  we have had a veri substanti and surpris growth in product  which drove unit labor cost down and creat a view that inflat had veri littl probabl of emerg   therefor we could be fair well convinc that a low fund rate  a high accommod fund rate  could be maintain for quit a signific period of  e   as a result  our general polici and the varieti of terminolog that we began to use  includ    patient    and    consider period     becam the central mantra of this committe  i think that period is come to an end   it   s not that we sudden found some extraordinari capabl to communic to the market our view  which would then craft their general expect   it   s that the last coupl of year were a veri special and unusu period and not like to be continu into the futur   we   re go to move back  i suspect  far closer to our more general posit  which at one point was that we never project the futur  we mere tri to give a sens of the balanc of risk   that assess often didn   t convey veri much becaus we didn   t behav as though we realli view it as a project  we respond larg to the data as they evolv   my suspicion is that we   re move back in that direct  and we   re begin to see the reason for that in the context of structur product gain  if  inde  structur product growth is    percent and if the general respons of the wage market to the unemploy rate continu where it is  we will end up with  as the project in fact impli  a   percent increas in compens per hour and around    percent for the core inflat rate   were we abl confid to project that indefinit into the futur  we could be fair well convinc that inflat will be contain  the onli problem is that our abil to make judgment about separ cyclic from structur output per hour chang is question or  i would say  modest at best   this issu is come forward  for exampl  in the context of the slowdown in high tech invest  which a number of peopl have mention   now  if there is  inde  a slowdown in high tech invest or  as the vice chair of the board of governor indic public  if the slower rate of declin in high tech price is suggest a reduct in the extent to which the high tech area is contribut to product  then we have to ask where we should place the long term product number   and what is our confid level for that number   it   s quit like at this stage that    percent may well be the right number   i say that in part becaus  despit the         increas in employ in octob  if you examin the hire less separ  which theoret should be come from the same data sourc  that seri is show a smoother trend of gradual declin in the rate of job gain  the latest data we have on that obvious are for septemb   that seri show less volatil than the payrol number but  on averag  is not terribl differ from the payrol seri sinc the begin of the year  both indic a gradual slow   if that were  inde  the trend  then the product outlook is better   if it is not and we are look at an acceler of employ  then chanc are we are get closer to a level of structur product growth that is lower than    percent  now  the reason i rais this issu is that  although we may choos    as our number  the argument that    may actual be what we   re look at is not readili dismiss   make the distinct between what is happen short term in output per hour and what is happen to under product is veri difficult   inde  the data for the numer of output per hour come from a sourc wholli differ from that of the denomin   i think we felt a sens of comfort that a good part of the product growth had to be structur when we had this veri high rate of growth   that was almost certain the case becaus the number were so high   as a result  what we were observ was definit downward pressur on inflat  to the point in fact where we were at the edg of be realli quit concern about the onset of deflat   that is no longer the case  and i think we   re begin to confront problem that realli bring us back to the way we use to do forecast  which had much wider area of varianc   clear  the varianc of the view of this group is begin to reflect that  earlier we discuss the issu of the dollar   we   re not sure exact how to translat the exchang rate into unit import cost   inde  for those of us who were in basel the last coupl of day  the startl new piec of inform was that the fascin declin in the rate of pass through of exchang rate into unit import price  a declin that is progress in the unit state at a fair remark pace  is exact what they are find in the unit kingdom  accord to mervyn king at the bank of england   when he rais that point and i mention our find on that  everybodi look around  and there was general agreement that we were all see the same phenomenon   it all start  as you may recal  in the failur of the devalu in brazil and argentina to creat increas inflat  which they did not   someth veri unusu is go on with respect to the exchang rate translat issu   and this is obvious a veri import question for how we view currenc depreci and inflat and  therefor  what the implic are for monetari polici  we have veri signific problem with privat save   the household save rate has come down veri dramat and now is close to zero   we have to resist the notion that there   s some floor at zero  which the save rate can   t go below  and that therefor it must flatten and turn up   the idea of have a negat person save rate is not out of line with the way the world work   rememb  the averag household   not look at the book valu of it equiti hold  which is what the save rate is   the averag household look at the market valu   and we can readili have  as our data have shown in the past  a negat save rate with a signific part of the popul believ that they are save at a fair pronounc rate  which has been the experi of recent year   we don   t know how that is go to come out  we do know that australia  as i understand it  has had a negat save rate for a while  our flow of fund account here do not show a negat save rate  but they indic that almost all of the chang in the save rate in the last decad has been in the upper quintil of the incom distribut  and there it is driven veri substanti by asset valu   peopl in the upper quintil look at the market valu of what they own   adjust their save behavior in respons to the book valu of their net worth would never enter anybodi   s mind   henc  this is a synthet number  and let   s be care not to presum veri much about what it is tell us  the fiscal issu is veri critic becaus it is the onli issu in which polici per se has a clear posit contribut to make   it is go to be veri interest to see how this play out   i must say that i   ve turn a littl op ist in the last week or so listen to some of the administr peopl in this respect   i   m not sure whether it will translat into someth of signific or whether in fact  ned  as you put it     we all know how like    that is  when it come to polici  with the increas uncertainti that we have about how the econom situat is evolv  we have to acknowledg to ourselv that our forecast is go to be wrong   it alway is   we expect it to be wrong   the question is  where do we want to take the risk   if we project continu low core inflat becaus of a    percent project for structur product growth and that growth is in fact at   percent or less  inflat expect will rise  bond yield will rise  and asset price will fall  as  of cours  will the dollar in that context   we could face problem of balanc sheet loss if the chang is rapid   our abil to separ cyclic from structur chang in output per hour  as i said befor  is modest at best   should inflat expect rise  the higher the fund rate  the better posit monetari polici will be in to address unexpect inflat increas  if we signal today a paus for decemb  the ten year note yield will declin  engend an even larger correct should under inflat unexpect rise in the month ahead  capit gain do not impair balanc sheet   capit loss do  howev  especi if they are rapid  if rate move up and the economi slow  the ten year yield will declin and possibl equiti price as well  but balanc sheet will not be impair   the structur damag obvious would be quit limit in that regard   should the economi weaken  of cours  we alway have the option of move rate lower  it strike me  therefor  that even if we believ the risk are symmetr with respect to how the economi is go to emerg  a cost   benefit analysi of the consequ of our take various action lead me to conclud that we would be far better posit today not onli to move    basi point but also to signal noth about decemb   the best thing that can happen is for the market to perceiv that we are impli anoth rate increas in decemb becaus the further beyond the   percent rang and into a posit real rate that we can get  the better off i think we will be  i want to repeat that we don   t know veri much about the interact of veri larg product gain  wage rate  unit labor cost  and the nairu   we   ve been experienc these gain onli in recent year   i person would feel a lot more comfort if the feder fund rate were back in a rang that is consist with much of our histor data rather than on the edg of a number of our econometr function of how the economi work   the edg are signific in the overal pictur  but i wonder how much emphasi we can put on the outer edg   their signific depend on whether or not the function are bend in one way or anoth  whether they are still linear  or what their natur is at those point   therefor  overal  i think we are far better posit to get the fund rate up as fast as we can this year and then recogn that we have  e to discuss paus as we get into next year   now  in the decemb meet we may want to suggest a paus for februari    which i guess would be the particular day of the meet   that will veri much depend on what is evolv   if  for exampl  the weak in the high tech area continu into next year  i   m not sure how to read that   if it say that we   re get much less in the way of technolog advanc  it suggest that the product growth rate is lower   if it is suggest that capit invest is go to slow  we get a potenti declin in the outlook for real gdp  how we should play this is go to depend veri much on how these number evolv  and at this particular stage  i think that we have to start prepar for a communic transit as we get into the earli week and month of next year   we do have our semiannu report on monetari polici in which to make a veri broad statement   but we may have to decid someth in decemb about how we want to posit ourselv for februari  especi if  as now seem like  we move anoth    point in decemb  what i   d like to propos is that we move    basi point today and have a statement that is as littl chang as possibl  so we seem neutral with respect to the move we might or might not make in decemb   then we can proceed to observ how the data evolv over the next number of week   it is veri unlik to turn out that an upward move in decemb will be inappropri and yet the market will not have made that judgment alreadi   if we deem a move in decemb inappropri  it will be becaus of the type of evid that will move the feder fund rate and inde the whole financi structur   so the concern that we would have about move in a manner that would shock the market would not be relev   i don   t think that is go to be a problem  but i do think we have to start think of the word    measur    as have a fair short life expect   we have to begin to reflect on how to approach our communic in a way that will be more consist with an increas varianc of opinion in this committe in come month  as i think is go to be the case   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend   i want to say  notwithstand your comment on product  with which i don   t disagre  that the fact is that the real fed fund rate today is zero   i   d be more inclin to the view that we need to paus if the real fed fund rate were in fact posit   or to put it anoth way if the nomin rate were in the     to   percent rang  which is what i think you may be suggest   so as long as the rate is below what i would consid a reason  neutral rate   and zero fit that criterion   then i don   t think we should be paus   that   s not to say that we should move everi  e we meet next year   i realiz that   s not the case   but i think the rate need to be at a posit level  as you   re suggest   in my view  the discuss at our meet in februari of next year will be import  and i think chang the languag at that point will be import as well
mayb we ought to circul the potenti statement so that  if you find that ani of the languag is inconsist with your view  you can comment on it   whi don   t we do that   it   s the one label b     peopl may misinterpret what is actual be propos  so let   s not leav that to chanc   presid
thank you veri much   i   m in strong agreement with what you have propos  mr  chairman  both the move of    basi point and the select of the languag that   not attempt to signal anyth for decemb   i understand the logic in the  book   we in boston have the same kind of perspect about the futur   so i realiz that there is an identifi   mayb even baselin   probabl that even with a relat flat fed fund rate over the next year or so  we   ll still have an output gap   i recogn all that econom logic   but my basic instinct say that we need to get out of the zero zone on the real fed fund rate and to a posit rate for ani number of reason  which you   ve done a better job of touch on than i ever could  i also would like to say that i think our use of languag over the last year or so was prompt by a set of extraordinari circumst   whether one view those circumst as relat to the extraordinari product perform or to the unusu market volatil when deflat concern were veri promin  we need to do someth to calm thing down   we did calm thing down for a good period of  e   i realli feel that in our communic we now need to move back to someth that say what we did  whi we did it  mayb give some perspect on the balanc of risk  and leav it at that   whether we move there in decemb or in februari   or in march  april  or may of next year   i don   t care  but i   d like us to move there   to be explicit  i   d get rid of paragraph     thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend both for the increas in the fund rate and the statement   i   d like to offer just a coupl of other observ  the reason the communic process is so import is that it   s high desir that the market and the feder reserv read incom data the same way and that the interpret is a correct assess of the signific of the incom data   that   s not so easi to do but  as cathi   point out earlier  we certain don   t want to run the risk that the market   s assess is simpli flow from what we have said about futur polici action  which when we get to the point of take action may not reflect our own assess of the data that have come in   i think that the statement will have to evolv  as you suggest  i   d also like to mention that i think the greater divers of view around the tabl reflect the fact that the probabl distribut of where we   re go to go has becom consider more spread out   or i   ll state it this way   my own probabl distribut is consider more spread out   if i think about where we were six month ago  i thought it was extraordinarili unlik that we were go to remain at   percent on the fund rate   but my own view of where we   re go to go has becom more spread out  and where we   re go to end up six month from now  i think  is go to depend much more on the data that we get in the next six month than anyth that i can now put into my forecast   so i think that that diverg of view probabl reflect each one of us becom more uncertain as to where we   re go to go
a diverg of both the mean and the aggreg varianc  governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend on both the    basi point move today and also languag that  sn   t hint veri much one way or the other about futur polici   there are a coupl of other thing i   d like to add  though   one is that i don   t want to forget what exhibit   in     s present show or what presid   talk about  which is that  if we move to   percent today  we are well up into the rang of es  equilibrium real rate histor   so while  yes  the rate is low  let   s not get ourselv too wrap up in the thought that we are outsid an accept rang   we may be in the low part of it  but we seem to be in the rang  second  obvious have thought about this issu of a slowdown in product and in high tech invest   i   ve talk about it here and public   i   d make a coupl of other point  one is that what we do with respect to the possibl of a slow of product growth depend veri much on how quick the market pick it up and it is reflect in asset price and other thing  if  in fact  the market  sn   t pick this up and if asset price continu to rise inappropri  we have to do someth to slow aggreg demand down to the new expect of slower increas in aggreg suppli   on the other hand  if the market pick it up relat quick  asset price won   t move up as quick  aggreg demand won   t be out of line  and we still may be in a mode where we want to rais rate for a varieti of reason  but we may not feel as press becaus of the product uncertainti you talk about   so i think in both case we need to recogn the probabl direct  but i at least am still veri much open mind  as i think presid pool suggest we should be  about the pace at which we   re go to move in this direct   in essenc  i don   t think that the market necessarili has it wrong  nor do i think that the  book has it wrong either   so i am veri much of a pragmat view about what our polici stanc next year might be
mr  chairman  i support your recommend to increas the fund rate    basi point  but i am concern about adopt the propos statement   when i open the bluebook this  e  i was actual pleas to see in altern b what i thought was a well craft statement that hint at a possibl paus in a way that was rather art and subtl  without foreclos ani option in the futur whatsoev   and i thought the reason in the bluebook in support of    b    was strong and convinc   as   state  both befor and after the employ report  market particip expect some hint in the statement of a possibl paus  after we receiv the employ report  there was an updat to the bluebook that contain altern b   as the propos statement   so i took b   as a respons to the employ report  and to my mind that was an unwarr shift   i would note that the  book assess of the appropri path for the fund rate had not chang as a consequ of the employ report   but we observ a larg and  if the  book is right  excess market respons to the employ report   we saw that in the immedi move in the fed fund futur   i suppos if one interpret the employ report as a veri strong signal   and perhap this is the view that you were express   that structur product growth is lower than we had been assum  then this b   statement would be an appropri respons   but it seem to me that the  book has alreadi incorpor an expect declin in product growth   i suppos in the  book the declin is cyclic not structur  but it is built into the  book forecast   the employ report simpli confirm what the staff had earlier been expect when they had been surpris by the low employ growth   so it seem to me that adopt b   reinforc the market expect about the futur path of monetari polici in a way that i would not like to see it reinforc   my own prefer would be to move today but to adopt altern b rather than b  
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend in all part   i   m mad look around for the sentenc that   is refer to  and i can   t find it
it   s the first sentenc that relat to altern b   the veri top one
oh  they   re put in a refer to the cumul increas
in other word  by stipul how much we have done alreadi  it suggest that that may be enough
right   so i   m for b      the statement that was pass out   but i agre with some combin of the view express by    cathi  and you that soon we should chang this sentenc that say  with inflat expect to be low     the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur      at some level  that statement is inoffens and all inclus  but the problem is that the more we move up    point per meet  the more we defin what measur is   we   ve now done that four  e  so we are code that sentenc  and we probabl have to chang it pretti soon   i wouldn   t want to chang it this  e  i have at least some hawkish element in my head  as you heard befor   i think next  e may be the  e to chang the sentenc in a way that undo the code we have given it
i support the two part of your recommend  mr  chairman   i think altern b   is prefer to b   i appreci your observ on the divers around the tabl  and i think presid pool is correct that it   s becaus each of us has a wider distribut in our head regard what is like to happen   we   re just talk about where our mean is  i guess  or mayb where our insecur are   in realiti  my thought is that there is a good deal of uncertainti on both side  as i point out in my formal comment   there is uncertainti on the weak side as well as the strong side  for the reason you note   accord  i think it is  e for us to look at this languag issu again   we enjoy it so much the first  e  and the second  and the third    laughter
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the recommend of b     it seem to me that there is no need to chang the languag  at least at this point  becaus i think market particip understand the condit natur of what   s go on here   so in that sens  i think we   re posit rather well   i remain open as to when we may want to chang the languag and how we may want to chang it  but for now i think we   re still reason well posit
mr  chairman  i support your recommend to increas the fed fund rate by    basi point   on the languag question  i think it is  e to start move away from the term    measur      it has work well   quit frank  better than i thought it would   i was concern about it when we start use a seri of forward look statement   so i would like to move away from the forward look statement   obvious not at this meet  but possibl at the decemb meet   at the same  e  howev  we should also serious consid the balanc of risk statement that we had previous   after two task forc work on this with roger    i   m not go to suggest a third task forc   but the balanc of risk languag has evolv over the ten year that i   ve been here   it has been use at  e  but i think it is get increas difficult to craft a balanc of risk statement  given the complex of the economi
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend  i have just two comment   one is that i think you overst a bit the idea that the current fund rate is outsid the rang of histor experi   as presid pool note  it   s not so unusu in real term
i   m sorri   i was refer to the   percent
oh  the   percent  okay   i don   t think there   s a basi to move just on an allergi to a   percent fund rate  i think it should be base on the data and on the economi   i would just note addit that the economi respond most direct to overal financi condit  and there i don   t think we   re anywher close to the border of what has been experienc in histori  my second comment is on communic   as everyon know  i disagre with presid    i think we should be tri to provid guidanc   in my view it has work veri well the last coupl of year   i don   t think it was surpris that it work well   precis becaus we are assess such complex matter   for exampl  we   re tri to assess the cours of product   it   s veri difficult for the market to read our mind   we need to provid some kind of guidanc  whether it   s condit or whatev it may be  i think we should   i   m person comfort with drop the    measur    languag or modifi the languag  but i hope we do not go back to a complet uninform statement  at least without some thorough discuss of what the option might be   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend  rais the fund rate and keep the statement essenti as it was last  e   i also hope we reconsid the languag in decemb   to some extent i may have a differ focus than some other who want to do that   i hope we leav open the possibl that we could paus from need to move   that we   re not lock in to tighten at each meet   my concern about    measur    and about the current languag is that it   seem to lock us in one meet ahead  but i don   t think it has realli constrain the market when it look much beyond the next coupl meet   i think we see that we   re get good feedback from the market  our    measur    languag hasn   t impair that feedback except for the veri short term matur becaus market particip see our announc as trigger the next action   so i believ we need to think about how to do this in decemb  if we   re go to keep an open mind for februari   if we remov    measur     i hope we don   t do so in a way that suggest we   re on an even steeper upward track and our pace of tighten is not go to be measur   i don   t think that   s consist with the econom outlook   you seem to impli that the inflat risk were quit skew becaus of the product risk  and i admit that product growth may be slower than we had anticip   the staff has a slowdown built into the  book and it could
i   m not say that   i   m say that the cost of a mistak in polici is skew  which is a differ statement   i   m acknowledg that the probabl distribut is symmetr on the outcom of the event  but the cost   benefit analysi on a mistak is not
perhap   i think there is a cost to be too high as well as be too low
mayb the cost of be too high is that we have a more sluggish economi with fewer peopl put back to work and too low an inflat rate if some of these upsid risk to inflat don   t occur   so i think there are cost on both side here   if we take out    measur     i hope we give some sens  even if it   s a balanc of risk sentenc  of our assess look forward  as governor bernank said   i hope we don   t induc peopl to rais intermedi  and long term rate by a consider amount becaus they think we   re no longer go to be measur in remov polici accommod   i think that would be a problem  given the outlook   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i also am in strong agreement with your recommend both to increas the fed fund rate and on the statement   my think on how we would remov our accommod has evolv over the past few month  along the line that presid pool has alreadi articul  and i   m just not certain when a paus may be necessari   so i am support of languag that give us that flexibl   and i was encourag by     s comment that some market particip do think that the current languag give us that flexibl  so i   m in support of your recommend
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support both part of the recommend  with respect to the statement  i also think it is appropri at this  e to make as littl chang in the statement as is necessari  for a coupl of reason   first of all  the market understand that the absenc of chang is not a result of inattent  they know it is the net result of a great deal of thought and consider   so ani chang whatsoev is interpret  and occasion over interpret  and i don   t think we are at the point yet where we need to open that possibl  with respect to communic in the futur  i   m with governor bernank   i don   t think we can go back to communic in the fashion that we were do even a year ago   i think we have set an expect that we will make a real effort to communic some of our under sens of what   s happen with the economi  and i think we will be call on to continu that trend
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  includ the languag
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend  includ the languag  for this meet  but i do share some of the concern that sever of my colleagu around the tabl have express   i think some of the languag may not be seen as particular consist with our polici of improv communic   if the word are seen as boilerpl everi  e  in a way it may take away from our flexibl go forward   so at the decemb meet  i   d like us to look at some altern   if the word    measur    continu to be part of our statement  i think  as other have said  it will end up tie our hand  anoth part of the statement is the second sentenc  in which we   ve talk about this    robust under growth in product      we saw in the      s that we move to a differ level of long term product growth  but as i said in my comment  we may be in a part of this busi cycl or stage of the recoveri when product growth is go to look weaker   we need to think about how that is word   i think that languag could rais some question about what product we are focus on   the long term versus the cyclic   if product turn out to be weaken  as the forecast in the  book lay out   so as the recoveri continu to move forward  there are aspect of the statement that we have to be care about in term of leav in some of the languag for such a long period of  e   we need to think through and begin to anticip prior to a meet how to make those kind of chang in order to give us flexibl
i agre with your propos  mr  chairman  about rais the rate and about the statement   my own sens is that the fund rate is more like to lie on the path of the market   s forecast than that in the  book  and i don   t think it   s the right  e to pull down the yield curv   with regard to our statement  i agre with governor bernank that we shouldn   t be look to turn back the hand of  e and increas the varianc in the market   s forecast for the futur fed fund rate
i support your recommend   i wish i knew what i thought about the desir statement    laughter   i would just point out not onli that the market now expect us to slow the pace of increas signific from what we   ve been do but also that the minut from our last meet have some nice art languag near the end   which is probabl relev to some of the concern mani of you express   say that the market has not misinterpret us as signal a steadi reflex march up at    basi point per meet   i think the minut are help against that risk of be misinterpret  and i look forward to a discuss about the futur structur of the statement in decemb and beyond  speaker      you may be the onli one    laughter
