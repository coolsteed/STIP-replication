good morn  everybodi   we start with the desk oper  bill
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the handout with the blue on the front   the market turbul that began in earnest on februari    is now a distant memori   risk appetit have recov  volatil in the fix incom and equiti market has declin  and the u s  equiti market has climb to a new high   exhibit       and   show the correl matric for the daili price and yield movement in the fix incom  equiti  and currenc market   the blue shade box indic correl with an absolut valu greater than       as shown in exhibit    until februari     the correl across most of these asset pair were low   howev  begin on februari    through mid to late march  correl rose sharpli as risk reduct effort domin financi market   this shift can be seen in exhibit    where all but one of the box are shade blue   sinc the march fomc meet  calm has return  with asset price movement again becom most uncorrel   the matrix shown in exhibit    which show the correl sinc the march fomc meet  look similar to exhibit     as i mention in my brief at the march meet  although the turmoil in the market was relat most to risk reduct effort  in certain area   the subprim mortgag market is the best exampl   the deterior in perform was relat most to fundament develop   as can be seen in exhibit   and    which plot delinqu and loss for the notori      subprim vintag  the deterior in perform has continu apac   exhibit   show that delinqu of more than sixti day for the      vintag are even higher than those for the      vintag   this is noteworthi becaus in      the u s  economi experienc a mild recess and payrol employ was declin   even more noteworthi is the trend of loss for the      vintag   as shown in exhibit    loss for the      vintag are run at about tripl the rate of the      vintag   this poor loss experi appear due both to deterior in underwrit standard and to less favor under condit   for exampl  the soften trend of home price in mani local market   the fundament deterior in the subprim mortgag sector can also be seen in other measur of perform   for exampl  exhibit   illustr the behavior of bbb rate spread for the abx  cds  and cash market   the abx repres an index of twenti credit default swap on twenti bbb rate asset back secur  and the bbb cash index repres the yield spread on the bbb rate tranch of the asset back secur   thus  the abx index refer  via the credit default swap market  the under asset back secur market   as can be seen in this exhibit  although all three spread have recov somewhat over the past few week  spread    materi use by mr    is append to this transcript  appendix     remain much wider than earlier in the year   also  note that abx spread remain consider wider than the cds and cash spread that they refer   this situat underscor the illiquid of the abx market and may partial reflect the lack of a natur constitu of investor who might wish to take the long side of this index  especi when the subprim market is under stress   the problem in subprim mortgag have spill over into the collater debt oblig  cdo  market   as you may recal  mani cdos have a substanti proport of their asset in lower rate subprim asset back secur tranch   after widen sharpli in late februari  the yield spread on mezzanin structur financ cdos have shown no recoveri   in fact  as shown in exhibit    the spread on these cdos have continu to widen   at the last fomc meet  i argu that the selloff in the equiti market that began in late februari had at least one fundament compon   the reduct in earn expect for        yet the equiti market has recov quit strong   i think that this can be explain by three factor   first  earn in the first quarter were stronger than expect   the board staff es  that first quarter earn for the s p     will have increas about   percent on a year over year basi   second  perhap as a result  earn expect have stabil   as shown in exhibit    the median bottom up equiti analyst forecast for s p     earn growth in      has stop fall and remain abov   percent   third  buyout and buyback activ continu unab   exhibit   show the flow of fund data on net equiti issuanc  as can be seen  the outstand suppli of u s  equiti is shrink rapid  in contrast to the increas in net suppli that occur over the         period   buyout and buyback may also be a factor explain the recent behavior of corpor credit spread   as shown in exhibit     high yield and emerg market debt spread have most recov sinc the late februari widen   howev  invest grade debt spread remain wider than in earli        invest grade debt perform may be lag becaus investor fear that the credit qualiti of this debt will be undermin as buyout and buyback result in increas leverag   turn now to the currenc market  an emerg stori is the weak of the u s  dollar   as shown in exhibit     the dollar has fallen about   percent against the euro sinc the start of the year and is virtual flat against the yen over this period  the weak against the euro appear to reflect most chang interest rate expect   exhibit    plot the spread between the june      eurodollar contract and the euribor contract   as can be seen in this exhibit  the expect interest rate differenti has fallen about    basi point this year   as this has occur  the euro has strengthen   to date  the dollar   s weak has not been of much concern to market particip   the declin has been gradual  and investor perceiv that global imbal are unwind smooth   nevertheless  the subprim debacl point to anoth sourc of risk for the dollar   in recent year  the net acquisit of dollar denomin financi asset by foreign investor has shift to privat flow from public flow and to corpor bond  includ asset back secur and cdo oblig  from treasuri and agenc debt   this shift is shown in exhibit      my worri here is that the problem in the subprim and alt a mortgag market could ul  affect foreign investor    appetit for u s  asset back secur and cdos   for exampl  a particular poor perform of lower rate ab and cdo tranch  coupl with the widespread corpor rate downgrad that might be associ with such poor perform  could caus foreign investor to lose confid in invest in dollar denomin debt   in term of u s  interest rate expect  investor expect no near term chang in polici   howev  market particip continu to expect signific eas late this year and in        interest rate expect for the remaind of      are back where they were at the  e of the januari fomc meet   look at the feder fund rate futur market in exhibit     we can see that onli about one    basi point rate cut is expect in        in contrast  expect for      more close resembl expect at the  e of the decemb and march fomc meet  not the januari meet   as can be seen in exhibit     which plot eurodollar futur contract yield  investor expect substanti monetari polici eas in        whi this delay pattern of eas   there are three potenti explan   first  as i have note befor  futur market yield reflect the mean  not the modal  forecast   to the extent that investor perceiv a moder risk of signific econom weak that could lead to pronounc monetari polici eas  then the yield in the futur market could be well below the modal forecast of investor   second  some investor may disagre with the fomc about the outlook   in this case  they might anticip that it will take  e for the fomc to come around to their way of think   lead to rate cut that occur onli later   third  some investor may anticip that inflat will moder   as this happen  the fomc might gradual reduc it nomin feder fund rate target follow lower inflat   essenti keep the real feder fund rate constant   final  the survey of the primari dealer show littl chang in interest rate expect sinc the last fomc meet   exhibit    and    compar dealer expect with market expect befor the march fomc meet and befor this meet   the horizont bold line repres market expect   the blue circl repres the differ dealer forecast  and the size of a circl repres how mani dealer have that forecast   the   circl repres the averag dealer forecast for each period   the averag of the primari dealer forecast is consist with onli slight more than    basi point of eas through the end of this year   not much differ from what is price into the feder fund futur market   as can be seen  the dispers of the dealer forecast over the next few quarter has narrow a bit   howev  consider disagr remain about whether short term rate will be higher or lower a year ahead   also  the averag of the dealer forecast for      remain consider abov market expect   this presum reflect main the    downsid risk    notion  which should caus the modal forecast of dealer to be higher than the mean expect repres by futur price   i   ll be happi to take ani question   i will need approv for domest oper  there were no foreign oper  also  i circul a memo ask you to vote to approv renew of the swap line to canada and mexico
okay   question   presid
i have two question   on page    when you talk about subprim paper  do we have ani data that can tell us anyth about the stress in the alt a market specif
there is definit some spillov into alt a  but alt a delinqu and loss are a fraction of subprim   if you compar the characterist of alt a loan with those of subprim loan  you   ll see the same eas of underwrit standard in the alt a market that occur in the subprim market and almost ident characterist of the underwrit standard except for one differ   the fico score   the fico score for alt a is much higher  appar  the fico score is pretti import becaus the loss for alt a are a fraction of those on subprim   but there are data that show some spillov
my second question regard s p earn   is there a way to split out what come from the rest of the world and what come from the unit state   i know it would be analyt difficult  but i   m just wonder if there is a dispar between the two in what drop to the bottom line
i   m sure there is a dispar between the two   i do not know of ani way to break that out clear   one factor   the weak of the dollar versus the euro   is definit help to boost corpor earn   a disproportion share of u s  foreign activ is europ orient  so it   s a bigger share than would be suggest by the european share of global gdp  that factor is definit help to support our earn   i have never seen ani data on that  we   ll look into it to see if there   s anyth  but i   m not hope
thank  bill
are there other question   we need a vote to ratifi domest open oper
pass without object   we also need a vote on the swap line
we   ve discuss this in the past   the swap line serv part a diplomat function  and they have some relev to potenti financi crise  if they   re need for dollar liquid either in canada or in mexico   howev  i will bring these up with secretari paulson at some point just to make sure that the treasuri is awar of what we   re do   whether we need to expand them or reduc them   so we   ve had a motion without object   okay  then the swap line are approv   let   s turn now to the econom situat  dave
thank you  mr  chairman   in this forecast round  you  as policymak  were face with an identif problem similar to that which we  as econometrician  so often confront   although the  book forecast is essenti the same as it was in march  sever observ equival hypothes could explain this outcom   first  abject lazi on the part of the staff  second  brilliant prescienc on our part  or third  what i assum is your work null hypothesi   dumb luck    laughter   well  i can assur you that abject lazi can be rule out  it took much agon  endless meet  and a lot of hard work to do noth   we are  after all  still part of the feder govern    laughter   as for prescienc and luck  they did combin to leav the outlook pretti much as it was at the  e of the last  book   we still believ that the economi has been grow at a pace less than it potenti  held down by the ongo slump in hous activ   as the drag from residenti invest abat  growth of real output is expect to pick up   but that reacceler of activ is limit by a diminish impetus to consum spend from hous wealth and a reason restrict monetari polici   let me begin by cite a few area of the forecast in which develop have unfold much as we had anticip   i   ll then move on to some of the area of notabl surpris that luckili had offset effect on the outlook   first  the bea   s advanc es  of real gdp in the first quarter show an increas of    percent that was close to our forecast both on the total and in the particular   as expect  the declin in residenti invest took a signific bite out of first quarter growth  as did net export and defens spend   outlay for equip were also quit soft  we view the meager gain in real gdp post in the first quarter as exagger the weak earli this year   in particular  we are anticip defens spend to bounc back in the second quarter to a level more consist with appropri  and we expect net export to larg revers their first quarter drop   as a consequ  we are project real gdp to advanc at a pace of a bit more than     percent in the second quarter   smooth through the temporari up and down  we believ that the economi probabl has been expand at a pace of about   percent in the first half of this year  the same rate that we had project in the march  book   a second major piec of our stori that appear to be receiv support from the incom data is our forecast that consumpt growth would slow notic   a project step down in the growth of consumpt is an import reason that in our forecast  even as the hous contract eventu wane  growth in real gdp remain below the pace of it potenti   although it is far too earli to claim victori  consum spend on good has flatten out in recent month after sharp increas at the turn of the year   the shallow trajectori of spend as we move into the second quarter  a lower level of real dispos incom  and sluggish chain store sale suggest that our forecast of   percent growth of real pce in the current quarter is within comfort reach   howev  i would like it note for the record that i am not character this as a    slam dunk       laughter   a third key element of our stori in the last  book was that  even though equip outlay had weaken over the past few quarter  we did not believ that this weak was the front edg of a more serious retrench in capit spend  in that regard  we receiv a bit of reassur from an upturn in the shipment of nondefens capit good in march and an even larger jump in new order for these good   those data suggest that high tech invest remain on a solid uptrend  wherea invest outsid high tech and transport seem pois for a modest upturn in the second quarter after sizabl declin over the preced six month   as expect  purchas of heavi truck remain the area of most notabl weak  needless to say  the data for invest are so volatil that we remain cautious about conclud that the downsid risk to capit spend has abat much   but given our recent track record in this area  you might consid it good news when the staff report no news   a fourth element of our stori that  at least for now  seem to be pan out is that the inventori overhang that emerg in the second half of last year would be work off relat smooth  rather than cumul into someth more serious  in the motor vehicl sector  steep product cut in the second half of last year and earli this year  coupl with a moder pace of sale  have brought day    suppli of light vehicl down to comfort level   inde  the automak have schedul some increas in product in the current quarter   outsid motor vehicl  manufactur appear to have adjust product reason prompt to the unintend buildup of stock   inde  manufactur ip exclud motor vehicl declin at an annual rate of     percent in the fourth quarter and increas onli a paltri   percent in the first quarter   some book valu measur of inventori sale ratio remain elev  but measur of day    suppli from our flow of good system have shown an improv that parallel report from purchas manag of fewer inventori problem among their custom   moreov  factori output increas sharpli in march  and the avail physic product data and the read from the labor market report point to anoth sizabl increas in april   so the evid seem to suggest that the inventori correct is abat   i should note that ye day   s figur on wholesal inventori in march came in below what was assum by the bea in the advanc es  of gdp   all els be equal  those data suggest a downward revis in first quarter real gdp growth of about   percentag point   in respons  we   d probabl add a similar amount to our second quarter es  of real gdp   final  anoth central element of our forecast has been that labor demand would slow in lag respons to the downshift in the growth of overal activ   we have been counsel patienc in the face of data in this area that persist surpris us to the upsid   last week   s labor market report provid at least a shred of evid in support of our stori   privat payrol increas        in april  and there was a downward revis of        in februari   leav the level of employ below that incorpor in the may  book   gain in privat payrol have averag about        per month over the past three month  and we expect that pace to be maintain over the remaind of the quarter   the unemploy rate increas to     percent last month  also in line with our project   put these piec togeth  we are feel a bit more confid of our stori that activ is increas at a subpar   percent pace in the first half of the year   we are also a bit less worri about the upsid risk pose by labor demand and consumpt and about the downsid risk pose by invest spend and inventori   but just a bit less worri   our longer term outlook has chang littl as well   we have revis down our forecast for the growth of real gdp this year by     percentag point  to   percent  and revis up our forecast for      by a similar amount  to     percent   i would like to argu that these veri small adjust are a testament to our prescienc  but i   ll have to admit that we seem to have benefit more from dumb luck   in brief  the negat consequ of a weaker outlook for hous activ and higher project oil price were just about offset by the posit effect of higher equiti price and a lower foreign exchang valu of the dollar   turn first to the hous market  the surpris has not been in actual construct activ  where start have exceed our expect a bit   rather  the real news has been on home sale   in particular  the sale of new home   not onli did new home sale drop in march to a level below our expect  sale were revis down in the preced month as well   as a consequ  the month    suppli of unsold new home has move up sharpli further in recent month instead of tip down as we had earlier expect   moreov  sale cancel  which had appear to be head down  turn back up in march   some of this further weaken may reflect the continu fallout from the pullback in subprim lend  but we also think that hous demand more general has continu to soften   with sale now project to flatten out a lower level than we had previous thought and with the month    suppli of unsold home at a higher level  we anticip that the product adjust will be deeper and longer than was incorpor in our march forecast   moreov  these develop also led us to trim a bit from our hous price forecast   anoth sourc of downward revis in our outlook for real activ was a    per barrel increas in the price of import oil over the intermeet period   as   will discuss short  oil price have back off some sinc the complet of the  book  but they are still run abov our march forecast   the effect of higher crude price has been amplifi by a jump in gasolin margin   those margin have soar as both plan and unplan refineri outag have result in a substanti drop in gasolin inventori   all els be equal  higher consum energi price will like put a notic dent in household incom and consum spend in come month   of cours  not all els has been equal   stock price are about   percent abov the march  book assumpt  and in our forecast  the associ higher level of household net worth provid greater support to consum spend and larg offset the effect of lower real incom   anoth posit offset to weaker hous and higher oil price is the lower project path for the dollar   the dollar drop about   percent over the intermeet period and is expect to remain below our previous project by about that amount   a lower dollar and the accompani higher price for import provid ad impetus to domest product as foreign and domest demand are shift toward domest produc   with near term develop unfold about as we had expect and our longer term project benefit from some power crosscurr  we continu to present you with a reason benign outlook   growth slow but  sn   t falter as actual output move into align with potenti   in contrast to our forecast of real activ  we have made some notabl chang to our project of overal price inflat in the near term   in particular  the recent run up in gasolin price is leav a clear imprint on headlin inflat   a steep jump in consum energi price is project to boost overal pce price inflat  which ran at a    percent pace in the first quarter  to a rate of    percent in the current quarter   an upward revis of     percentag point from our march forecast   meanwhil  core inflat has  on net  come in right in line with our expect   the core measur for februari was     percentag point higher than we had expect and for march was     percentag point lower   for the first quarter as a whole  core pce price increas at a pace of    percent  the same pace that we had project in the last  book   we are anticip a similar size increas in the current quarter   look ahead  i guess our luck with offset error ran out when it came to the inflat forecast   we accumul a number of small chang in the key determin of our inflat project  and for the most part  they point in the same direct   higher energi cost  higher import price  a bit tighter labor and product market  and a slight lower es  of the growth of structur product suggest somewhat greater upward pressur on price inflat   each of these influenc was small  but taken togeth  they caus us to revis up our forecast for core pce inflat by     percent in both      and        despit these revis  we continu to expect core price inflat to edg down next year  from     percent this year to     percent next year  as the effect of higher energi and import price wane  as resourc util eas a bit  and as inflat expect hold rough steadi    will continu our present
the basic messag from the rest of the global economi is that econom condit are favor and appear like to remain so through the end of next year   although small variat in the basic op ist outlook are present  real gdp growth in the foreign economi seem pois to continu at an averag annual rate of about     percent throughout the forecast period   inflat risk are present as slack has been reduc in sever foreign economi   howev  we anticip that central bank abroad will respond further as need such that inflat abroad will edg up onli slight through the end of        in this forecast round  the staff had to contend with a move back up in global crude oil price and further increas in nonfuel commod price   shock common to the whole global economi   in addit  for the u s  outlook  we need to take account of the depreci of approxim   percent in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar over the intermeet period  as dave discuss   we have recent revisit the question of whether we could improv upon the forecast for crude oil price embed in market futur price and have convinc ourselv base on empir evid that we cannot   as a result  our project for futur wti spot oil price and the averag oil import price are shift up and down over  e by fluctuat in spot and futur oil price   this has been an    up    forecast round   after reach a peak around august of last year  global oil price fell through veri earli this year and then revers to trend back up  but not smooth  the upward move of oil price over the intermeet period was appar a respons to the surpris degre of continu product restraint from opec and heighten concern about suppli from iran  iraq  and nigeria   the strength in global demand for energi  too  no doubt provid support for continu elev price   in this forecast we also had to take into account a deviat in the usual price spread between west texa intermedi and other grade of oil   reduc refineri activ has led to an unusu larg accumul of crude oil stock in the midwest  the deliveri area for wti  and depress it price relat to that for other grade   when we were final the baselin forecast  spot and futur price impli an increas to our project for wti crude oil in the current quarter of about       per barrel relat to the project in the march  book  howev  this chang underst a bit the upward shift in overal oil price becaus of the chang in spread   these consider led us to revis upward the averag oil import price in the  book for the current quarter about       per barrel   we expect that over the forecast period the relat price of wti and other grade will gradual move back toward normal  so our upward revis narrow somewhat in futur quarter  particular by the second half of        the baselin forecast reflect the consequ of these higher oil price for the u s  economi and the rest of the world   turn point in the up and down of oil price have an uncanni way of happen at the  e that we are finish the  book  and such a turn point might have happen again   sinc the  book path was set  crude oil price have move back notic   if we were conclud our forecast today base on ye day   s futur price  we would show an upward revis in the near term of onli about half that in the  book   for       our upward shift would be about two third of that in the  book   the effect of this more benign level for oil price would be slight posit for real gdp growth both in the unit state and abroad   such a lower project path for oil price would also slight lessen the pressur on headlin inflat rate that are a featur of the baselin forecast   anoth element in the forecast worth a brief mention is the upward revis to both core import price inflat and core export price inflat for the second quarter  to annual rate of     percent and     percent  respect   price for core import and core export acceler in the first quarter as price for food and industri suppli  particular fuel and metal  surg   metal price have continu to rise in recent week  and the increas  along with the recent depreci of the dollar  led us to revis up our current quarter project   in construct our forecast for these trade price  we base our project of the commod price compon on market futur price   again  we have done recent work to see if a better altern is avail  but we have conclud that none is   despit rapid increas in price of various trade commod over the past few year  the futur market are impli a path through the end of      that is about flat for an index of nonfuel commod  in combin with our project for onli modest real dollar depreci and no major chang in overal inflat rate here and abroad  such an outlook for commod price yield a deceler in both core import price and core export price   our forecast for the increas in these price in      remain low  at     percent   although oil price have been revis up this  e  their project path flatten in mid        this outlook and the flat project path for commod price and the dollar impli a wane of the upward push to consum price that has result from rise oil and commod price   consequ  in the  book forecast  onli limit further tighten by some foreign central bank is requir to contain inflat   that event in these market may surpris futur trader and us for yet anoth year with addit commod price increas is a major risk to our outlook for inflat     and i will be happi to take ani question
thank you   are there question   presid
dave  you talk about the slowdown in structur product in your report   you have mark down your es  for structur multifactor product for the second half of this decad from what you had befor   even befor that you had a declin from the first half of the decad to the second half   so i wonder if you could expand a bit on those comment
certain   as we have report at recent meet  we have been surpris by the extent to which actual product has slow over the past six to eight month  we had been resist a downward revis in our es  of structur product on the expect that we would immin see a signific weaken in labor demand that would  in essenc  suggest that more of the slow was cyclic than appear to be the case   but the tension just seem to be grow greater over  e   as i think bill wascher report in his chart show back in januari  our kalman filter model have been suggest a more substanti downward revis to structur product than we made even in this forecast   some tension there remain  so we thought we need to get a littl better balanc   at the same  e  we have been surpris on the upsid by the strength in labor forc particip   in particular  the particip of worker    year old and older   so it felt as though we need to make some minor adjust here to get a littl better balanc of risk for both our labor forc forecast and our product forecast  now  in august  when we get the annual revis  we   re go to have a better idea of how much of the tension between the incom side and the product side over the past year get resolv in favor of the incom side   in that case  mayb we have overreact by make an adjust  but it just felt at this point as though the shortfal of product relat to our structur product was so much greater than we could explain by normal cyclic behavior that we had to give at least a nod in the direct that mayb this was tell us someth about slight weaker structur product   i realli want to wait until we receiv those figur in august  but it just seem as though enough evid against our forecast had accumul that we need at least  as i said  to nod in that direct
some work has been done on tri to isol whether these chang are in the high tech area or in area across the economi in which peopl are not get as much improv in the use of new high technolog as they did in the past   can you shed ani light on that question
i   ll let bill jump in  if he has ani particular observ on that   i don   t think technolog alon explain the surpris that we   ve had in the past year or so on product   i don   t know of ani work that we or other have done that would allow us to pars out how much of that surpris might have been relat to this high tech issu   the bigger sector question in our mind has been relat to the behavior of construct employ   a decid non high tech area   where we have not seen the falloff that one might have thought would follow from the declin in residenti invest   now it turn out that the work we   ve been do  part at the direct of the chairman  suggest that  although it   s a littl hard to understand  the construct industri appear to exhibit more labor hoard than you would think   the real surpris has been that sinc the turn of the year construct employ hasn   t fallen off more than it has   but one could look back and say that mayb some of the weak in actual product reflect a bigger cyclic effect come from that element   again  if one put a heavi weight on that  one might be less inclin to revis down one   s es  of structur product
okay   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   in comment on presid     s question you mention the disconnect between employ and gdp  particular in the construct area   somehow the lag argument  sn   t ring veri true to me on that one  given that residenti construct has been down for such a long  e and i think a lot of the smaller compani are hard press and probabl some of them are go into bankruptci   so could you elabor on that aspect of the employ puzzl here
i will just rais the white flag    laughter   if you thought about an area in which there would be fewer cost to shed and acquir labor  construct would probabl be right at the top of your list   but the empir evid suggest otherwis   again  this is someth we have just start work on  so i don   t necessarili want to buy into it     percent   but that effect appear to be in the data  and that   s all i can say   i had exact your reaction when i first saw these result   how can that be   some of it   though we don   t think a major part   could be measur   that is  there may have been more adjust on that labor margin that isn   t get pick up in the establish survey   part of it could be that some of those firm that have been  for exampl  do residenti invest are shift to nonresidenti invest  but we run the regress on total construct  and in total construct employ we still find the same puzzl result
is the gdp number on residenti construct put togeth primarili as a distribut lag off start
there are sever major compon   inde  one   the residenti construct compon   is base on a lag off start  both a relat short lag off singl famili start and a longer lag off multifamili start   anoth signific compon is addit and alter  which is base on survey inform   this compon is not veri well measur  it is subject to substanti revis   conceiv  onc more complet count have occur  we may find out that perhap some adjust was go on there  mayb a bigger increas  and therefor more of that employ was in fact occur in add and alt than we current recogn   that is a signific chunk of overal residenti invest
presid    a two hand intervent
i have just a footnot   a larg group of peopl work this industri are self employ   i do not know to what extent you could separ that out  but it  too  is an import piec of this puzzl
yes  that certain could be a factor as well
presid  n
one of the surpris note in the  book  dave  was eci and compens in the first quarter   the increas were not as larg as you had anticip   i know that those number bounc around a lot quarter to quarter  but my impress has been that overal they have been come in somewhat lower than anticip for a while  especi given your es  of the nairu   i do not know whether i have that right  but if i do  what do you think is go on there
let me answer the first quarter surpris and then the longer term surpris that you are point to   we were  inde  veri surpris by the small increas in eci hour compens in the first quarter   but almost all of that surpris occur in one compon   a huge drop in contribut to pension plan   we have check with folk in that particular area  and it look as though that es  declin in construct probabl reflect someth that happen in the real world   that is  the combin of the fact that corpor had previous rais their contribut to high level and the improv in financi market  both the stock market and the real estat market in preced year  suggest that those plan were in better financi shape   there was a declin of    percent at an annual rate in that particular compon   we do not see that declin as necessarili ongo or that reduct in payment as an indic of a lower margin cost of product  so we are not take a big price signal from that compon of labor compens  now that is our excus for the first quarter   look back over a slight longer haul  compens per hour has been run below our model  and that could be suggest a littl more slack in labor market than we are write down   we have not adjust our measur of slack part becaus the surpris on the price side have not been anywher near as larg as those on wage  they have been  if anyth  quit small and not necessarili suggest that this economi has a lot more room   but the compens data taken alon suggest less tight in the overal economi than the product market would
we have an intervent from presid
not an intervent   a question
oh  i   m sorri   let me go then to presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to follow up a bit on the tail end of the convers with presid pool about residenti invest   one of the big chang in your forecast was the addit markdown of push the recoveri in residenti invest out further and sustain a more negat effect on your forecast   my sens is that had a fair signific impact go forward   i am curious as to what extent that outcom was realli model driven in that your actual es  of the fundament chang  or was it more judgment   if it result from the fundament that were predict by the model  what were the piec of evid that were drive that chang  or was it just a judgment thing that is say it will take longer   can you elabor a littl on where that came from
it came princip from the fact that we have been gaug our construct forecast from an expect that builder would tri to adjust product to reduc the month    suppli of unsold home down toward a more normal level over the next coupl of year  between the march forecast and this forecast we were surpris     by the weak in the level of home sale and     by the veri substanti further increas in the month    suppli of unsold home  so to get the inventori of unsold home back into a more normal relationship   and even then we are not get back to where we were in the march forecast in term of month    suppli of unsold home   we saw a bigger product adjust as be necessari   now  the awkward in relat to your question about the fundament is that we actual think that the overhang of unsold home is a fundament  even though it is not realli in our model of residenti construct  those model do not have a special compon for the inventori of unsold home  in part becaus that factor is much more episod than it is a normal sort of right hand side variabl   so we do view it as fundament   we think that what we learn was that a bigger problem is out there  a bigger overhang  and we are have it work off   therefor  it take longer to work that off with deeper product cut
is the overhang measur as the absolut number of unsold home or the ratio of unsold home to current month sale
well  you could do it either way   we did not take  for exampl  the last month   s incred weak in new home sale at face valu   we take a six month move averag  calcul what we think the month    suppli is base on that  and have month    suppli come back to a more normal level over  e   so it is like an inventori sale ratio   the product adjust that we have incorpor in this forecast basic bring that inventori sale ratio most of the way back toward normal by the end of       but not all the way
then what drive the demand for new home   if it is an inventori sale ratio  you were also make some implicit statement about the forecast of demand
absolut   we have a veri mild upturn in home sale as overal activ and incom recov from this soft period  but we do not get the normal kind of pop in hous   what is unusu  in part  about this cycl is that  in past cycl  monetari polici was part respons for drive the declin of demand and then a much easier monetari polici drove a more signific upturn in sale  and that was an import element in bring about balanc   you had part of the adjust come from lower product and part of it be driven by much fa  increas in demand as interest rate fell   in our forecast  mortgag rate are drift up a littl from here  so we do not realli see the condit that will generat a substanti turnaround in sale that might work off this margin of unsold home more through the demand side   but obvious that could still happen
this work as an intervent as well as a question becaus it is exact along the line of presid     s question   first  the assumpt about inventori and where is normal   the past ten year through the hous boom have creat a normal  if you will  of veri low inventori  as compar with the longer run inventori   so the question is  where is normal  and where do builder want normal to be   how much do they have to do to get back to the level where they were for the past ten year versus the level that you could figur over a twenti year or thirti year period   i talk to a group of builder about this a coupl of month ago and did not get a whole lot of feedback from them on where they thought they might like to be  although all of them  i am sure  are make that calcul for themselv in one way or anoth in their busi on a day to day basi   but i think it is hard to say that ani given level of inventori   see how much it chang between the past ten year and the ten or twenti befor that   is    normal    with ani confid   second  i have been take a bit of confid  and mayb this is wrong  from the fact that  if you smooth through sale of exist home  which of cours are a much bigger volum than sale of new home  on a three month or a six month move averag  you do see a dip at the begin of this year and then you see it come back a littl in the environ of reason low interest rate for prime borrow and decent interest in term of mortgag origin and so forth  but obvious not as high as it was   i am think that that mayb say someth about the demand side  but mayb this is just cockey op  on my part
i certain would not say that    laughter   i am glad to hear that the builder you talk to are not give clear answer to that question becaus we have been talk to them as well and have not receiv clear answer   i think this is an open and unresolv question of the forecast   we are predic our forecast or gaug it basic on an expect that  in fact  builder would tri to drive month    suppli back close to where it was on averag over the past ten year  as if that had persist long enough to reflect their desir equilibrium   but that is a big    if     and as you note  if one want to take a twenti year or thirti year averag  that desir month    suppli figur would be higher   so an upsid risk to hous would be that there is not as big an overhang to be work off as we are current gaug in this forecast  on the sale of exist home  i guess we  too  have taken some comfort from the fact that they stabil a bit   more recent there was a dropback in exist home sale and a declin in the index of pend home sale  which has some predict content for exist home go forward  so the pictur is a littl murkier  but i do think those data might suggest that  although it look like a complet free fall in new home sale  you need to factor in the possibl that overal hous demand is not quit as weak as those figur for new home sale
anecdot  we were get some feedback   in new england anyway   that thing are start to heat up   that   s onli in relat term  on the high end side anyway   but who know
are there other question   we had  as you know  a trial run in which particip submit some project   in the interest of illumin the convers that we will have in a moment  i thought i   d ask   just to say a few word about those project
ye day afternoon  we post to the secur document server a summari of the econom project that you submit   the materi should be in front of you with a cover memo from       i will use the tabl direct behind that cover to review briefli the key featur of those project  and then i will outlin the schedul for the trial run go forward   as shown in tabl    the central tendenc of the project suggest that most of you anticip that gdp growth will be somewhat soft this year but will pick up a bit over      and        particip general anticip that core pce inflat will edg a littl lower over the forecast period and that the unemploy rate will inch up to the vicin of    percent   the feder fund rate path associ with this project for the economi  not shown  is fair flat over this year and next and move slight lower in        the width of the    percent confid band for econom variabl suggest a wide rang of outcom for growth  inflat  and the unemploy rate over the forecast period   as note by the memo line  the central tendenc forecast prepar for the may meet  relat to the forecast prepar for the januari fomc meet  indic a somewhat weaker path for econom growth in the near term and a somewhat higher trajectori for the unemploy rate   the central tendenc for core pce inflat has chang littl   in your accompani descript of the key forc shape the econom outlook  most of you cite continu weak in the hous sector   with residenti construct view as like to remain a drag on growth for some  e and the soft in home price note as a factor damp the rise in wealth and consum spend   against this backdrop  gdp growth was expect to remain somewhat below trend for a while  result in a small rise in the unemploy rate  it was also note that labor hoard in some industri over recent month had like    materi use here by mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix     mask an under eas in labor market condit that would becom more appar over the remaind of this year   general accommod financi condit and solid growth abroad were seen as support gdp growth   while most particip look for core pce inflat to edg lower  some relat that the rise in energi price and import price  coupl with recent sluggish product read  would put upward pressur on price over the near term   as a group  you tend to be a bit more op ist about the prospect for aggreg suppli than the staff   sever particip note that their forecast were premis on a higher rate of potenti output growth than project in the  book  owe in part to assess  relat to the staff outlook  that labor forc particip rate would not declin as much or that structur product growth would be stronger   some particip also point out that their forecast incorpor a lower nairu than did the staff outlook   as for the process from here on  if you would like to chang your forecast in light of the discuss at this meet or data receiv sinc you prepar your project  we ask that you submit your revis to the secretariat by the open of busi tomorrow   the staff will draft a minut style narrat descript of the econom project   this will be a standalon document that will circul with the draft minut on the regular schedul   that mean you will see a first draft on may     a second one on may     and a final version on may      we ask that you comment on these draft as if the final version were to be publish   but it won   t be  nor will you be ask to vote on the document
thank you      i have pencil in some  e after the polici decis for discuss and comment about the process and for the head of the subcommitte to talk a littl about what we will be do in our communic discuss go forward   so in the interest of  e  i would ask peopl who have question for   to tri to restrict them primarili to the project themselv and to the econom outlook  if that is okay    anyon have ani question for     if not  we can begin our go round   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   my assess of the econom outlook and the risk to it is larg unchang sinc our last meet   the data sinc that meet have been mix  on the one hand  the veri sluggish real gdp growth in the first quarter give me paus concern potenti downsid risk   much of the first quarter weak  of cours  was due to hous  and i realli don   t see that sector start to turn around at this point   my homebuild and bank contact report stricter underwrit standard for all mortgag  not just subprim one  so residenti invest could remain a signific drag on the economi over the near term as the  book now envis   inde  wherea the  book assum that nation hous price are flat go forward  i am worri that they may actual fall   on the other hand  the improv pictur of auto inventori along with some posit glimmer on manufactur and busi invest suggest that those sector may prove to be less of a drag on the economi go forward   with respect to inflat  the recent news has also been somewhat mix with lower than expect read on core consum price and labor compens offset by higher price for energi  other commod  and import  take a longer view  i anticip real gdp growth over the next two and a half year of about     percent  just a bit below my assess of potenti   my forecast of both actual and potenti growth are a tenth or two stronger than the  book forecast  but the basic stori is veri similar  and the under assumpt  includ the path for the nomin fund rate  are essenti the same   i view the stanc of monetari polici as remain somewhat restrict throughout the entir forecast period   the key factor shape the longer term outlook includ continu fallout from the hous sector  with hous wealth project to be rough flat through        given the reduc impetus from hous wealth  household spend should advanc at a more moder pace go forward than over the past few year  this slowdown in consumpt is reinforc by more moder gain in person incom  as the unemploy rate gradual rise  reach   percent in        although i anticip that the labor market will remain fair tight over the next year  i do not expect fa  compens growth to exert signific upward pressur on price   i expect it instead to restrain profit  given that labor   s share of incom is now at an except low level   i also anticip that various temporari factor that have been boost inflat  such as the run up in owner    equival rent and the pass through of energi price  should dissip  while inflat expect remain well anchor   overal  i   m more op ist regard inflat than the  book and anticip that core pce price inflat will edg down below   percent after next year  one of the more interest question about the outlook  as   note in the question to him  is how to reconcil the strong labor market perform with the weak growth in output or  equival  how much of the recent slowdown in product growth is like to persist   and that is someth that we have been think about  too   over the four quarter of       nonfarm busi product rose     percent  about half as fast as the averag pace set from      through        whether these recent lower number reflect a transitori drop in growth or a downshift in the trend rate is an import issu   a lot of excel research has been done on this topic by staff at the board and elsewher in the system   my read of the evid at this point is that the recent declin in product growth   larg reflect cyclic factor   i think product growth has fallen signific below trend becaus of labor hoard and lag in the adjust of employ to output  we have also been give close scrutini to the behavior of the residenti construct sector and product in that sector   my staff has done some work on es  what product growth has been over the past year or so in residenti invest and in the nonfarm busi sector outsid residenti invest   they es  that essenti all of last year   s slowdown in labor product growth is due to the behavior of product in residenti construct   we es  that residenti construct product drop    to    percent in       wherea product in the nonfarm busi sector outsid residenti invest was well maintain  exact whi those lag exist  again  is a my i to me as well as to   and other  but go forward  it seem to us that  as the adjust lag work themselv out  residenti construct employ will like post signific declin  and product in that sector and the economi as a whole will rebound   that said  the pace of structur product growth may also have declin slight as the  book hypothes   relat to the second half of the     s  both the pace of product growth in the it sector and the pace of invest in equip and softwar have slow  and these factor have probabl depress trend product growth slight in recent year and are like to continu depress it somewhat go forward  but the hypothesi that the recent declin in product growth is main structur   not seem to me to squar well with the broad rang of avail evid   recal that in the     s there was a whole constel of evid   includ a boom stock market  robust consumpt  and rapid busi invest   that was consist with a hypothesi of a last increas in the rate of product growth   in contrast  over the past year or so  busi invest in equip has been veri sluggish and more so than seem warrant by the deceler in busi output   so such weak could reflect lower assess by compani of their abil to improv product through the instal of new capit  and that is  i think  consist with the lower trend of product growth   but you would think that a mark slowdown in secular product growth would also result in downward revis to the expect path of futur profit and real wage  weaken equiti market valuat and crimp consumpt growth   i have seen no sign over the past year that household percept of their futur wealth accumul have been downgrad  in sum  the data seem consist with the view that the recent slowdown in nonfarm busi product repres a temporari cyclic drop that is concentr in residenti construct combin with a modest declin in the trend   so i remain op ist that the under product trend is at or onli slight below     percent
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the seventh district have improv modest sinc my last report   the overal pace of busi activ is still rather restrain  but we have seen some pickup in our manufactur sector   the key issu regard the nation outlook are the same as the one the last  e we met   how will the residenti invest puzzl settl out  and can we explain this puzzl weak in busi fix invest  base on the data that we   ve receiv sinc march and my contact call this round  i   ve becom somewhat more op ist about invest and somewhat more pessimist about hous   at the same  e  higher gasolin price have the potenti to weigh on consum spend   so on balanc our growth project for       and       is a bit lower than it was in march  we now think that growth will averag moder short of potenti over the remaind of       and then run close to potenti in         howev  our gdp number are a bit higher than the  book   s  reflect both a smaller shortfal from potenti this year and a somewhat higher assumpt about the rate of potenti output growth  inde  there has been some good news regard the near term outlook   first  the intern outlook continu to improv   mani of our contact note except strong demand from abroad  particular for capit good   second  although we   ve been activ look for spillov from the problem with subprim mortgag  we have not yet seen major effect on price or the suppli of credit in other market   that is not to say that we have not heard of ani effect   one of our director  the cfo of a major nation homebuild  note that tighter underwrit standard are reduc hous demand somewhat outsid the subprim sector  consum still appear to have ampl access to financ   for exampl  the head of gm note that bank were make more auto loan with six  or seven year matur in order to lower month payment for liquid strap consum  final  as i note earlier  we feel a bit more confid in our assumpt that the weak in bfi will turn out to be relat transitori   i don   t want to make too much out of one month   s noisi data  but the latest read on capit good order and the pmi  purchas manag    index  were encourag  and most of the comment from my busi contact have been posit in this regard   the impress i have from these discuss is that the paus in invest spend is show earli sign of end  but this is veri earli  and we clear need to keep monitor develop care  beyond the near term cyclic develop  the chang in structur product in the  book highlight an import sourc of risk to the longer run outlook for sustain non inflationari growth  as   just discuss   there is a lot of uncertainti about the compon of structur product   in our view  we haven   t seen enough evid yet to mark down structur product as much as the  book has   consequ  our es  of potenti output growth is a bit higher than that of the  book  with regard to inflat  the incom inform has caus the forecast from our indic model to come down a bit   they now project that core pce price will rise    percent this year and     percent in         but we do not see ani progress beyond that   if we carri our model out to        they have inflat stay at     percent  higher than my prefer rang  furthermor  i see some upsid risk to this forecast   neither our gdp project nor the  book   s generat ani meaning resourc slack over the project period  and then there are the higher cost for energi and other commod and increas in import price   so we will be reli heavili on stabl expect to keep inflat in check   i believ we are current achiev some implicit tighten of polici by keep rate on hold dure this period of sluggish activ  but this restraint will wane if the real economi return to potenti by earli next year as we expect   so i continu to think that the risk to price stabil domin the risk to sustain growth
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  last  e i report a sens that the intern economi was hot  that our domest economi was cold  and that the region economi of the eleventh district was just about right   i conclud my comment by say that we were in treacher water in term of the u s  economi  navig between the scylla of inflat and the charybdi of a slowdown in growth   like presid    i don   t have much chang to report  but i do want to comment in veri brief order on a coupl of aspect that my two predecessor comment on  as far as the intern economi is concern  we see continu expect for higher growth and a differ mindset begin to set in   you saw that  i believ  in the french elect  even italian consum and busi confid is at a ten year high  or six year high depend on which measur you use   you also see it reflect in various measur of port congest  charter rate for ship  and profit contribut to u s  multin   by the way  the contact that we talk to  bill  are make a real effort to ferret it out and have a sens that there should be more push or oomph from abroad than they are get domest   you still have to prune those report care   you see it in commod price   the bottom line from the standpoint of the dalla fed is that we   re see a tighten of capac util in the rest of the world  which is somewhat vex for u s  oper becaus it limit our firm    abil to cut cost by ship product abroad   nonetheless  the rest of the world economi remain hot  i have just a coupl of comment about the unit state   when i talk to the rail  the airlin  the express deliveri logist compani  the middl incom consumpt sector such as retail  or those that sell into those sector  i am hear increas report of weaker demand and lower expect than i was hear at the last meet in all but one sector  which is the entertain sector   advertis revenu for the network continu to stay high  and by the way  visit to theme park are at a record high  driven larg by wealthi foreign who are find them to be a tremend bargain   on the hous front  i have been bearish   more bearish than anybodi at this tabl   i remain so  and like presid   and  i believ  presid    i am more concern than i was befor   we can go through the number  but i think it is best express by the ceo of one of the five big builder  who said that in march he was argu intern with his board that the headlin were wors than realiti and now realiti is wors than the headlin   there is signific inventori  and the qualif of buyer is becom a veri vex issu   i suspect that this situat has yet to run it cours   i am also hear continu report  despit layoff and a slow economi  of continu tight of high skill labor and continu price pressur on that front   final in term of the domest economi  we are benefit from a weaker dollar in term of tourism flow and also the high end retail  most of which are in presid     s district and one   neiman marcus   in my own district   other than that  i have noth to add on the u s  economi  i want to talk about inflat for a minut   the data   whether core pce or overal  core cpi  or even the trim mean  which we focus on in dalla   seem to be indic a temper of pressur   so we have some meat on the bone of our expect  or i should say our hope  that some deceler of inflat pressur would manifest itself   but in talk to my busi contact  i would say   if you will forgiv a terribl revers of biblic scriptur   that  though the flesh may be will  the spirit is weak   what i mean is that even though they would like to believ the number  in term of their own behavior pattern and the way they are posit their manag  they feel enorm threat to their margin come from slow volum growth and come from increas cost pressur in that they alloc task global   and their first reaction is to see how they could chang the price structur domest   chemic are report that a   to   percent price action that was taken at the begin of the year is stick   my contact from a larg produc of food product said that they are shift their overal model away from focus on unit volum expans to price  and even a ubiquit brand like starbuck is move away from the number of transact to figur out how to price more aggress or to restructur the size of their contain  as are mani food product produc   the larg consum paper product report that they were budget zero percent price inflat at the begin of the year and have redon their budget to price at   to   percent   if i had to pick a word  mr  chairman  in term of the mood of our compani regard the u s  economi  i would say that it   s somewhat dyspept   it   s not a veri pleasant mood   they feel a littl indigest becaus of the margin pressur that they   re get and limit relief in term of what they   re abl to pull out in volum expans  i am in an unusu posit of come from what i believ  read the beig book and look at the data  is a district that continu to signific outperform the rest of the economi  although we have slow somewhat  yet when you look at the histogram  i have the lowest forecast for gdp for this year   so i am the most pessimist at the tabl in term of short term econom growth  and on the inflat front i would just resort to a ronald reagan  which is that we need to trust but verifi   in short  i would not be surpris to see disappoint growth in the second quarter  much more disappoint than in the  book   s forecast  nor would i be surpris to see higher core pce inflat sustain itself than i am hear from some of my colleagu and from the staff   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   the anecdot report that i have accumul sinc we last met are almost   i guess i should elimin    almost      are unambigu on the soft side   i emphas    soft     which i think is a better word than    weak     except perhap with my truck industri contact  who say that volum in both march and april is down   percent over a year ago and   not know exact what is happen   truck compani bankruptci are up sharpli      percent abov a year ago   truck ship rate are weak   for the first quarter they were up just slight year over year  and in the second quarter they were down a coupl of percentag point   my contact say that the volum declin are general across the countri and widespread across industri segment   the compani has reduc capac and will continu to do so  and other in the industri are do the same thing   so there is a big inventori of use truck sit out there in the market  and some of these truck are be sold abroad  in the packag deliveri busi are fedex and up   i mention the name of those compani becaus it is obvious who is in the packag deliveri busi  you cannot realli disguis that    laughter   fedex say that the busi is come in a littl below plan and that it volum in less than truckload busi is flat   other are down   domest express volum is down   percent year over year   the ground packag network is grow substanti   a lot of that is divers from the express busi becaus ground deliveri is cheaper   fedex may be delay some of it expans project  put them off three to twelv month   not fundament chang it long run expans plan but delay some capit expenditur  which are expect to be down    percent from the earlier plan for this year but still up    percent over the previous fiscal year   my contact express confid that the slowdown is temporari  he expect a pickup in the august septemb  efram   fedex has no difficulti in hire the peopl the compani need except in account and audit field   i heard essenti the same stori from up   ground volum there is up about   percent year over year   up is have to discount rate after put through price increas last year   cap ex is up somewhat in       compar with         profit margin are under huge pressur  the price environ is veri competit  i develop a new contact in the qsr industri   now  you may not know what the qsr industri is  but it stand for    quick serv restaur      other peopl call it fast food    laughter   in the restaur busi  the casual dine industri is a more discretionari kind of outlay  and that traffic is down   percent year over year   traffic in the qsr industri is down   to   percent   this is across the industri  all the differ compani in that busi   they have been put through price increas of rough   percent   so in term of dollar volum  their comp are down   in the   percent to   percent area  my contact from a larg u s  bank note that the economi is in a soft patch that may be extend for a while and that busi cash flow and balanc sheet are solid   there is someth of a my i as to whi cap ex is not stronger   from proprietari  intern data on credit card usag  i learn that the growth of credit card usag is slow  it had been about   percent year over year and is down to   percent   on an earli read of the april data     distinct weak    was the comment   particular  non auto sale may have declin   i guess we get the retail sale number on friday   it is like that april retail sale are weak   talk about credit demand  a lot of the demand for c i loan  accord to my contact  is realli not the standard c i type of thing but instead is be driven primarili by merger and acquisit activ  hedg fund  privat equiti  and state and local govern borrow   credit qualiti remain veri high  on the outlook  my take is that the economi has slow  and the real issu is whether we have a temporari soft patch from which the economi will recov on it own or whether this is the begin of a cumul weak   it is often the case  particular if you think about some of the model of busi cycl  that weak after a  e can feed on itself and becom cumul   i do not think that we know enough to be abl to make realli a solid es  on that   i would note that we like do not have an inventori complic  which has been so import in past busi cycl develop   inventori seem to be pretti well control on the whole   also  output is certain be support by the stock market and by a weaker dollar   i would also note the unab growth in the monetari aggreg  both mzm and m    we see no sign of tradit downturn behavior from those measur   i will stop there   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in new england seem broad support of the continu expans of the region at about the pace of the nation as a whole  perhap becaus the pace of nation activ has slow somewhat and so the region seem to be lag less  though i do think there is a bit of a brighter tone to econom activ   i certain do not want to overemphas that  howev  as concern do linger about the strength of job growth and the hous market  among other thing  two matter came up in our round of gather data and anecdot around the region  first  although growth in overal labor cost in the region is moder relat to that of the nation  concern continu about the cost and avail of skill labor   respond are also increas concern about other input cost   oil  copper  zinc  other metal  and chemic   and report that they are attempt to pass on higher cost within the suppli chain or direct to consum and are succeed in mani case   we have not heard much local yet about the effect of three dollar a gallon for gasolin  and i am hope the refineri outag that appar caus this uptick prove temporari enough not to dent region demand or to increas price pressur   howev  the general rise in primari energi cost is not particular reassur   second  while the residenti real estat data for the region continu to be downbeat in term of permit  start  year over year sale  and price trend  anecdot   particular as they regard high end market  as i note befor   offer some hope that the spring pictur for sale of exist home will be brighter when all the data are in   i had a comment in here about spring weather  but that turn ye day  so i won   t make that comment    laughter  the incom data sinc the last committe meet contain some pluse and minus that  by and larg  offset one anoth   thus our forecast in boston  which is quit close to the  book and similar to other forecast around the tabl  has not chang an aw lot   in short  the economi appear to have made what one hope is the final step down in overal growth from it unsustain momentum of onli a year or so ago and is in the process of settl in at a pace that will gradual acceler over this year to slight below potenti in       and         this forecast assum that the effect of the hous bust begin to subsid by midyear and that busi and consum confid remain strong enough to support continu hire  consumpt  and busi invest   it also assum that strength in the rest of the world buoy corpor profit and foreign consumpt of our export and  combin with a slowli declin dollar  add at least margin to u s  growth   all of this occur with a continu of veri accommod financi market that both sustain household wealth and eas borrow cost and provid a haven for foreign invest flow   final  the current boost in energi cost prove temporari  and inflat subsid gradual as unemploy move up slight  reflect the output gap creat by a year or more of slight sub potenti perform   look at the data we receiv on other project through        our forecast fell within the central tendenc in all the area  but i think that we see inflat as somewhat more persist than other do   along the line of the  book   in fact  this forecast sound pretti good to me as an outcom if it work out this way  and i have even begun to think  versus where i was at the last meet  that the risk around both side of this forecast may be a littl smaller  on the growth side  the big question involv spillov from the hous bust and possibl the problem with subprim adjust rate mortgag  but we have been expect to see spillov for some  e  and they are yet to emerg in ani real way   they still might  and we  like the  book author  have mark down our forecast for residenti invest in       base on incom data   but i am inclin to think that broader market and econom spillov get less like over  e   in fact  as i note befor  mayb there is some level off in sale of exist home if we smooth through the month to month variat in the data   credit restraint could well damp the particip of subprim borrow in home purchas  but low mortgag rate ought to support prime borrow  and we see evid for this in discuss with local bank and certain all the advertis in newspap and on televis that are focus on the theme that now is the  e to borrow becaus mortgag rate are low and mayb they will not stay that way for long   so we think   i think anyway   that we have some reason to believ that  through this year  home buy may help keep home price and equiti posit or perhap neutral contributor to household wealth   inde  assum that gasolin price edg off their current high level and that equiti market continu on an upward pace  there is at least some possibl on the upsid for consum spend  anoth aspect to the growth forecast that concern me at our last meet was the unusu slow pace of busi invest in equip and softwar   given the under fundament of robust corpor profit  cash reserv  and a declin user cost  especi for high tech good  we would have expect fa  growth   i am still concern here  especi as such spend pattern could augur poor for continu hire  but i find the most recent data on order and shipment and the ism survey encourag  although as presid   mention  one should not take a lot of confid from a singl month   s data   so all in all  it seem  to me anyway  that the downsid risk around growth in our forecast are a bit less  on the inflat front  i remain concern that the forecast is just a bit too perfect   without too extend a growth slump  unemploy rise slight  and inflat fall slowli   we have not done the work that san francisco has on slice and dice product  and i found     s comment veri interest   i also am veri much in agreement with her and other    perspect that the level of under structur product growth may not be declin to the degre that the  book author seem to think it might   howev  if what seem to be a cyclic low continu  unemploy could well be sticki   both the recent increas in energi and raw materi cost and the burgeon growth in the rest of the world could increas resourc pressur at the same  e that the dollar continu it slow declin   all of this taken togeth could be a recip for acceler rather than deceler inflat   as i   ve note befor  i realli have no problem with stabl inflat around it current low level   what   concern me  howev  is the potenti for acceler   in that regard  the recent small moder in core data was welcom  though certain not suffici to eas this concern entir  in sum  i remain readi to bet on the baselin forecast   i think it is about as good as we can hope for   there continu to be risk on both side  but at this point i would not weigh them equal  be wrong on the inflat side could be a more difficult place to be   that is  if growth falter  it is clear what to do  but if inflat should acceler  it might take a while and be quit cost to remedi   thus  i would continu to favor polici that incorpor a bit of insur   but we will get to that later   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   fifth district econom activ continu to be mix   our manufactur indic continu to drift lower in the past few week  appar diverg from the nation trend   this may be becaus furnitur and textil are particular weak  and these industri are a signific greater share of our activ than of activ elsewher   respond    expect regard futur manufactur activ remain upbeat but had drift a bit lower   after two bad month  read on the district   s retail sector have return to neutral  help by a sharp turnaround in big ticket sale   retail employ and wage index rose signific as well  and expect for futur demand increas sharpli  for servic firm outsid the retail sector  our index has moder a bit over the past three month  though it remain posit  and measur of expect demand have held up quit well  hous market in our district are typic busiest this  e of year  as elsewher  and contact are report softer overal sale this year  as you might expect   have said that  i continu  howev  to hear report that home price below          or abov          are sell well  we hear report of a lack of inventori close to d c   although presid   has a properti for sale you might be interest in    laughter

commerci real estat activ general remain solid  although some observ express concern about the sustain of the quit strong pace of offic construct in northern virginia   our survey measur of manufactur price trend seem to have moder sinc the begin of the year  consist with sluggish demand in that sector  on the servic side  price trend seem to have declin somewhat sinc the first half of last year  although measur of servic price have been choppi and trendless over the past few month as a whole  turn to the nation economi  hous news has been disappoint  but news about busi invest and manufactur has been encourag   howev  the overal outlook hasn   t chang terribl much sinc our last meet   hous begin to stabil in the second half of this year  busi invest in equip and softwar pick up  and consum spend remain relat healthi   as a result  i expect real growth to return to trend in        although my outlook broad agre with that of the  book  there are some minor differ   but i should emphas that they are minor   first  i remain a tad more op ist about trend growth   i   m expect someth closer to    than to       second  i still think that residenti invest will bottom out in the middl of the year rather than continu to slide into         of cours  it is quit difficult to have a lot of confid in ani one scenario for the hous market  in part becaus the recent data have been fair choppi   the figur for home sale  which late last year suggest that hous demand had stabil  now suggest that demand may be take anoth step downward   if so  this would increas the size of the cumul reduct in start relat to new home sale that will be need to work off the inventori overhang   it   s veri hard to know  howev  just how far hous activ need to fall befor it come back into stabl align with incom and prefer   but my hunch is that the drag on growth will not last quit as long as the  book say  and i still see reason good prospect for stabil in the hous sector in the second half of this year   i also think that the hous correct will have onli limit effect on spend outsid residenti invest   in particular  i   m a bit more op ist than the  book about household spend  as for inflat  the  book now has us wait until the third quarter of       befor we see a moder in core inflat   even then  we get onli     percent   i would view this outcom as fair disappoint   but if i had been ask for an uncondit forecast  i probabl would have submit someth a lot like that   instead  we were ask for a project condit on what  in our judgment  would be an appropri monetari polici   so the project i submit has core pce inflat at     percent next year and     percent in       under what  in my judgment  would be an appropri monetari polici  we use the chairman   s juli tes oni to announc that the fomc   s object is for pce inflat to averag     percent and that the committe intend to reduc inflat to that level within two year  while such an announc would not necessarili shift inflat expect immedi downward  i project that consist communic from committe member accompani by further rate increas when downsid growth risk abat later this year would bring expect into line with our object by earli next year   although growth would be weaker this year than in my uncondit forecast  it would ul  return to trend in       and the proper measur sacrific ratio would turn out to be signific smaller than is often assum or infer from standard phillip curv es    i mention this scenario simpli to reiter that i believ that there   s a feasibl altern to the hypothesi that inflat will settl in around   percent or higher unless we engin a substanti output gap

thank you  mr  chairman   the economi from the perspect of the fourth district isn   t materi differ from the way i heard dave describ nation condit  manufactur in the district general report modest but steadi growth   in particular  metal produc and their supplier report strong order and product   my busi contact are tell me that capit invest is a bit soft  but it should not at this point pose a serious problem for the overal economi  i   ve had sever meet with homebuild throughout my district in the past few week  and they confirm some of the inform that we see in the nation data   sale are still veri anem  and the inventori of unsold home remain quit high   they also share some inform that is not easi to pull from the nation indic   for exampl  sale of starter and lower end home are particular slow  in part becaus lend standard have been signific tighten   this mean that there has been a shift in the composit of home sold toward the upper end of the price spectrum  caus the report sale price data to be a littl inflat   the builder i spoke with assur me that price discount are occur and that the discount have been substanti   likewis  i am told that apprais are increas be ask by lender to do whatev possibl to apprais the properti relat to current market condit and to discount price inform from the histor compar   my contact are also say that the expect that home price are go to fall further has been keep some buyer on the sidelin for now   i also hear that  when possibl  residenti contractor are shift resourc to nonresidenti project   some nation public trade home construct compani are complet hous and sell them for a loss in some market just so that they can exit those market more quick   what i take away from my convers with homebuild and lender is that the nation data may not yet fulli have caught up with the poor condit in the residenti construct sector and  further  those closest to the market are bet that ani semblanc of a recoveri is still a long way off  this inform had an influenc on the econom project that i submit for today   s meet   like the  book  which as a consequ of more weak in residenti construct has shave an addit     percentag point off gdp growth in the latter half of this year  i have mark down my expect for growth in        my project see a littl more growth relat to what i see in the  book as we move into      and       although i do see slower econom growth as an obvious risk to my outlook   i   m especi concern about the possibl of some spillov from the hous sector to the busi invest outlook  my inflat project call for a slight more op ist trend in core pce than what i see in the  book   i had difficulti endors a three year project that  sn   t assum that our polici are go to be posit so that we eventu bring core pce inflat back below   percent  if onli just below   so my inflat project repres my interpret of appropri monetari polici   name one that will bring core pce in under   percent   my econom project is  therefor  base on a feder fund rate path that is veri similar to the  book baselin  a constant path over the project period  but i have assum a slight more op ist price path for oil   given     s comment this morn  i am a littl more comfort with that assumpt   i also have slight more potenti than the  book    so with these two assumpt  i do have a slight lower path for inflat than the  book     obvious  these assumpt are not made with great convict  and inflat may continu to track just north of   percent   if it    we do risk condit expect to this level  and that is an outcom that i would not welcom  i had an opportun just a few week ago to spend a day with paul volcker  who visit cleveland   on the subject of inflat  he remind me that in his experi big inflat start out as a toler of modest inflat   onc inflat expect drag their anchor a littl  it   s difficult and cost to get them re anchor  and this  i think  remain the biggest risk that we face as a committe   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the near term outlook for the third district is moder growth go forward   the major sourc of the strength in the district continu to be employ growth  and nonresidenti construct is fair stabl and modest healthi  howev  manufactur continu to be sluggish and residenti construct weak  job growth has pick up consider in our district  have grown at     percent at an annual rate in the past few month   unemploy rate have fallen in the region  and the labor market in pennsylvania in particular has been especi strong   to get a better handl on labor market condit  in our last busi outlook survey we ask a panel of firm whether they had experienc problem fill job in the past three month becaus applic didn   t have suffici qualif   remark  more than two third of our firm said that they had troubl with this and that the percentag has been grow sinc we first start ask the question three year ago  the strength in the region labor market is reflect in the rebound in our staff   s index of lead indic of econom activ in the three state in our district  especi in pennsylvania  where the index is predict stronger growth over the remain three quarter of the year   an area of stabil in our region   s economi has been the ongo modest strength in nonresidenti construct   the growth in this sector has recent been larg in noncommerci construct   hospit  educ build  and so forth   howev  general commerci vacanc rate in philadelphia have been fall steadili  and the absorpt rate in center citi is near at a record high   with regard to manufactur  growth is stall  accord to our april manufactur survey  our general activ index is close to zero  or just mild posit  as it has been sinc late last year   both new order and shipment are close to zero  as they were   further  in april the index of futur capit expenditur was down somewhat and below the averag that we have been see in most expans   the onli bright spot was the signific bump up in our futur activ index  which signal that more robust activ is anticip by our survey particip   it also come as no surpris that residenti construct remain weak in the district  and hous permit have continu to declin as the valu of residenti construct contract has as well   also  there seem to be littl or no appreci in hous price   on the inflat front in the district  price paid and price receiv by manufactur have moder a bit   further  retail are report veri littl chang in price over the past few month   in summari  the third district is grow slowli  and our staff project is for modest growth go forward   labor market fundament appear strong  but we have yet to see ani sign of the pickup in manufactur that some of the nation number indic  on the nation level  sinc the last meet i have actual becom a bit more comfort with the econom situat   while i say that i am more comfort  that   s a relat not an absolut statement   the most recent month   s read on core inflat were welcom  but i think that caution and vigil are still the order of the day   inde  the  book author  as we   ve note  seem to have been revis their forecast of core inflat upward slight over the past sever month rather than downward  and that to me is a bit disturb  even if the number don   t chang a whole lot  news that has made me more comfort with the project of a somewhat quicker return to someth closer to trend growth in the second half of the year is the recent strength in durabl good order and the ism number  which are indic that manufactur has pick up   further  recent strength in manufactur was broad base  and the output of busi equip was strong   along this dimens  i am in agreement with the latest forecast of the board staff   howev  these report repres onli one month of data  as peopl have said  and although they are consist with a modest bounceback in the second quarter  there is still substanti uncertainti   i hope that  in the come month  those data will be reinforc as new data come in  but  again  at this point that is onli wish think   i would add  though  that my busi contact  particular in the financi sector  continu to report to me that busi loan are strong  c i loan are strong  demand is strong for loan  and balanc sheet and firm still look good   so they see thing as look good from their perspect  but that posit news is not realli show up in some of these other number  at least as yet   so i   m a bit puzzl by that   furthermor  job growth and person incom growth appear to be on solid foot  and i find myself increas puzzl by the weak in the labor market as portray by the  book forecast   the strength in person incom  along with a rebound in asset market  lead me to view consumpt as somewhat healthier go forward than the  book see it  those circumst  coupl with the more posit news on invest to which i just allud  lead me to view closer to trend growth as the best forecast and  therefor  to have a littl more op  in my outlook for the second half of the year and into         that is reflect in the forecast that i submit  that said  i realiz there are signific risk to this return to trend growth   the biggest risk remain hous   the extrem fluctuat in weather over the past four to five month have made discern trend a lot more difficult  and i   m not sure exact how much season adjust factor are bounc the number around and make it harder to disentangl effect  inventori of hous  as we have talk about  remain extrem high  and there is veri littl signal of a pickup in demand  at least as yet   howev  i   m a littl skeptic that this sector will continu to subtract a full percentag point of real growth from the forecast  as the  book suggest   i   m a littl more op ist than that   i remain op ist in part becaus i think real mortgag rate remain relat low   i see strong incom growth continu  and i am increas less concern  actual  about the spillov from subprim market   so i can envis hous demand strengthen a bit more than is impli in the  book  and that lead to less of a subtract go forward  on the inflat front  i   m a bit less worri than last  e but far from sanguin   the last core pce inflat number was obvious veri encourag at someth close to zero  but  again  we have to be veri care in extrapol out one month   s data   as i said befor  the  book author seem to be inch up their forecast of core inflat or at least push the declin out further into the futur  and that concern me a bit   i believ inflat is still too high  inflat expect are stabl  but they are too high as well  and we need to bring that rate down   thus  we need to be vigil here and continu with a somewhat restrict polici  in regard to my forecast  i   m not go to say much   i just assur you that  without collus  presid     s view of the forecast and how it evolv is veri similar to mine   so rather than repeat what he said  i will just let his comment larg speak for mine   i have a slight fa  return to trend growth  part becaus my product es  are somewhat higher   i thought       s comment about her product analysi were quit thought  and i appreci them   the op  monetari polici  or at least my prefer path for monetari polici  might includ some tighten if trend growth return more quick than we had indic   but  inde  my forecast for core pce was actual down to     percent by        i   ll stop there   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i gave a fair detail summari of the district   s economi last  e  and it hasn   t chang a great deal sinc then   so i   ll be fair brief  the labor market in the region remain fair tight  they have not loosen at all sinc our last meet   our manufactur sector continu to show strength   our agricultur sector continu to show strength   hous is the one area that  as in other part of the countri  has shown weak as inventori have built  but we haven   t seen dramat declin in price at this point  and we will watch that  as other are watch it within their region  on the nation outlook  we see that the economi will continu to grow at someth below trend   we   re a littl more op ist than the  book  but the point is that we should see the economi grow below trend   for all the reason that other have said  we expect inflat to moder  but reason slowli  over the next eighteen month   therefor  anticip the next discuss  i would say that  as a polici group  we need to be resolut in our own polici in term of hold our posit fair firm   so i   ll leav it at that until we get to the polici discuss  mr  chairman   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   my outlook for the economi  which is essenti for sustain growth near trend and for a modest diminut of core inflat over  e  hasn   t chang appreci   to be sure  i have mark down my forecast for this year  larg in recognit of realiti   that is  the weak first quarter  and i anticip some further sluggish in the second quarter as well   but after that  i expect growth to acceler to near trend   underpin that anticip perform is product improv of someth like    percent a year or mayb a littl less  and employ gain in the neighborhood of     to     percentag point per year   on the demand side  i expect sustain increas in consum spend  in busi invest  includ structur  and in net export   i don   t think the outlook for the hous sector has realli chang appreci recent  at least relat to what i had been expect   given that inventori level were and are still high  i think that it will be some  e befor we see ani meaning improv in residenti construct   my confid in this general view of the outlook is heighten by my interpret of histori   the economi grew   percent or better over the four year from      through        more import and more broad  if you think about the perform of the economi over the past two and a half decad  it hasn   t been wise to make major bet against sustain  healthi growth   so that   s what i   m realli expect  as for inflat  becaus i view the current stanc of monetari polici as moder restrict   and the basi for that is some version of the taylor rule  es  of the real feder fund rate relat to it equilibrium  and some rule of thumb that we have   i do expect that core inflat will gradual slow from here  assum that we maintain the approxim stanc of polici that we have adopt   i think that anoth reason is that some of the uptick in core inflat was transitori   i would add that  if you look at the latest three   six   and twelv month increas in core cpi or core pce  you do in fact see some wane of inflat  of cours  the wane is due in part to the favor number we got in march  but it  sn   t appear to be exclus due to the march number   in ani event  if inflat is go to slow  it has to be in the latest number    laughter   i mean  there is no other way for that to occur   with that  i will conclud
thank you for the arithmet    laughter

thank you  mr  chairman   sinc the last meet  aggreg econom activ in the sixth district has expand moder   employ momentum in most area of the district continu to exceed that of the nation overal   florida is our except  most area of florida now lag the nation   similar  the hous downturn  as measur by sale and permit  remain less sever in the district than for the nation  except for much of florida  the hous downturn in florida has shown littl sign of bottom out  as builder continu to expect even lower level of construct   permit issuanc continu in steep declin  down over    percent from march a year ago   we are not inclin to suggest that there is signific for the nation as a whole in the florida develop   we have heard anecdot view from florida that there was a run up in specul activ in the second home market in      and       buyer were bid up price in anticip of flip properti at higher price   so florida is idiosyncrat   it is idiosyncrat also in the state   s ongo insur cost problem relat to hurrican risk   howev  in the atlanta region  the convers we   ve had with homebuild about the hous market rais concern of a steepen declin in sale of new home   atlanta has general track the nation  so we are care watch hous sector develop in georgia  particular in atlanta  despit these negat in the hous sector  we continu to find onli limit evid of spillov from the residenti real estat adjust to other sector of the region economi  labor market appear to have remain veri tight in the district   the measur unemploy rate is around   percent for the district versus     percent nation   even the demand for skill build tradesmen appear strong  as builder   and this may be relev to the earlier discuss   seem to be take the opportun to upgrad the qualiti of their staff   trend in state sale tax revenu support the view that consum spend has been relat unaffect by the hous downturn   again  the except is florida  where sale tax revenu in the first quarter were substanti below year ago level  our perspect on the nation economi is that signific uncertainti remain about the overal outlook for      and for the path of inflat   our econom staff use three model to forecast the key macroeconom measur   our averag forecast for real gdp growth is general in line with the  book forecast  and neither suggest that a recess is a risk  there are minor differ between our composit forecast and the  book on unemploy   the onli signific differ is the declin path of inflat in the  book versus our inflat forecast that hold steadi around     percent for the forecast period   so  to summar  we harbor greater doubt than the board staff that the inflat rate will come down as project in
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   our outlook has chang veri littl   as in march  we see the expans continu  with growth move back up to potenti   we see potenti around   percent   later this year   this view rest on the familiar expect   hous stabil relat soon without a major drop in price  invest spend strengthen somewhat as the temporari factor hold it down reced and posit fundament reassert themselv  consumpt moder a bit but continu to be support by strong incom growth  the save rate move up but onli modest and slowli  and extern demand remain strong   we still expect inflat to moder gradual to a rate just below   percent for the core pce by the end of         we view the recent number as somewhat reassur   recent data in general have provid a bit more comfort for this scenario   on balanc  the downsid risk to growth have diminish a bit   the risk that inflat will fail to moder suffici  howev  remain signific and materi   but in general  the overal outlook  in our view  hasn   t chang that much  now  our forecast assum that we hold the fed fund rate where it is for a while   our expect path is abov the market   s but below the  book   s   we   re below the  book becaus  although our expect forecast is realli similar  we attach somewhat greater weight to altern scenario that suggest slower growth   the recent growth number have been  on balanc  encourag  and the market are a bit more confid about the outlook than they were  but i still think the downsid risk to growth are signific   hous could still surpris on the downsid  and we could see a deeper  more protract contract in activ and  of cours  broad base more substanti declin in price   consumpt could be weaker for this reason or becaus the save rate rise for other reason  such as pessim about long run incom growth   the household sector is substanti more leverag than it was  and it has less of a cushion to absorb shock and  therefor  present some risk of amplifi rather than mitig broader weak in the economi   although a bit better than it was in march  the invest outlook is still a bit tenuous  and it seem unlik to be a substanti sourc of strength if broader weak in demand in the rest of the economi materi   the most rapid grow part of the world are grow well abov potenti and face rise inflat and substanti asset price inflat  and i think the author there are general start tentat to tighten polici more signific  on the inflat front  we still face substanti uncertainti about what is happen to under trend and how they will evolv   the broader inflat environ is  if anyth  less benign than it has been over the past three quarter  with inflat acceler a littl outsid the unit state  energi and commod price continu to show sign of rapid demand growth  the dollar potenti weaken further  compens here firm a bit  and product growth probabl stay a bit below what we thought was trend   in this context  with inflat still run about   percent  inflat expect could drift up  continu on the risk for a bit  i still think we live with a signific risk of a sharp deterior in financi market   credit spread  other risk premium  low level of impli volatil  and the strength of asset price in mani part of the world   all impli a level of confid in ongo  stabl growth and low inflat that seem a bit implaus   in addit  the low level of long forward rate seem hard to reconcil with the strength of demand growth outsid the unit state  suggest that much of the world is like to need to move further toward tighter monetari polici   as financi condit exert more restraint on demand growth global  we could see a rapid unwind of this long period of veri benign assess of fundament risk   we  of cours  face some risk of polici action here in the form of trade or invest protect   this risk  against the backdrop of some uncertainti about the strength of product growth go forward  might make the rest of the world less comfort financ our still larg extern balanc on the favor term that have prevail thus far  on the longer term outlook for potenti in the unit state  we are stick with our forecast of   percent  but we have alter the mix a bit  just as the  book has in some sens  howev  we feel a littl less comfort with our basic view about potenti   we lower our product growth assumpt a bit  to      for the nonfarm busi sector  and rais our es  of trend hour a bit   if potenti is lower than we   re assum  then we are less like to see the moder of inflat that we current expect  but we would expect a lower path for output growth as well   at this stage  howev  in view of the strength in incom growth that we   ve seen  earn expect  and other measur  we   re reluct to embrac a more negat view about growth in potenti  on balanc  in view of these risk  i favor stay where we are for a while   i don   t think there is a veri strong case for tighten polici or for induc a signific rise in market expect about the path of the fed fund rate go forward  nor do i think now that we   re at risk of be too tight   so  in general  i think the best choic for us is to continu to lean against the expect that we will move to reduc rate soon   thank you
thank you   it is         whi don   t we take a twenti minut coffe break and adjourn until about         thank you   coffe break
okay   let   s reconven   presid   has a two hander
a quick comment was just brought to mind becaus of     s comment   i regular meet with a group of invest peopl befor fomc meet  compar with the past sever month   particular dure the  e of the last meet  when we were just come off some financi market upset  especi in the equiti market   they were say that they felt that financi market were frothier right now than they had been over the past three or four year  there was more money out there chase more deal and a level of froth that to them seem unsustain   i don   t know what implic that has for current policyset   i   m not wise enough to know that   but i do see it  as   indic that he did  as a risk that lie over the whole environ   even though we have slower growth and somewhat higher inflat  this overal forecast is so benign  and despit what the yield curv and the fed fund futur tell us  the market seem to be buy into the whole benign outlook and think that it   s go to continu forev   clear it won   t   what the spillov effect will be and what we can do about them now or in succeed meet are question to which i don   t have an answer  but i do think they are question  and i would like to reiter what   had to say
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   my outlook  like most of the rest of your  was basic the same as the one in the  book  and it hasn   t chang all that much over the past few week   like the rest of you  i see incom grow at less than the growth rate of potenti for sever quarter  the pace held down by hous and the slower growth of consumpt that has becom evid in recent data and confirm by presid pool   s report   this is offset over  e by a strengthen of busi spend  the end to the inventori correct that we see in ip and ism statement  and a pickup in capit expenditur as busi feel more comfort that the expans will continu and that ani overbuild they did when incom growth was higher in those three or four year that presid  n was talk about has been absorb   like the rest of you  i see a pickup in demand to someth like the growth rate of potenti some  e next year as hous activ adjust to the lower level of demand and as inventori is work off   sever favor factor support this eventu return to potenti  support financi condit  especi for busi  credit avail  which we   ve just been talk about  narrow credit spread  low long term rate  and good foreign demand   anoth upward adjust in this  book to rest of the world econom growth  and the declin in the dollar   which will support export   i use the staff structur growth of     percent   it seem to me that the adjust the staff made were small  offset in particip and product  and look reason given the recent data   there is still a tension between the labor data and have potenti growth as high as it is  and it leav the staff in a posit in which labor forc particip is slight abov the trend  which strike me as where it ought to be when the unemploy rate is slight below the nairu   also  product is slight below the trend  so they need fa  than trend product growth just to get back to their now lower trend  which strike me as where it ought to be after three or four quarter of below trend growth and presum some labor hoard  but not that much below trend   so that look like a reason assumpt to me  and that   s what i use in my project  i differ from the  book in a coupl of respect   one is that i had softer equiti and hous price than the staff did   on the equiti front   i think i said this last  e   i expect equiti price to be soft  and they   re up   percent    laughter   fortun  i don   t back my predict with my person wealth   but   i   m go to hold to that predict    laughter  the market still seem to be build in a more rapid increas in profit than seem consist with moder nomin gdp growth and some rebalanc of the labor capit share  which we may be begin to see   certain  there is practic no growth at all in domest profit in the  book for         now  the market may get more from the foreign profit  as peopl have been say  but i think there is potenti for disappoint there   on hous price  inventori are larg  and the price to rent ratio is still extrem high   on the demand side  i think demand is be damp by tighten in subprim and alt a market   on the suppli side  there will be some more foreclosur  particular as rate adjust up this year   so i presum that price will need to drop somewhat  rather than just stay level as in the staff forecast  even to get the hous stabil and eventu slight rebound that the staff and i includ in our real gdp forecast  now  to offset the effect of weak in wealth from these price  i had a slight eas of monetari polici this year  next year  and the follow year     percentag point each year   to get that same output   this was onli a slight eas in real rate given that inflat is edg down and inflat expect aren   t presum to chang veri much   i did this in the context of what i would have as an interim inflat target of   percent   i think   percent is achiev without signific output loss   it is low by histor standard and broad consist with price stabil and minim welfar distort relat to     percent   i agre that a littl lower might be nice eventu  but i would get there opportunist by lean against ani increas and accept decreas rather than deliber go to     percent   i   m skeptic about the expect effect that might accru from the announc of a     percent commit  a second differ with the  book is that i assum a slight lower nairu      percent   ani point es  is silli   we realli have onli the vaguest idea   but it seem to me that the compens data  the price data  of the past few year were more consist with a nairu that was a bit below     and so i assum    percent   as a consequ  i had slight less inflat than the staff forecast       in       and in         so i had     in       and     in       and had it stay there in         in some sens i thought the more interest part of the forecast was think about the second moment   the skew and the probabl around the central tendenc   i confess that for       i commit the sin of think thing were more uncertain than usual  mr  chairman    laughter   i hate it when i hear peopl say that
they   re alway more uncertain than usual    laughter
so here is my reason   i thought that the averag includ lot of episod of more or less steadi growth in steadi state and then other episod of cyclic adjust   in my mind  we were in the middl of a kind of mini cycl  which was an adjust from greater than sustain growth to growth that we hope is sustain   we   ve seen that the adjust had alreadi creat some inventori overhang and some chang in capit spend plan   so i thought that  becaus we   re not at a steadi state  thing might be a littl more uncertain than usual   but i compens for that by narrow my confid band in       and        laughter  when i think we   ll be close to a kind of a steadi state  on the skew part  like presid    i had downsid skew on output   it wasn   t so much hous becaus i think that  with the adjust to demand or activ that   s in the staff forecast and my own adjust to price  the risk around that are approxim balanc   nor was it a spread of problem in the subprim market to other credit market  i think we   ve seen enough sinc the subprim problem start to be pretti sure that the risk is no more than the normal kind   rather  the risk i saw was from concern about the financi posit and the psycholog of the household sector and the interact of those with hous   so it was a spillov in some sens from hous to consumpt   the financi oblig ratio is veri high   household  as presid   note  are high leverag   one of the surpris to me in the develop of subprim market was appar how mani borrow and lender were count on the futur appreci in hous just to support the debt servic  to say noth of the consumpt that must be go on at the same  e   i suspect that this is more widespread than just the subprim market   how mani household were expect price appreci to continu more as it did befor rather than to slow down or even for price to declin  as i think they will   it   s hard to say   but i suspect there are a lot of these household  and i think we could get some feedback there   the staff has the save rate actual declin in the second and third quarter  and there might be some technic reason for that   even to get modest consumpt growth  we see a veri gradual uptrend in the save rate over  e   that might be the most like outcom  but it did suggest to me that there is at least some fatter tail on the possibl that household  see what   s happen in the hous market and to their financi oblig  will draw back more quick from spend  when presid   and i were in basel  the most popular question to us was whether capit spend would realli pick up again   a number of central banker doubt that that could happen as long as consumpt wasn   t grow more rapid   but i   m comfort with the capit spend pattern so long as the consumpt pattern look someth like the pattern in the  book and like the one that i have as my most like outcom  more general  as you point out at one point last fall  mr  chairman  i think we   re in a veri unusu situat of below potenti growth for an extend period   a situat that is pretti much unpreced without break out one way or anoth   some nonlinear is go to come up and bite us here  and  as i see it  the nonlinear is most like in the household sector  now  if incom proceed along the expect path  it seem to me that there are upsid risk to inflat move down to   percent and stay there in our forecast   i think that overal we   re face a more difficult inflat environ than we have for the past ten year or so   the high level of resourc util  rise import price from the declin in the dollar and the high level of demand relat to potenti suppli global  includ in the emerg market economi   one thing we heard in basel was that increas number of these economi are have troubl  il their reserv accumul and are run into inflat pressur from that happen   higher price for energi  food  and other commod  higher headlin inflat  and possibl even slower trend product growth   i didn   t see a downsid skew to ani of these thing   but  as i thought about the whole pictur with all these thing seem to tilt a bit on one side and their interact  it seem to me that there was some upsid risk to the possibl that inflat expect would rise rather than stay where they are as assum in my most like outcom   now  for polici purpos  i would weight the upsid risk to inflat more than the downsid risk to growth  but we   ll get to that later in the day   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   my own view on the economi haven   t chang much sinc we last met and aren   t terribl at odd with the  book   i   d highlight a coupl of reason for concern  a coupl of area in which the miss could be sever   i share the view express by mani around the tabl  most recent by governor kohn  on the inflat front   i remain quit concern about inflat prospect  and i   m keep a wari eye on inflat expect  particular if there were to be acceler in the trend on commod price or the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   my sens is that the market haven   t fulli taken into account what that could be  and we could find the market more preoccupi with an inflat scare than they appear to be at this moment   so i think that  dure the balanc of        the inflat risk tend to be more signific than the growth risk  and i would expect to see sequenti increas in gdp  as in the  book  as we go through the next sever quarter  the big point of what that is predic on is realli the continu accommod in the credit market and the capit market  as sever peopl have note  i was think about my project and  as we look to       and        the bigger risk there tend to be more polici orient as we head into the next elect  and they may well have some effect on the capit market   so as i think about the second half of       and the first half of       and what the like gdp implic would be  i can   t help but think that chang or perceiv chang in tax polici and trade polici could be the biggest driver to the capit market and  as a result  have the biggest effect on the macroeconomi   so there are huge risk  as i look beyond        in term of where gdp might come out  but as a central case  the  book formul look rough in accord with my own  let me spend a moment on consumpt   my view is broad consist with what other have said earlier today   i spoke in the past week with one credit card compani whose custom base is similar to the averag aggreg custom base in the unit state   they have about one fifth of all credit card spend  and they report to me their april result  which might provid us with some clue about pce growth and credit qualiti   card spend for april  from their perspect  was consist with moder deceler in real consumpt   they end up in april with nomin year over year growth of about   percent in non auto retail sale  which is a slowdown from the fourth quarter of       and a slowdown from januari  but it is up a bit from februari and march  when they were get quit despond and were worri a bit about their project for the next three quarter   they think their april number look okay  quit consist with the moder deceler that mani folk here have talk about   they believ that they have hit the floor on that  but  e will tell   what they have not been abl to do  at least up to the  e of my discuss with them  is to break out retail purchas outsid fuel to find out whether less strength is there than the   percent top line number would suggest   i suspect that would be the case   how all this fit into market expect we   ll know over the next coupl of day   this strike me as an averag  okay number that may be a touch better than market expect  but it shouldn   t give us a whole lot of comfort if we   re tri to suggest that there is a robust recoveri on consumpt and pce   credit qualiti remain veri strong across consum credit and the compani   s mortgag product   i would note that they don   t have much subprim in their portfolio   what is subprim has fallen to that level rather than have begun there when they issu the credit   payment rate  use of credit line  delinqu  charg off   all are at veri posit level with littl indic of more serious weaken of consum demand   so  again  i think the prospect outlin by the  book in term of pce look broad consist with the april number  let me turn now to the capit market and the credit market and speak about three or four observ that may be a bit more newsworthi than when we last met six week ago  first  i will talk a littl about the dearth of default in corpor loan  then spend a coupl of moment on privat equiti  build on bill     s discuss at the outset on the correl among asset class  and final spend a moment on the shakeout in the mortgag market   the predic for this is someth that we all know  and sever peopl have spoken about earlier today   as corpor america has becom more cautious  wall street has becom more aggress to satisfi investor    appetit for risk   so we   re see risk avers in one categori on main street and real risk seek behavior on wall street   financi risk take remain high and may well have even increas sinc we last met   if you   ll look at the move option index measur one month volatil on treasuri  it   s the lowest it has been in about nine year  sinc the index came into be  and it suggest presid     s point that all the forc of liquid and froth that might be in the market are probabl more present today than ani of us could have imagin given the tumult in the market in late februari   at the same  e  nonfinanci corpor risk take continu to be more subdu than object measur would suggest it should be   there is reason to hope that the cap ex data will come around to where mani of us expect it to be alreadi  but some determin still need to be done on that   so we hear  and some of us even say  that these capit market appear price to perfect  that credit market are as strong as ever  and that liquid is plenti   i would add my concern to the implaus of that notion  which presid   and other spoke about   the reason for central banker to worri is  of cours  that these narrow spread provid less of a shock absorb for unforeseen event  let me now go through the point that i mention at the outset and describ their implic for the decis we make   first is the dearth of default on corpor loan  histor low year ahead default rate were referenc in the  book  and they should give us comfort  at least in theori   i share the  book view that corpor default should increas as profit level out and leverag increas to more normal level   but fewer default are even possibl in this financ environ  and that make me a littl less sanguin about those data  if we think about coven packag on corpor loan  both origin on wall street and origin at communiti bank   i think presid   spoke at a previous meet about coven lite deal   it is incred hard to get default in the context of these loan  never mind event of default notic and everyth els that would find it way into the indentur   as a result  we have seen a recent spate of financ with coven packag that are increas issuer friend  without trigger that would otherwis caus default   no debt payment schedul  never mind even the need to make interest payment  with the abil to turn those into sort of pay in kind note   all of that  it strike me  should make us nervous if busi fundament shift abrupt and investor are left with littl opportun to gain access to their capit or to be in a posit to forc compani to restructur their oper   as a result i am less sanguin about these low default data that we continu to receiv from wall street  a second point is the state of privat equiti in the capit market   what i note build on the recent histori that we   ve seen   massiv fund rais  larger lbos  increas leverag  in the past twelv month  we   ve seen the so call club deal phenomenon  the growth of equiti bridg  which i and other have talk about  and when we last met  we discuss the interest mani of these firm have for rush into the capit market by find perman capit   the newest develop is the growth of syndic in the equiti placement in these lbo market  the same way that we have syndic debt market that have matur incred over the past six to ten year  on the equiti side there are huge invest that are present be consid and potenti be made   so one lbo sponsor might fund a certain portion of the equiti check on an lbo and then line up  through an equiti syndic manag at a tradit invest bank or a commerci bank  the abil to sell down the rest of that equiti through an infrastructur and distribut system that is be built   i doubt that we will see that syndic market five year from now as deep and as larg as the debt market   but i do think that it show us that new liquid continu to come even to the privat placement     a  market alongsid the growth in the public capit market   that liquid could well improv tradabl   to the extent that these syndic are new  they show us that liquid is plenti  but they also show us that mani of these new mechan have not been stress test   the other implic of this boom in privat equiti is that it has rais the floor on equiti price   my sens is that there is a privat equiti put that may well have replac what use to be thought of as a feder reserv put on the floor of equiti price  and that equiti put appear to be larger than it has ever been  thus we have seen increas total leverag through these structur product  credit market  as i   ve mention  are more robust  and there is a question of stress test  which is still to be determin  anoth point on the capit market relat to what bill said about the correl among asset class   ceo  cfos  and chief risk offic of larg financi firm have found quit troubl the greater correl among asset class than most of their intern model had suggest   as they look at their dashboard in the week after the tumult that we saw last februari  they grew increas uncomfort about whether they had accur measur what their firm    downsid risk are   certain it   s encourag  as bill show us  that there appear to be less correl over recent week   that   s a lesson be learn and relearn and test and retest in these institut   that they may be heed the wakeup call is good news  but  e will tell whether it will be enough to catch up befor problem aris in the market  my final point concern the consequ of a shakeout in the mortgag market   my sens is that  after the fallout in subprim  the market is becom more consolid with larger  more sophist lender that can more quick provid more market that satisfi custom    newest want   the success in these market of invest bank and hedg fund will go to those with scale  with strong distribut system  and with control over their servic busi  so that they are effect abl to engin workout and avoid the need to foreclos  i think that over the balanc of this year we will hear more news from small and medium size commerci bank that feel as though their market share is be taken away dure this tumult  and that is someth that we need to continu to observ   with that  mr  chairman  i   ll save the rest of my comment for the next round
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   the last  e we met  one theme was the greater uncertainti  and governor kohn mention that he is feel greater uncertainti now than he ever had   i am not sure that greater uncertainti has been the tenor of the comment here today  but i think it has been greater uncertainti with downsid risk   so the key issu from last  e that i think is still with us is that we certain saw evid of the slowdown and  as presid  n mention  that some  we have to acknowledg realiti  and we did have much slower growth than mani peopl had been expect in the two previous meet   the  book suggest that the slowdown is unlik to persist   and i broad agre with that view  as do mani peopl around the tabl   but i want to review five key uncertainti that we talk about last  e and to discuss how they develop and where they are like to go  the first uncertainti is invest  and of cours  a lot of us have spoken about that   i would rate the level of uncertainti as still elev there   i am not go to use color code to rate that uncertainti  but i would say it is still elev   we have recent gotten some more solid number  but those are just recent  and i think it is still more a glimmer of hope than someth we can bank on that we are go to get a turnaround in invest   that we have seen some better number in ism  durabl good  and so forth say that the direct is perhap a littl more posit than we were think six week ago   but there is still a reason amount of uncertainti about whether the pickup in busi invest will help offset ani slowdown in consumpt to make sure that we continu to grow in the   percent rang go forward  the second uncertainti is product and potenti output   obvious that is still at an elev level   as far as i am concern  it is one of the biggest challeng for us to think about in the intermedi run   in particular  a downsid scenario that concern me is that  if we do not have a pickup in invest  we are unlik to see a sustain rise in product growth   if perhap one reason for the lower invest is that there are concern about product growth or return from that invest  we could have a fair negat scenario in which we get much lower potenti output   offset that concern is that we are see some glimmer of hope on invest   with respect to potenti  i think it is appropri that the  book has rais particip rate a bit  given that older peopl seem to be healthier than previous cohort were and seem to be more will to work   howev  i think the big question mark is  exact as   said  that not until august will we get a better feel for which way the data revis will go becaus the differ between the two side of the balanc sheet is fair big   broad  i share gari  n   s op  that it is not a good bet to bet against the u s  economi and against ul  good product growth   but i have the concern that i do not fulli understand the slow of the invest recoveri and some of the product slowdown   there is potenti a worri downsid scenario there  third is the uncertainti about the hous market and subprim   well  obvious  uncertainti on subprim was high elev then  and it has come down quit a bit   we have seen some tighten of lend standard  particular at the lower end   the survey of senior loan offic ask for a differenti between subprim and prime lend standard   it show a veri dramat increas in subprim standard  which is exact what we would expect in this kind of market  certain potenti reduc demand at least in the lower end of the hous market  about the hous market in and of itself  the uncertainti is still there   we still have a lot of uncertainti about whether the number are tell us about weather or about the actual strength of the market   as i think i have mention to a number of you befor  we need to have  besid dave  a meteorologist on the staff to forecast the weather becaus everi number we hear on the hous market is not a number in which we can put ani stock  it all has to do with heat or cold or rain or snow or whatev other thing that mother natur may throw at us   so i still think there is a pretti mix pictur there   as i said  we have seen veri littl evid of spillov from the subprim market   the main concern  and this is a variat of what governor   said  is that someth we or the congress might do might cut off this market   we have to be mind of ani action that we may be take with respect to guidanc  as well as of ani action that the congress may be take  that could reduc this market more than otherwis  the yield curv is favor for a lot of the variabl rate subprim borrow to move into fix rate product  with payment shock of perhap no more than    basi point   the delinqu we have been see have not been due to reset or to payment shock   they have been due primarili to the so call juvenil delinqu   the earli default go bad   that mean that we do not know what is come down the line becaus we have not realli seen the experi of the reset   now  with the recent benign yield curv  that situat could reason be work out   the key is whether ani equiti is left   if no equiti is left and the reset come  these guy are like to walk   if they have been do risk layer   put realli no money down   and the price go down  that will be a problem   so i think that may be a bit of a slow burn   coupl with the broader misalign that we are see now of a littl increas in hous start  which in some way we would see as a posit  is a sort of negat given that hous sale seem to be declin so much   thus there seem to be a disconnect between suppli and demand  and i think the  book is now quit wise say that we will like have a longer transit in the hous market  a fourth area of uncertainti that we talk about last  e was the financi market   the dramat spike up in volatil   that volatil spike has come down  but we  be good economist  can never be satisfi with either high volatil or low volatil   low volatil is of concern to us  and i veri much share the concern that    cathi  kevin  and other have mention   not onli in the unit state  but also in the rest of the world  are some of those spread a bit narrow than they otherwis would be   in particular  there are concern about bank chase privat equiti deal go coven free   in mani of my discuss with privat equiti folk  instead of say  well  bring us on more capit  those contact are the one say that the bank are push them to take greater leverag than they otherwis would want   now  if that isn   t the fox guard the henhous  i do not know what is   you want the bank to be the disciplinari forc  and that they would potenti be take on veri larg risk is a real concern  the fifth area of uncertainti was consumpt   we have seen a bit of a step down in consumpt growth  but there is still a lot of uncertainti  and i share the exact concern that governor kohn articul  given that there are like to be some wealth effect  even though we have some offset effect in the stock market  i do not want to bet on those offset effect in the stock market be there for the next three quarter   hous wealth seem to be flatten  if not come down  with the case shiller index on averag for those ten market down   to   percent  if peopl   s think about their consumpt pattern is base on some increas in hous wealth  the save rate should at least gradual increas   at some point  that realiti may be bite and lead to some concern  on the inflat front  onc again  we will have continu uncertainti about what drive short term to intermedi term inflat   as i mention last  e  we get veri  veri mild effect from the tradit thing that we think that make a differ   oil  energi  commod price  and resourc util don   t seem to have that much forc  but in both the short and intermedi term i think they are lean on the posit side rather than on the negat side   we still have the owner    equival rent issu that is come in with the transit in the hous market and is still to some extent temporarili push up our measur inflat rate   inflat expect continu to seem to be quit well contain  and that  i think  is key becaus  given that these other forc do not seem to be import in the short to intermedi run  inflat expect are veri import  so my bottom line is that  although i see some downsid risk on growth  i think the  book scenario is a reason central tendenc one  and i see some import upsid risk on inflat
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i would character where we are compar with the last meet as that we have gone through a soft patch  which was more extens than we expect   but the basic longer term outlook is realli the same as the one that we had the last  e around   that is what is realli relev to our polici decis becaus our polici decis now do not affect the economi until a year or two down the road  look at the issu of the risk  i was most worri at the last meet about what was happen in busi fix invest  particular becaus i did not realli understand what was go on  and it is alway the case that  when you have knightian uncertainti  you get much more nervous   the number have come in a bit better on those ground  so i am a littl less worri about busi fix invest   but then we have had a downshift in hous  which again was unexpect   so when i put those thing togeth  i think that we are in a situat of a fair amount of uncertainti   mayb i am a littl less worri about the uncertainti and the downsid risk  although i think they are still there  onli becaus in the hous case  from the point of view of the longer run fundament  i do not see a big problem   it realli is an inventori correct issu  which we are tri to sort out   that is creat uncertainti  but it creat more uncertainti in the shorter term rather than in the longer term   even though there is still uncertainti with the issu of busi fix invest  it may be a littl bit less   so perhap there is a slight skew on the downsid in term of my confid interv  but a littl less than last  e  if that give me ani comfort  about the inflat issu  i am more op ist than the  book   i see inflat come down to     percent by the end of      and then to   percent and stay there thereaft   my reason here  i think  is familiar to you   i consid long run inflat expect to be a key driver of the inflat process   i see those number as around   percent  and unless we make a concert effort to chang inflat expect  i think that is where they will stay   also  i am confid that we will do the right thing to make sure that inflat expect do not go up from there  and i think the market have similar confid in that regard  when i look at the risk in term of inflat  of most concern to me is the issu of what has happen to structur product   we have number come in that we realli cannot fulli explain   mayb there is just someth a bit wrong with     s law  and product will revert back to it  and then we   re okay   but mayb there is actual someth more  that we have had such tight labor market when  in fact  the economi has been grow at quit a slow pace   there is a real question about what this may mean   if structur product is actual downshift more than we expect  that   creat a serious inflat risk that we have to be veri concern about   on the other side is the issu about whether we realli are in tight labor market   you look at the number in term of compens and so forth  and they don   t look too bad   this might tell us is that the nairu may be somewhat lower   again  if we even know exact what the nairu concept mean   which is the issu of knightian uncertainti  not normal uncertainti   so in this context  the basic forecast outlin that we have is actual a fair benign one   i am will to bet that it is probabl the most reason forecast to have   i am pretti comfort with it   but we will have to wait to see what kind of data come in   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   let me tri to summar the discuss around the tabl and take ani comment on the summari  and then i would like to add just a few thought  broad speak  the outlook of most particip has not substanti chang sinc march  hous remain weak  and it is the greatest sourc of downsid risk   whether the demand for hous has stabil remain difficult to judg  in part becaus of subprim issu   it is also unclear whether builder will seek to return inventori to histor level  and if so  at what rate  there is yet no indic of signific spillov from hous to other sector  although that remain a risk   the downsid risk to invest have moder sinc the last meet  although invest seem unlik to be a strong driver of growth   the inventori cycl is now well advanc  and product is strengthen   consumpt growth seem like to moder  reflect factor such as weak in hous price and high energi price   howev  the labor market remain strong  particular in the market for high skill worker   incom generat by the labor market  togeth with gain in the stock market and general accommod financi condit  should provid some support for consumpt go forward   financi market are price for perfect  which impli some risk on that score   foreign economi remain strong and should be a sourc of support  although some are undertak monetari tighten   overal  the economi is in a soft patch and will like grow below trend for a while   growth should return to potenti later this year or in       depend on the evolut of the hous market   the rate of potenti growth remain hard to pin down   sever particip seem a bit more op ist than the  book on potenti growth and the nairu  although there are risk  inflat has improv a bit  and most see continu but veri slow moder   howev  there are upsid risk to inflat  includ compens  the dollar  energi price  and a slow in product   moreov  a rise in inflat from current level would be cost  particular if it involv unhing inflat expect   vigil on inflat must  therefor  be maintain  overal the risk and uncertainti seem a bit less pronounc than at the last meet  and particip seem relat comfort with the outlook   although there are some potenti signific downsid risk to output  aris particular from the hous sector and the possibl spillov to consumpt  the group still appear to view a failur of inflat to moder as expect to be the predomin risk to longer term stabil   are there ani comment or question  hear none  i will just add a few point   first  follow presid    i think that the tension between slow growth and a strong labor market remain central to understand what   s go on       s law is suppos to work better than this    laughter   i look at recent histori  over the past twenti year or so  there has been no exact parallel to what we are see now   there was a jobless recoveri in             in which unemploy remain high even though growth was pick up  and we had a midcycl slowdown in       and        which was relat short and not veri sever  in which the unemploy rate got temporarili ahead of growth   so there have been some deviat   interest  after the      recess  despit lot of talk about jobless recoveri      s law work pretti well   so we are in an unusu situat   instead of a jobless recoveri  we have growthless job growth    laughter  interpret this correct is veri import   the staff forecast essenti assum that     s law will revert to histor tendenc   i think that assumpt is reason  particular sinc the staff is not except op ist about potenti growth and  therefor  that particular sourc of error is moder   that would suggest that labor hoard is probabl a good part of what is happen here   if there is one area in which labor hoard appear to be signific  it would be construct  as presid   mention   i ask the staff to do a simpl studi of this relationship  to which dave   refer   andrew figura and adam looney of the board   s staff perform a regress analysi in which they regress all construct employ against all invest in structur quarter with lag go back to        the reason to look at all construct in term of both employ and product is that there is a lot of substitut between those two categori   that regress approach should also account for unmeasur labor  includ undocu worker and the like   in this analysi they found that employ is rough proport to construct activ  but with substanti lag  which again is somewhat surpris   inde  the model fit well through the fourth quarter of       but then begin to underpredict signific in the first quarter of         if this model is correct  then given what is alreadi in the pipelin in term of reduc construct activ and then go on with the forecast in the  book  we should begin to see fair signific declin in construct employ on the order of        per month over the next year  which would be suffici in itself  with all els be equal  to add     to     to the unemploy rate   so if labor hoard explain the failur of     s law  then we may soon see some gradual rise in the unemploy rate  which would also be consist with the view that the staff has taken that a good bit of the slowdown in product is cyclic  it is actual fair difficult to calcul the contribut of the construct sector to product becaus it involv not just construct worker but also upstream product of various kind   but one es   which come from discuss with the council of econom advis  had the implic of employ hoard in construct be about    percentag point on product growth   we will see how that develop   even though i believ  as   the staff  that we will see some soften in the labor market  i should say that the evid is still quit tentat   we saw a bit of weak in the last labor report  but unemploy insur claim remain low  and we do not realli see a signific indic  the other major issu is the hous market   again  as a number of peopl point out  this is an inventori cycl problem   the two main determin of an inventori cycl are     what the level of final demand is and     how quick you move to bring inventori back to normal   there   seem to have been some step down in final demand over the past few month   assum that homebuild would like to get not all the way to but signific toward their last ten year    inventori by the end of      impli fair weak construct  not onli in the second quarter but go into the third quarter as well   onli in the fourth quarter will we see a relat minor subtract from gdp   that   s also relat specul  but residenti construct   seem fair like to me to be more of a drag than we previous thought and to continu to be a problem into the third quarter  there will also be a slowdown in consumpt   we have been have rate near   percent  which is certain not sustain   we alreadi see indic that consumpt may be closer to   percent in the second quarter   i think the hous price effect are go to show up   gasolin price will have an effect   the labor market is strong  but it is go to slow a bit   so it look to me as though under growth is rough   percent and will be so for a coupl of quarter to come  notic in the think about the under case that there has been quit an asynchron between privat domest final demand and product late   for exampl  for the second quarter we expect to see weaker privat domest final demand but probabl a stronger gdp number becaus of rebound in net export and the like   but we should look past that   those are just quarter to quarter variat   and observ that growth is moder  an observ that is support by the sens that industri product and manufactur seem to be pick up   to summar  i think that the notion of moder growth with some uncertainti and with return toward potenti later in the year or earli next year is still probabl about the right forecast  on inflat  there   s the famous stock market predict that price will fluctuat   that seem to be true also for inflat   i mention at the last meet that the month standard deviat in inflat number is about       and so between     and     there is not necessarili a whole lot of inform   we have a few piec of good news   i think vacanc rate are rise for both apart and singl famili home   at some point we will begin to see better progress on owner    equival rent and shelter cost   also  the quarter averag of medic cost increas was much more moder than in the first two month  which suggest that mayb this risk is not as serious as it may have look   howev  as mani peopl point out  there are a number of negat  includ the dollar  energi  food price  commod price  and most import  the labor market   the compens data remain quit mix   in particular  the eci  which was a veri soft headlin number   the     percent quarter wage and salari number  or     percent for twelv month  is now more or less consist with what we   re see in averag hour earn   if product fall below   percent  then we are begin to get to a rang in which unit labor cost will be put pressur on inflat   so i am quit comfort with the view express around the tabl that  although inflat look to be stabil and perhap fall slowli  there are signific risk to inflat and we should take those veri serious  veri much a side point   i did have some interest discuss with the staff about the role of the stock market in the forecast   this is not the staff   s fault  but there is a sort of tension in how the stock market is treat   on the one hand  the stock market is assum to grow at     percent from the current level   on the other hand  the forecast has profit growth go essenti to zero by the third quarter but interest rate come up   those two thing are a littl hard to reconcil  the difficult problem is which way you should go to reconcil it   on the one hand  it could be that the forecast is right  and therefor the stock market will in fact be weaker  that will have implic for stabil  for consumpt  and so on   on the other hand  perhap we should be take inform from the stock market in make our forecast   so it is a veri difficult problem  and i just want to point out the tension that we will have to see resolv over the next few quarter   one partial resolut is that  as has been note  the stock market and the economi as a whole can be decoupl to some extent becaus of oversea profit   this is an interest exampl of how financi global is creat stabil for domest consumpt   you know  decoupl domest consumpt from domest product   again  we had a veri good discuss with the staff about this issu  and i think it is just someth we will need to think about go forward  in summari  in the last meet we felt that uncertainti had risen   there has been perhap a slight moder of those concern at this point   a littl less inflat risk  a littl less growth risk  nevertheless  the balanc of risk with inflat be the greater still seem to me to be a reason approach   let me now turn to   to begin the polici go round
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that were pass around dure the coffe break   for the past few year  the committe has taken a    belt and suspend    approach to provid guidanc

and the minut   i take from this the sens that the word of the statement is import  laughter   but that there are also other opportun to provid a more nuanc polici messag   the messag that market particip got both from you and from the incom data  on net over the intermeet period  is seen in the top right panel by the shift from the dot red to the solid black line depict the path of the

as the spread between the forward earn price ratio and the long term real interest rate   narrow a bit  suggest that investor were more accept of risk   also  investor may see less risk  as in answer c   potenti bad thing that seem palpabl as the subprim market melt down did not go bump in the night   that is  downsid risk to the outlook appear to eas   what is the right answer to this multipl

identifi the failur of inflat to moder from it current elev level to be the predomin concern   the case for altern c  present in the right panel  probabl hing on the view that inflat is not clear on a

the discuss of communic  the committe thus far has been reluct to specifi an inflat goal consist with it dual mandat   howev  by describ current inflat as    somewhat elev     as was the case in march  you are implicit character the upper limit of your toler for inflat  just as you delimit it lower bound in the summer of      with talk of    unwelcom disinfl      market particip will read much into your choic of word when the  e come to chang that character   so  at some point  you will have to come to term with your prefer specif of your inflat goal  either direct through deliber on communic polici or indirect through the word of the statement   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   are there question for     if not  we can begin the polici go round
i guess by default i will start   first of all  i favor altern b  both the languag and the unchang feder fund target   let me make a coupl of comment about market liquid   first  liquid is not reduc at all by deal   deal simpli transfer the fund from the buyer to the seller  who then have to figur out what to do with all that cash   deal are probabl be driven at least in part by veri narrow risk spread   but my sens is that so far these spread are consist with actual loss in the market   obvious  if that situat continu  then risk spread should remain low  and we should continu to have a veri activ amount of deal make  some of the return from the deal realli feed into good product perform becaus part of the purpos of these deal is to take over compani that are not perform well and to elimin margin profit or unprofit oper and that is realli good for product   to the extent that the deal are simpli increas leverag   sort of financi engin   then that   not do anyth for product   it   increas risk and vulner should the economi perform other than anticip   we cannot realli do anyth about that situat except to avoid creat surpris ourselv  it is realli  on the whole  beyond our control   governor kohn talk about standard error  and i must say that  when it come to standard error  i am veri much an index and not a market  er    laughter   it is easi to fool yourself just as in invest polici  but that is where i come out there  on the issu of the inflat target   and i am glad that we are close in on this topic   i honest do not believ that we can credibl be satisfi with an inflat forecast for       that far out  of   percent and at the same  e continu to talk about a comfort zone of   to     that   not seem to me to be intern consist becaus we cannot control inflat to     percentag point  so either we have to decid that our true target is someth like     plus or minus    as an issu for control error and other consider  or we need to start be explicit about a comfort zone of     to       i am worri about the latter approach becaus it run the risk of rais market expect and of unhing expect   expect have been veri solid held   if we get into a situat in which  through inevit thing that happen that we cannot control  the inflat rate were to run consist at  let   s say for the sake of argument      instead of around    then those market expect might not be so well entrench at     as a consequ of have will and open or by default   by reveal prefer  if you will   move effect to rais the comfort zone   i am veri much a hardlin on this   i think that we ought to continu with a comfort zone of   to    and we ought to think about the inflat target as be     plus or minus a half   thank you
thank you   presid pool   s comment remind me that i did have a question      it is  what do you think is the effect of the term    on balanc    in the inflat paragraph
we ad the term    on balanc    in draft the bluebook for both the  e seri and the cross section perspect   that is  first  from the  e seri perspect you are not look at just one month number   you may be do as complic an analysi as presid  n in look at three   six   and twelv month chang   second  it has a cross section aspect to it   you are not just focus on the one number of core pce  but you   re take in the whole suit of price index
well  let   s just say core inflat  so it wouldn   t be everi inflat measur
yes  but you are not hang your hat necessarili on the pce versus the cpi   the thought is that the insert of that languag mean that you   re tend to smooth through recent observ  and we took it as someth that would be on balanc    laughter  that phrase come veri natur to us  too   a littl more hawkish
sorri   which was a littl more
to take it out would be a littl more hawkish
it would be a more hawkish signal than a statement with    on balanc
i agre with that last statement
mr  chairman   in the same vein  may i just ask a question about the like conclus that peopl would draw from the chang in the second section  it has the virtu of truth    laughter   you could interpret it  relat to march  as a softer character of the recent news   it goe in a slight differ direct from the center of graviti of this discuss  which is to say that indic have actual been mix   they are some  a littl softer or some  a littl stronger  but we think there is mayb a slight thinner advers tail in the growth outcom than we had thought in march   i am not particular troubl by that   but  vinc  do you think that this would be the plausibl read by the market to the chang  how would they interpret the intent of the chang in section
that it was a recognit of the incom inform   i think an import chang is also to take out the    to continu to expand    and leav it as just    to expand    becaus the first quarter did not have moder econom growth   so that part say that you are acknowledg the most recent number   again  the first claus is basic acknowledg that the first part of the year  not just the first quarter  will potenti be kind of slow   so more than anyth it say that the committe is look through this soft patch  without use the phrase    soft patch
mr  chairman  may i ask a question
are you advoc that  if we use the text as written in section   of altern b  we would still keep the full word from section   from last  e
the word of section   would be unchang  yes
that may mitig some of those concern you have
sinc we are bring these suggest out earli  one thing that you could do in section    the second sentenc  is simpli make an assert about moder growth   one could say     overal  howev  recent indic suggest that the economi seem like to expand           suggest that the news recent has been somewhat more posit   that is just a thought   let   s go to presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  earlier in talk about the economi i said that i thought the extend outlook was reason favor in term of prospect for growth and that i also expect a modest diminut in core inflat  assum that polici would be sustain approxim where it is   that lead me direct to favor altern b as the polici choic  put it the other way around  i do not see compel reason to make a chang at this point  so i think we should stay where we are  as far as languag is concern  the bulk of the languag under altern b is fine with me   but i do have one suggest  which is that we replac the second sentenc in section    altern b  which talk about inflat  with the second sentenc in section    altern c  which emphas uncertainti   i advoc that for sever reason  but realli they boil down to my think that it better describ the situat in which we find ourselv   so let me just elabor a littl   we know that the nairu is at best an imprecis concept   we know that accur measur of product is difficult and that  therefor  so is es  of potenti real gdp  the output gap  and so on and so forth   inde  simul in the  book address those two issu precis  and there has been a fair amount of discuss recent at this meet about uncertainti about the nairu and about product and so on    that lead me to my suggest   i would also observ that it is certain not far fetch to imagin   although this is not my forecast   that the unemploy rate or some other measur of slack may move up for a  e while inflat remain stubborn where it is or even increas a touch   so all of that lead me to favor the languag from altern c for that one sentenc
presid  n  would you add the same word on the output side   do you think it   s worth emphas uncertainti about inflat without also emphas the uncertainti about output   although a lot of peopl have said it has narrow relat to last  e  a lot of peopl have also said that the hous situat is veri uncertain
i haven   t thought about that   but if you want to say that the economi seem like to expand  we could  i suppos  soften that a bit to emphas uncertainti there as well  although my sens of thing is that peopl do  in fact  expect moder growth go forward
intervent  presid
no  sir   i just want to comment
whi don   t you go ahead
well  again  i am probabl the most bearish in term of a short term forecast on gdp growth and have veri asymmetr confid band  which take into account even slower growth than that   have listen to the convers at the tabl and key off the word    hawkish    that vinc use  i want to be owlish on growth in term of listen to presid  n   s admonit  and i don   t want to be a pigeon on inflat   just to kill the aviari context here   laughter   so i would advoc altern b   i don   t believ that we should chang the rate   i like veri much the suggest that presid  n just made about inflat  the onli thing in your summari list  mr  chairman  that i did not hear and that i think is an issu is the behavior pattern of privat sector leader who were tri to figur out how to preserv their margin  therefor  i think we will have more sustain price    instinct    than i would otherwis see from the current data   i think the second sentenc in altern c captur that uncertainti  and i agre with presid  n   final  as alway  i would suggest that we add the word    global    befor    resourc util      thank you  mr  chairman
note   thank you
mr  chairman  may i ask just a clarifi question on this discuss
don rais the obvious question  which is whether we want to introduc the character of uncertainti on one piec of our outlook but not the other  but  gari  did you suggest that uncertainti about the inflat forecast is greater today than it was in march
not for me person   but as i thought more about this and listen to some of the convers  the uncertainti seem to be at least as great as it was in march   in fact  the  book mark up core inflat a touch   that  sn   t lead direct into greater uncertainti  but it is not the direct in which i would have gone if i were chang the inflat forecast
but is your rational most about greater uncertainti  or is it most a continu avers to implicit refer to the output gap as be a signific forc
i would like to interject   we do have to think about the  e seri natur of the statement  and i am concern  given that our last inflat read was veri good and reduc some of the anxieti that we were feel in the last meet  that there will be a lot of attempt to interpret what we meant by uncertainti   at this point  are we feel that there is an increas in uncertainti and that we have lost confid in this project   i think that we have to think veri serious  not just about the sentenc  which is veri reason on it face  but also about what extent the chang from the last statement will be overinterpret
i agre with that comment     percent  although i do think that is an issu we are go to confront if and when we ever make that chang  quit honest
may i make an intervent  mr  chairman
if you do use that sentenc  then you might be abl to get rid of the first sentenc in section   that you use previous
the core inflat sentenc   which one
in these circumst  the committe   s predomin    concern           sever   no
i am not argu that you includ both but that you could trade one off against the other
are there ani intervent   if not  presid
gosh  as usual the state of play here has gotten confus   for me  anyway   first of all  the thing i am least confus about is the polici recommend   i do not think we should do anyth at this  e   i think we should stay the cours at      i am veri much in favor of altern b  second  i want to comment about what vinc said about the reaction to our statement the last  e  in larg part becaus i found that the peopl who talk to me about it over the past sever week felt that our statement communic was somehow murkier than usual  if that is possibl   person  i felt that we were veri clear in that statement   we saw that there was more two side risk   and ul  the market has come around to that belief   i guess i have come to the view that it is not a bad thing that the market react a bit more strong   we probabl should have anticip that  and i think i even comment about it at the last meet   that when you make a chang to open a two way possibl for polici a littl more explicit  it will have a bigger impact on the overal market  third  with regard to the discuss about the languag in altern b  i was of the opinion that in term of growth we have a certain set of risk come from the hous market and rise energi and gasolin price  which to some extent was offset by continu strength in employ  the financi market ad to household wealth  the growth around the rest of the world  some brighter pictur from busi invest spend  and so forth   so i look at the growth part of this as a bit more balanc and somewhat less uncertain than last  e but at the inflat part as be more uncertain   so i was attract both to presid  n   s recommend and even to a recommend that would replac section   of altern b with section   of altern c   but i think about the chairman   s most recent comment about how strong the market might react to that  what it might say about what has been a nuanc discuss here about inflat   we all expect inflat   we in boston somewhat less than the rest of you   to moder over the next year or year and a half to someth that is within what some peopl have call their comfort zone   i am a littl worri that we might send a messag of more concern than we might have intend from replac that languag  although i agre with presid  n   i think the languag of altern c  particular with regard to uncertainti  is somewhat more reflect of what we talk around the tabl than the exist languag of section    final  i may be kid myself here  but i have been take the languag in section   as say not so much that we   re commit to a comfort zone of between   and    although i take presid pool   s comment on this serious  but rather that the dynam of inflat had the risk that inflat would acceler rather than deceler and that is what we were concern about  again  that is my person read on this becaus that is the context in which i think about concern about inflat at this  e   i would agre with presid pool that there is a way in which you can read this that is gradual push us into give a target and a target rang  and that may be where everybodi want to go here   i do not know  but i think there is a littl risk around a specif number  as i have said mani  e   i would agre with governor kohn and his comment about wonder whether we realli want to push inflat just for the sheer sake of push it to below   or  rather  wait for the abil to move opportunist at some point
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the recommend embodi by altern b   the committe last  e want to introduc a littl more flexibl into the statement while not send a messag that our resolv about achiev price stabil had chang  it took a while for that messag to get through  but it did   sinc not much has chang in the way the economi is unfold relat to our expect sinc the last meet  i would prefer to make onli the essenti adjust to the statement  such as acknowledg the recent slow in econom activ   in the spirit of make onli minim chang  i would not add the claus    on balanc    to the sentenc on core inflat   we had the benefit of ask what we were tri to convey with that phrase and heard     s comment about  e seri and cross section perspect  but the market aren   t go to have the benefit of that explan until they get the minut   i am also concern that introduc the languag about uncertainti around inflat is go to have the market tri to interpret what we are tri to say   they have a lower path to the fed fund rate built into their expect  and i think they have been look for languag to help support that posit  our say that we are uncertain about inflat may appear to them as a bit dovish rather than hawkish   so i would just rather keep thing where they are today  with veri few chang to our languag   i support altern b without    on balanc     but that is obvious not a show stopper   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like everyon els  i support the polici recommend of altern b  keep the fed fund rate unchang   i do think that has the best odd of help the economi meet our dual object of maximum employ and stabl price  financi condit right now  as sever peopl have remark  are realli quit support of growth  particular in the busi sector  but i think that is necessari to offset some of the drag from hous and from busi and household caution   the recent indic  it seem to me  have still a bit of a mix charact   we have one month of strength in capit spend  and we have some industri product and ism data  but consumpt has definit slow down   so to my mind there is still consider uncertainti  even if it is less than last  e  around the output path  given that i think thing are close to where they were befor  i wouldn   t make mani chang to the word from last  e   i am comfort with section   on econom growth and    expand at a moder pace over come quarter     unless we add someth about uncertainti to the inflat piec  and then i would want to add uncertainti to the other   but i do not think we ought to add the uncertainti languag to inflat   i think the combin of that and the    predomin    languag  as presid   was implicit point out  will send a much more concern messag about inflat   it will say that our concern about inflat have increas sinc last  e   i realli think it would be interpret that way   at some cost  we obtain some flexibl in how we are character the situat and in our polici expect by the chang we made last  e to the final section   i would keep that final section the same  and i would not do someth to undo that  which would be to combin the uncertainti languag on inflat and the predomin risk languag   i think that the world would see the feder reserv as be much more worri about inflat than it was last  e  even though the data have been a littl better  on section       core inflat remain somewhat elev on balanc      one question i ask myself was  if i had a   percent target and the latest number was      should i be much concern about that  or would i be comfort with the sentenc   i think i am okay with the sentenc for a coupl of reason   i   ll come to the    on balanc    in a second   one reason is that the latest data on core pce price are heavili influenc by those nonmarket compon that i   ve denigr at this tabl befor  and we can be consist there   the year over year cpi still show some acceler  much more acceler than pce   the market base pce show some acceler   so the rate is still higher than i am comfort with  especi when i discount the nonmarket part   the cpi is still pretti high  and i complet agre that inflat is our predomin concern   so i think say that core inflat remain somewhat elev is fine with me   presid pool said someth about that    we    as a committe continu with our comfort zone of   to   percent   for the sake of the transcript  i want to make it clear that the committe has never chosen such a comfort zone  sever individu have  and i agre with both presid pool and   that this could get awkward soon   but not yet   and we need to think about it   the committe   not have a comfort zone   with regard to the phrase    on balanc     i could live with the sentenc either way  unfortun it   s an ambigu phrase   i   m not sure how peopl will interpret it   was the thought that it would be more hawkish to take it out   i didn   t follow the dialogu between   and vice chairman   on what you thought the effect would be of do the section without    on balanc
the theori was that you were smooth through recent data so that  if you got anoth good read on core inflat  as you did last month  you wouldn   t necessarili weight it as much
don  you could take    on balanc    as acknowledg last month   s data  and if you take    on balanc    out  you   re not acknowledg last month   s data as much
may i also just ask a question   in presid  n   s formul  you would take the second sentenc from altern c and not make ani refer to resourc slack  so i would actual take that as market read that you have decid to total discount the current pressur on employ rather than increas your weight on inflat uncertainti   i took this as an invit to say disregard employ   you are not worri about slack as much  and you are just assert that inflat moder
i hadn   t thought about that  i confess   that make me even more uncomfort
i would view that as quit a dovish statement
well  i view it as a neutral statement    laughter
on the other side  we are anticip a slowdown in employ growth  so then  the market would look back to this and say     aha  the unemploy rate is rise   the fed is about to eas      the question is whether this is a good  e to get that notion out   i don   t feel veri strong one way or the other  but i think there is a lot to be said for leav it alon  given all the ambigu here   but basic i   m support of presid  n   s recommend
i would note that bloomberg today had a linguist evalu previous statement  and he basic conclud that the languag was pretti hopeless    laughter  speaker      who was this linguist
in fact  it was the chief editor of the american heritag dictionari
can we hire him as a consult    laughter
a meteorologist and a linguist
anticip that a linguist will be read this afterward  let me say  that i strong support altern b   sinc i   m assum that the languag is what we   re talk about  i support the current languag even though there have been mani suggest for modif   i am not inclin to make ani suggest myself or to accept ani of the other that have been put on the tabl unless you  as the chairman  decid to modifi this languag somewhat  i have a coupl of comment  though   governor kohn mention that we would have a long period in which we experi below trend growth  but from my perspect  that   s what we intend   we have had a period of modest tight polici  and therefor we should expect somewhat below trend growth with the object of bring in our inflat number   we are right on track with that  and that is where we ought to be stay   i am veri comfort with this modest tight polici   over  e it should systemat bring inflat down   i agre  again  with governor kohn   s earlier comment that we can do it in this way with minim cost to the economi  which is our object   to bring inflat down and to do it in the least cost way possibl   so we need to stick with this polici as we have defin it here   i would also point out  just for the record  that if you want to make sure that we are not get tie up into target  as i have said befor and will say again today  that i am not target on core pce   i much prefer core cpi   it is more easili understood   if that is the case  then the   percent number  if we have to talk about a number  make a lot more sens   we can get this ani way we want  but the point is that we need to bring the inflat number down systemat  and we are not yet where i think most of us in this room agre we should be   so where we are with the polici under altern b is  i think  a veri good choic for us   i will end with that
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as i listen to the comment around the tabl  i am of two mind   one  and i have said this befor  mayb we ought to be in the busi of chang the statement a lot more frequent to get out of some of our trap of  e seri languag  two  have said that  though  i think  as i indic earlier  that altern b is the correct one  we ought to hold the fed fund rate where it is   we are about in the right place for now   there is some question mark go forward in term of how thing evolv and where we want to be  but for now i am certain comfort where we are   if growth return to trend more rapid than the  book project  then we might ask ourselv other question  but i don   t think we   re there yet  acknowledg governor kohn   s comment  i have to confess that i think that bill   s comment   inde  taken off vinc   s   are appropri   we need to align ourselv here better in term of where we   re go and what we   re do   as we get closer  articul more precis where we are  at least among ourselv  becom even more critic   align our object with market expect and figur out how we get those thing into align is a critic task that we face  and i just would like to reinforc that  in term of word  i could live perfect well with altern b as written   i have a lot of sympathi for presid  n   s statement   i would like to simplifi our statement about inflat  in fact  if peopl are troubl by the notion of uncertainti  i would go so far as to stop after    inflat pressur seem like to moder over  e      i recogn that is probabl not the consensus view   as for the rest  i kind of like the chairman   s suggest   i think it was his   on some of the languag in section     in some way  if we don   t want to convey much to the market at this point  chang as littl as possibl seem to make sens  and i would be support of that  in fact  we could take the march statement in section   and leav it exact as it is except to take out    to continu      but the chairman   s suggest about mix signal would be fine with me  too   so i   m pretti flexibl at this point   the real nut to crack will be come up over the next quarter or two  when we will face some more difficult choic  i believ   so i   ll end with that
thank you   presid
polici should be straightforward today   we   re wait out a lull in growth while inflat is unaccept high  at least to most of us   when the downsid risk have suffici diminish  i   m presum we   re go to want to take action to bring inflat down  but in the mean   we are on the sidelin obvious with regard to rate  come into this i had thought the statement was go to be a pretti straightforward matter as well   evid not   market final figur out what we meant in the last statement   i think you are right  mr  chairman  in your autoregress model of the statement languag   the market do a kalman filter on whatev we issu and attach great import to whatev we chang   i do not think much has chang about the outlook to warrant signific chang in languag  although i   d be sympathet to take out    on balanc    on the theori that it is a hawkish move in general   laughter   about what gari said  i am realli sympathet to the notion of chang the way we refer to the relationship between resourc util and inflat in our statement   i say that becaus the best mainstream understand is that resourc util and inflat are the joint outcom of econom decis given our action and given what we   re expect to do   one can talk about resourc util affect inflat   one can just as well talk about moder inflat keep resourc util high   there is realli no superior to one character or the other   so the idea that a sort of independ thing is wag around there drive inflat  rather than both of them be the result of our action  is an area in which we could improv the public   s understand of our understand of how monetari polici affect the economi  i would also like to endors the spirit of presid pool   s remark about inflat and what we want   you know  about this notion of opportun or the idea of an interim target  i think again about my brother in law sit down in front of retir plan softwar   i guess i would be left tell him     well  you should put in between   and       depend on when we decid to take the opportun to reduc inflat below   percent   i do not think that   s satisfactori   i think we can do better   when we choos an object  we should view it as a onc and for all thing   part of that reflect a sens that  well  if transit cost are someth we are go to describ as keep us from go to where we now think we ought to be ul   what if shock bump us up to    or   percent   are we go to say the same thing then   i mean  it is invit peopl to think that  and it is just sort of paint ourselv into a corner   governor kohn  you refer to the net welfar cost of   versus     percent inflat   if you do the op  polici calcul  the onli thing that govern where you get in the long run  no matter how long it take  is that net welfar calcul  so that   s what should govern where we choos to set our object  not whether we think transit cost are go to be high now or not   that conclud my remark  mr  chairman
i think your point about joint causal  joint endogen  of util and inflat is a good one   i have tri to make that point in tes oni when i talk about aggreg demand be strong and have effect both on inflat and on resourc util   we can think about this   it is a littl hard to captur complex model in these statement  but it is certain a point well taken   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the bluebook   s altern b  both the polici and the languag as it stand   with respect to the languag  i strong support the view that you  governor kohn  and other express   that a chang today would be a mistak  given the signific that the market would attach to it   i think the languag is complet accept and we should stick with it   if we were to move  i wouldn   t have a problem with the languag in c about inflat and uncertainti  but i would also want to add someth about uncertainti with respect to growth  and i see no need to make this chang today   it seem to me that we do need consider flexibl at this point to respond to emerg data   the intermeet develop have strengthen the case for a soft land  but there is signific risk on both side with respect to inflat and growth   i   m still comfort state that the predomin polici concern is the risk that inflat will fail to moder as expect   i am worri about labor market that remain fair tight  oil and commod price that are higher  and the dollar  which has fallen   at the same  e  the recent favor inflat data have reinforc my view that a substanti part of the uptick in inflat last year was transitori   i think that the discuss we have had so far reinforc the point that go forward we are go to have troubl craft polici and a statement if we don   t clarifi   at least within the committe  if not public   what our ul  inflat object is   i   m not go to weigh in again at this point on the merit  but it is obvious that we will have increas difficulti   i am happi today to say that core inflat remain    somewhat elev on balanc     but if we get more read of core pce inflat that are in the neighborhood of   percent and they continu  we realli will have to revisit the debat about what we want to achiev and how we can reflect that decis in our statement
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   if you step back from the discuss and just think about the polici posit  we   re in a difficult posit becaus inflat continu to run higher than most of us think is appropri but econom activ seem to be in a soft patch  as you said in your summari of the comment  mr  chairman   i think altern b   keep the fed fund rate at    percent and the languag   is the appropri one for today   if we were to take the suggest of use the sentenc from altern c about consider uncertainti surround the inflat judgment  how would the market interpret this chang  regardless of how we meant it   i think the market would immedi interpret it as less emphasi on inflat from our standpoint   i think they would also say     well  there   s now more uncertainti  or the fomc see more uncertainti today about inflat than it did at the last meet      i don   t think either statement is accur  if we delet the phrase    high level of resourc util     they will say that we   re less concern about high level of resourc util than we were befor   we   ve had this phrase in the statement for a long  e   at some point we want to take it out  but when we do the chang to the statement would be veri signific   i wouldn   t do it until we felt that  in the context of look at the overal statement in a veri care way  make that chang had some major benefit   there is a virtu in make few chang in the statement unless we have a specif object in mind or a specif messag   so i would strong oppos make that chang in the statement   on the phrase    on balanc     i guess i was persuad by     s descript that this help us give the impress that we   re smooth through the recent data   so on balanc  i would keep    on balanc       laughter
mr  chairman
i realiz that when i finish my comment i was never realli clear about languag   after sort through all the comment that peopl have made and my thought about those comment  i am perfect happi with altern b as it is written and with the    on balanc    languag   i do want to say  though  that if we had replac the languag in section   with that about inflat pressur and uncertainti  the juxtaposit of the sentenc    inflat pressur seem like to moder over  e  but consider uncertainti surround that judgment    indic that the uncertainti relat to    moder over  e     and it   s clear that the uncertainti is about inflat be higher rather than lower   that statement would be somewhat more hawkish and  in fact  more reflect of where peopl   s balanc of concern was   i am total in agreement that there is no need to chang this languag right now  but i did want to weigh in a bit there
well  i  too  support altern b  and simpl logic   we haven   t arriv at the op  pictur yet   output growth is slow  inflat is still elev  and there is a fair amount of uncertainti   some of us focus on uncertainti in the inflat pictur  and some on both side   i think the situat merit a patient approach at this junctur  we should give it some more  e   regard the languag  not be well school in the literari style of the fomc  i  too  focus on the    on balanc    phrase  think that it inject mayb a hint of equivoc   i understand the logic   i believ what i heard presid   say is that we have to think in a two step process here   that is  if you put it in and then the next  e around take it out  how do the market react   so for what it   s worth  i focus on that  not quit know how to process the    on balanc    languag   otherwis  i   m go to abstain from the languag debat here until i have a littl more experi
i don   t know that it will help    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor altern b and think that there is a veri heavi presumpt against our chang the languag much from our march statement  from all that i   ve heard today  i don   t think we have even convinc ourselv that we have match that presumpt or overcom that burden of persuas   so though i   ve had some sympathi in isol to the  n suggest  i don   t think this is the right  e to take it up in light of our experi of the last statement   for sever day  we had the market focus on us rather than on the data   what you  mr  chairman  and other have done over the most recent period is to tri to get the market to be depend on the data rather than to look at us   these chang in languag   whether the  n amend or someth els at this point   do just the revers of that   i don   t think this is a good  e for nuanc in the market  and so i don   t think our substitut there would be good   i don   t think we can agre  even among ourselv  what the  n amend would do   whether it   s hawkish or dovish  and if we can   t  i hard think it   s a good prescript for us to send it out to the market and have them figur it out for us   laughter  so i strong favor altern b   i think the market will read the chang in section     where we say     econom growth slow in the first part of this year      as    we believ april as well was quit mediocr      i think that   s what it mean   that   s what we believ  and so that chang is justifi by the fact   in term of the    on balanc    languag in section    i could live either way  but i don   t see a compel reason for ad    on balanc      i think the market still want to see in us a reflect of what they believ   they believ that we   re cut  that our credibl on inflat is real  but that we   re just be a littl cute now   i wouldn   t want to give them an excus to say that we   ve taken our foot off the acceler  that we   re less concern about inflat   it is just one data point  so i   d prefer to leav it without    on balanc    as it was previous   that   s it   thank you
i think you mean the brake    laughter   anyway  thank you   governor
as everyon els has said  there haven   t been enough data to lead us to chang our view  and the polici should remain where it is   altern b is the right way to go  and   i agre with governor kohn   it is the best way to meet our dual object   the statement from last  e bought us some flexibl  although at some cost   it left a bit of confus in the market  which we   ve clarifi   it is import for us to maintain that flexibl  and so in alter the statement we should think about that   in the first part of section    we do have to acknowledg that growth slow in the first part of this year   it is import to make that chang   but becaus we have made that chang  the chairman   s suggest seem quit reason to me   rather than say    nevertheless     just assert that    recent indic suggest that the economi seem like to expand at a moder pace over come quarter      i think the chairman had suggest start that sentenc with    overal      if peopl like the phrase    on balanc     we can say    on balanc recent indic suggest that           laughter  depend on whether we choos to use the phrase    on balanc    in the next sentenc   on the next sentenc  i   m open about whether we use    on balanc     but i would  on balanc  go for take it out becaus i don   t see the particular benefit at this point of ad in that qualif   in some sens it take away a bit of our flexibl rather than ad to it   i   m tri to think about the most like scenario go forward  and it   s more like that we might want to remov or alter that phrase than keep it   so from our  e seri perspect go forward  it might leav us a littl more flexibl not to put it in  but i don   t have a veri strong view on that  as you can see from my comment  i think that we shouldn   t be chang thing much  in principl  i   m sympathet to gari   s propos  but this is not the right  e to make that chang   there is a question about the interpret of    high resourc util      if we take our central tendenc discuss  we   re go to see growth around   percent or so  clear below potenti   that  sn   t suggest a high level of resourc util   but given what the chairman mention about like chang in employ growth  by the  e we have our next meet we may be ad     or     percentag point to the unemploy rate  and so it would be     percentag point higher than we were quit recent  although it   s still broad at a relat low level   the chang would bring us back to a higher level than we   ve seen in quit a few month  we should just be mind of that   i   m not suggest that we take it out  but we will have to think about how to chang it becaus the high level of resourc util is not go to be there by tradit measur   but most of us think that there is still a lot of potenti to sustain those pressur  which may not just be the high level of resourc util   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   obvious  i support altern b   it seem from a polici perspect that our outlook hasn   t realli chang   we want to chang as littl as possibl in our statement   my sat score in english were much lower than my sat score in math  so i   m not go to comment on the issu of the phrase    on balanc       laughter   but let me return to the issu that vinc origin rais and that has come out from sever of the particip    perspect   i think we will soon be face a veri difficult situat   if the forecast come in along the line that we expect  which for us is a nice situat in which inflat come down to   percent in the core and look as though it will stay there   that it   s not just a temporari one shot deal and that it will go back up again   we   re go to face a veri difficult issu in term of the statement   unless i have a sens of the consensus on this committe for what is our ul  object for inflat  i   m go to have a real problem   my view of where the number should be is that i lean toward   percent becaus i do think the transit cost are import  although i am concern about the issu that presid   mention   we cannot be opportunist and just chang the number becaus  as i mention earlier  that creat actual a veri bad expect dynam  which has the opposit effect of an automat stabil in term of what happen to both inflat and output   if the committe decid that     is a better number  i could definit live with that   that would make it easier for me to deal with the statement becaus  if we   re at   percent and have not built a consensus on our ul  object for inflat  then i   m go to be oppos to say that inflat is elev  and that would be an issu   if the committe   build a consensus that we should be at a lower number than   percent  then i would be comfort with it   the reason i think this is import is that we   ll be forc into a discuss about this  the problem that will then aris is that  if we have a consensus insid it will not be transpar not to reveal that to the outsid   so the issu is that  whether or not we want to  we are go to be forc into a discuss about how we talk about our object on inflat  and we have to think veri hard about it   we may not be there now  but i actual hope we are becaus i want inflat to come down   it   s go to be on the tabl  and it   s go to be complic becaus we   ve had troubl build a consensus in the committe about this issu  but we need to be awar of the difficulti we will face   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   vice chairman
i think we   re in a fair good place in term of the polici and the signal   the languag in march and in altern b today preserv a nice balanc between the need to signal concern that we may not get as much moder in inflat as we   d like and acknowledg of some of the dispers of view around the committe on what our ul  object should be  what our prefer are  and over what period we   d like to see inflat come down to whatev level   it also give us more flexibl   i would not want to jeopard that balanc today   i don   t see ani compel need to alter market expect today  and as i said  i am quit comfort with altern b  just on the latter  deeper convers about where we   re go in june   thing will chang between now and june   june will be interest  i suspect  even if it unfold in the way the forecast impli   but ul  our judgment is about whether we have an accept forecast for inflat   it   s whether the path go forward is accept to us in some sens  and that   s what our discuss should be about   of cours  you can   t separ that from where inflat is today becaus that   s where you   re start   but as   and mani other have consist remind us  the languag is about the forward look effect of polici today  or as they are built into market expect  or as we assum today for the expect path of inflat go forward   but i like b and would be avers to chang it
thank you  and thank you for all the comment   on the action  i think we   re clear that we want to stay where we are   i just want to make the observ that for almost a year now we have taken a veri steadi approach  not onli in keep polici at a given level but in term of our rhetor and in term of our confid in moder growth and a slow moder of inflat   dure the period  the market and the general view have gone up and gone down  and we have maintain a pretti even keel   that increas confid in the institut  and unless we have a reason to chang our view  we should continu to stay on a steadi path  on the statement  let me start with section    which i recommend we not chang   the respons last  e was a littl noisier than i expect  although i did expect some respons   we tri to do a number of thing at onc   we want to retain a balanc of risk that emphas inflat risk  but we also want to get away from forward direct languag   we want to get away from what i think was an inaccur suggest that the next move was certain go to be up   in some circumst  for exampl  we can effect tighten by simpli stay where we are   we also want to convey that  given the uncertainti we were experienc  some more flexibl was need   so it was a veri complic chang to make   i   m not sure what els we could have done   in ani case  i think we have the market in sync with our view  and therefor i would be veri reluct to go through that again to chang the assess of risk   so i   m go to demonstr a veri conserv perspect today  which probabl won   t surpris you  on the rational  i think i   m okay with the second section as it stand   if you   d note the parallel to march  the first sentenc essenti indic that we recogn what was go on in the economi  nevertheless  we expect  base on longer term consider and on our think about the broad sweep of develop in the economi  moder growth go forward   this   the same thing   we acknowledg what   s go on   we saw slower growth  we see the hous sector   we   re not blind to current econom develop   nevertheless  we have good fundament reason to think that growth will be moder   i wouldn   t necessarili reject my own suggest to put in someth about recent indic  but put that in   creat a transitori kind of sens that we   re look onli at the last few number   i think it   s good to project the sens that we have a long view and that we are comfort with our long view and are stay with it  i   ve been tri to decid what to do about    on balanc      a coupl of thought   my inclin after i listen to the convers   and i would be happi to take a poll or whatev   is to strike it on the follow ground   we are move from a statement that said    recent read on core inflat    to one that say simpli    core inflat       the implic there seem to me to be that we   re not refer now to the last coupl of month but realli to a broader measur of core inflat   so  again  in a conserv spirit  to avoid ad more languag  i have a mild prefer for drop the phrase  but i   m open to comment on that  with respect to the ongo discuss about the implic of our languag for an inflat target  we are go to have to address that   in a moment i will ask governor kohn to talk a bit about communic   we will have a chanc in our next meet to talk about the statement   i hope that in talk about the statement we can address issu such as how much detail we should includ  how often we should chang  and how we should express the balanc of risk   obvious  we won   t be abl to nail all of this down  but we will have some opportun to tri to come to a broader view about what the statement   s role would be in our larger communic strategi   that   s anoth reason to be slight conserv at this point   but think ahead  presid  n   s suggest about the sentenc    inflat pressur seem like to moder over  e  but consider uncertainti surround that judgment    might be a place to go at some point   we might want to chang the deriv  and instead of talk about the level  we could say that we are still expect improv  but that there is a lot of uncertainti about it   that sort of shift it from level to direct   that might be a solut  if we come to a point at which we are at   percent or just below   percent   but i just rais that as a possibl  so in summari  my recommend is no action and altern b as written  strike the phrase    on balanc      are there ani comment in particular on the phrase    on balanc     presid
i   m against it

thank you   let   s just take a moment to updat the communic situat and hear  veri briefli  ani comment on the dri run   but let me turn it over to governor kohn for some comment
thank you  mr  chairman   i have just a few point  build on what you said a few minut ago   just to clarifi on the feder fund rate path   there was a consensus on the committe not to publish the fed fund rate path  so we are collect that just to understand what peopl   s polici assumpt are and how they fit into the forecast   there was a question of whether we should assum appropri polici or  as the chairman had suggest  whether we should assum what you think the committe would do rather than what it should do   i think we just need to think about what happen   we   ll have anoth dri run in june   i think i would collect those assumpt again in june   but when we go live  onc we decid how to focus this polici  we might or might not collect the fed fund rate assumpt   the problem with go live and collect the assumpt is that in five year they will be part of the public record   but as long as we   re do dri run  that   s not the presumpt   we   ll find out someth about how the committe think  and the committe can discuss how it want to character it assumpt  we can discuss our experi with this dri run now   howev  within the next coupl of day we will ask the staff to survey the committe about your reaction to how this went  how it could be improv  what aspect were most and least help  whether there are way to use this even more than we did in our polici discuss  and if there are thing   now that you   ve been through it onc   that you   d like to see from the staff that you didn   t get   what about the issu of circul our individu submiss   should the staff extract key issu from those submiss and circul a list of key issu ahead of  e   there are lot of thing on which we need to get your view befor we formul the june dri run   so you will have an opportun to make those comment in a formal way  as the chairman said  in june we will go on to some of the other communic aspect that we haven   t discuss befor  such as the  e of the minut  which will interact with this minut like descript that we   re do of the project  and when the descript need to be publish in  e for the chairman   s tes oni in juli and februari   there   s a possibl of move that up   then how will all of this interact with the statement  with the announc   if we go ahead with this forecast process  we   ll need to make sure that the statement conform to it  regard the statement  there are lot of question  as the chairman was say  about the balanc of risk and how we character thing   so i think we need to have a discuss of that in june  and it will be on the tabl in june
thank you   are there question for don or ani comment  presid
i understand the concern about the fed fund rate assumpt  how we interpret that  and what we ought to do   i have two suggest   one  i still believ that it ought to be part of the practic   i   ve express that view befor   two  at least for intern purpos  for this next dri run it would be help to get that inform on fund rate assumpt back in the write up so that  as we think about how this work  we will have those data to look at and to discuss at least in the context of what it look like and how it might shape what we   re do   i know that vinc gave us some indic of what peopl actual use when they submit it  i   d just make a suggest that in the next go round the inform be includ for intern purpos just to see how it shape our discuss
whi don   t we includ that in the survey and see whether peopl want to do it or not
i   d second be a littl more transpar within the committe about the fed fund rate   compar with other element of the sausag factori that get reveal in the transcript five year from now  i don   t see whi that should be so sensit   more broad  though  look at these chart  i was realli struck by the dispers of inflat forecast for        i would think we would be quit uncomfort releas that   the natur interpret of one   s forecast for inflat at that horizon is go to be what one   s object for inflat is  and this portray a committe that has not come to agreement on it object for the central thing that it   s respons for control   given that  i think that we want to come to closur on this issu befor we go live   inde  we   re do a dri run without have gone through that   i think the dri run after we go through that is arguabl go to be differ  and to my mind this argu for come to closur sooner rather than later
i just want to mention   i don   t know if this is true of other peopl   that i had two big problem when i was do this dri run   so though it will come out in the survey  i have a feel that other peopl might have view on this   one problem was that i realli had difficulti think about the confid interv becaus i didn   t feel that i had enough background from the staff about how to think about it   it   s not your fault becaus we didn   t ask you to do it   but here is my problem   i knew what the  book error were in term of the confid interv   i knew what the frb us confid interv were  and then there was an issu about how to think about them   i think there are thing we can say about that  for exampl  in the context of the frb us  we don   t assum ani model uncertainti   so the issu is that you think some more uncertainti might exist for the frb us error  but then  there are problem with the  book forecast error  which display greater uncertainti than the frb us error   so if we had a memo to realli think this through  it might provid a lot of background for us to think about how we do this   we might need to do that befor we go into the next dri run  so we can have some discuss about that  the other problem in figur out what to write down is the issu of appropri polici  which is central   again  as relat to the issu that we just discuss  i use an appropri polici of a   percent inflat goal becaus i think that   s one that i   m comfort with   it   s also consist with what i think reveal prefer has been on this committe in term of the polici action we   ve taken   howev  i would also be comfort if the committe built a consensus of     percent   then i would have had a differ view in my project becaus i would have felt that the polici in that case would be differ   so there is a question mark about how to think about that in the futur becaus it is the gray area that make this exercis more difficult   we do need to think about it   that   s what i struggl with when i sat down and ask     how am i actual go to do this
you know  we   re go to have to talk through a lot of substant issu on this   i thought  if we   re go to do it  let   s do it now   but you   ve all rais some of those question   i   m look at the clock   my suggest is this   i don   t know what we are plan for june   june is a two day meet  right
so i don   t think we can have these convers befor the next round   let   s make sure that we give ourselv  e in june and beyond so we can start to talk through this   so that those who didn   t speak today about their initi reaction aren   t left without the opportun to engag in this becaus there   s a whole rang of thing we could address  includ the three issu rais so far
i take vice chairman     s comment veri serious  but i want to rais just one thing becaus i would like it to get into the survey   we were offer one way of reflect uncertainti regard forecast   there might be other way   for exampl  altern scenario  qualit discuss of risk  or that sort of thing   that seem to some of us prefer   if you can phrase a question that would draw out of us other way in which we might like to character the risk around our forecast  i think that would be help becaus i  for one  find the rang of distribut of error kind of difficult
just a logist question  don   on the survey  i thought i heard you say that you were go to send it out in the next coupl of day
i would like to   i didn   t look at   when i said that    laughter   i mean  i think we ought to get feedback soon
the onli question i had is about the other iter we   re go to go through now  comment on the staff draft over the next two week   i think it would be good for us to go through that experi befor you send the survey out
good point   remind us when you can updat your project
through open of busi tomorrow
fine   so you have  i guess  the rest of the day to updat your project if you like    laughter   governor
i just want to underscor this point   it   s not at all clear to me that provid the median of the    percent confid band is go to be use to the market   i think that we have to think about what will be use to the market   it is import to convey some sens of the uncertainti   and i veri much look forward to the memo that   ask for  but academ never think in term of    percent confid interv  they think about    or    percent confid interv   i   m not sure who besid reader of the bluebook and the  book think in    percent confid interv   so think about altern way to convey someth use to the market about our sens of uncertainti  without give a fals sens of precis of     in      and     in       may be a better and more sensibl way to go   i think we look odd put someth like this out  and i   m not sure it would actual be help
i just want to say that this exercis is alreadi a success in term of the kind of question it   s make us confront   so i appreci that everyon is take this veri serious   we had veri good  detail respons from everyon  let me just close the meet with a few quick announc   first  the next meet is two day   june    and june      you will receiv addit inform about the nonpolici part of the discuss   second  as usual  on the night of june     we   ll have a dinner at the british embassi   a number of us have been concern about the late night  and so i had a discuss with the ambassador  and we   ve agre that there will be no program or speaker  the even will be strict social  and therefor mayb we   ll get out a littl earlier and have more  e to studi the  book    laughter   third  we circul a set of propos date for next year   s meet   if you haven   t respond to vinc or    pleas do so   there is lunch avail in the anteroom  and the meet is adjourn   thank you  end of meet
