good morn  everyon   we begin with
thank you mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag of chart with a peach cover    on the first page  as usual  is a chart depict the forward rate  you will note on the far right of each of the three panel that the recent spike in the current   month libor rate  the black line  occur as their matur move into the period that cover the calendar year end   i don t draw ani other signific to that spike   the red line on the top panel depict u s  forward rate  as you can see there  sinc the septemb  st releas of the august employ report  both the   month and   month forward   month rate have been driven below the current   month libor rate and the   month forward   month rate   more recent  the    and   month forward rate have trade down to within less than    basi point of the committe   s current fed fund target rate   summar differ    month rate in the second and third quarter of next year are now expect to be below current rate and below those in next year   s first quarter as well   it   s hard to resist the conclus that market are price in expect that the committe   s next move will be an eas   but there are veri few market particip who will say so in word  let alon date it  though they are actual predict it in their price behavior   so  while we see it in the price  it   s a funni kind of reflect of group behavior to which few are will to confess
someon will think of a phrase to describ it  like    money speak louder than word
yes  that come to mind   i think your former colleagu  wayn angel  well summar this curious state of affair  at least to my way of think   when recent ask what the committe   s next move would be  he respond that it would occur in the year         laughter   turn to the middl panel  as you can see  the euro forward rate declin a bit after the ecb rais rate on august   st but move down princip on septemb  st  as u s  rate fell after the releas of our employ report   they rose again a littl but then declin throughout septemb as evid seem to accumul that euro area growth was slow and may have hit a near term peak earlier in the summer   japanes forward rate  as the   line in the bottom panel indic  have becom a littl noisier as calendar and fiscal year end date    a copi of the chart use by mr    is append to this transcript    appendix      have trade into the forward rate matur  but the overal level are littl chang   on the next page i have shown some long term rate   the top panel show u s  treasuri yield on   year     year  and    year secur and the bottom panel has the u s  and euro swap rate for those same matur  in the top panel you can see that from august   st through last friday  the latest date depict there    year treasuri yield declin by about    basi point   those expect a slowdown in econom activ have eager cite this as evid support that outlook   both     and    year treasuri yield back up  with    year yield trade abov    year yield for the first  e sinc januari  and this has been eager cite by those who have been concern about inflat risk   now  i don   t want to downplay concern about inflat  which are wide be discuss in the market  particular with refer to the volatil in oil price   but the modest backup in yield on     and    year treasuri did appear to coincid with a heavi pace of new corpor issuanc and with indic from the campaign trail and the congress that both major polit parti might yet find a way to spend some of the surplus   moreov  in the top part of the bottom panel  you can see that swap rate show a slight differ and less pronounc trajectori   the   year swap rate  like the   year treasuri yield  fell by    basi point from august   st through last friday   but the    year swap rate fell   basi point while the    year swap rate was unchang   at the bottom of the page you can see that euro swap rate  at lower level  rough track the movement in u s      and    year swap  with the   year euro declin    basi point and the    year declin   basi point   but the    year euro swap back up by    basi point   thus  both the dollar and the euro    to    year swap curv steepen by    basi point from august   st through last friday   but on the dollar side  all of the widen occur by fall   year rate  while on the euro side it was divid between a fall in the   year rate and a rise in the    year rate   these relat movement in u s  and euro area swap curv not onli reflect but reinforc the percept that while growth in the unit state may be slow  with the risk of an uptick of inflat  perhap from oil price among other thing  that in europ is slow also   and the slowdown in europ is from lower level of growth  while the uptick in inflat could perhap be of a greater magnitud from the combin of rise oil price and the fall euro   turn to the next page and direct to exchang rate  you can see in the top panel the percent chang sinc may  st in the three major currenc pair   the bottom panel depict impli volatil of one month option   for those same pair   we should recogn  of cours  that the dollar has been strong against a number of currenc for some  e   but over the cours of the summer and into septemb  among the three major currenc i think we clear have a problem of a weak and volatil euro  particular against the yen   the red line show the euro yen rate lead the way lower in the top panel  as the spot rate has trade down  and the way higher in impli volatil in the bottom panel   the dollar yen line  in blue  is remark stabl across the top panel  with declin impli volatil in septemb   whi did the euro come under such pressur in septemb   i see three reason that work togeth   first  in anticip of the japanes fiscal half year end statement date on septemb   th  japanes investor were seek to reduc or hedg their euro exposur   second  in a market with this readi class of euro seller  there were some veri confus polici signal sent by the european   on septemb  th chancellor schroeder in a prepar speech said that the current euro dollar exchang rate is more of a reason to be happi than concern   the ensu cacophoni of offici utter drew attent to the lack of a clear voic on euro exchang rate polici and made the euro   s exchang rate an increas polit issu   the third factor was the ecb   s mistak  in my view  of announc on septemb   th that it would sell accumul interest on it foreign exchang reserv  amount to     billion euro  and that in the futur it would consist sell interest incom   i want to be clear that i don   t think that   s a mistak in principl  in principl that   s a fine thing for a central bank to do   but  e is everyth   i   m confid that the ecb thought that with this devic they could interven a littl without expos themselv to the credibl loss of an actual intervent   from my way of think  by take an insuffici amount of fund to make a differ in the market  they sent a mute and garbl signal of a    nonintervent    intervent   and they creat the risk of induc more euro seller to come into the market by announc their intent to buy   whi did we join the intervent on friday the   nd   the short answer is                                                                       virtual everi import condit that we spell out   at the start of that week                                                 was inform thursday even  while the  detail of the agreement were           wor be ked out  that secretari summer would state on friday after the oper that u s  foreign exchang polici remain unchang and that a strong dollar is in our nation interest   turn to the oper itself  you can see in the bottom portion of this last page various rate at certain select  e from wednesday septemb   th through last friday   i   d like to make three point about the joint intervent oper   sad  the oper appear  at least to my cynic eye  to have been anticip by some in the market   from wednesday   s close to thursday   s close  the euro rose more than a cent  and it rose anoth cent from thursday   s close to     a m  friday  just befor we enter the market   while it is often said that intervent work best when it   s push the market in the direct it alreadi want to go  this isn   t quit what we mean by that   second  even so  i think the oper should be recogn as have been fair success in a narrow technic sens   the rate close on friday the   nd at        higher than the prior day   s close and higher than the rate when we enter the market   at the close of the follow week  friday the   th  rate were higher than when we enter the market on the preced friday   we can have bigger movement than these  but i don   t think it   s reason to expect much more of intervent than a one day or one week impact  particular in the absenc of a subsequ concret polici action to which the intervent can be thought of as a bridg   third  i think the impact on expect about the committe   s futur action and u s  exchang rate polici was quit limit   dure the oper the dollar rose against the yen  as you can see in the exchang rate data on the bottom line of the page   while the decemb fed fund futur contract came off about       basi point on friday the   nd  most peopl in the market attribut this tini bit of nois to the weak in u s  equiti that day and the previous day rather than to the intervent   mr  chairman  for the first  e sinc      i will need a vote of the committe to ratifi the system   s foreign exchang oper   in those oper we sold             u s  dollar and purchas     million euro as the system   s share of the u s  portion of the septemb   nd intervent   in domest oper  the fed fund rate has been quit well behav sinc your last meet   we have redeem      billion in treasuri at auction under our intern limit and have purchas      billion in treasuri in outright oper sinc your last meet   i should note that the currenc compon of m  has been weaker than we had expect  this reflect both weaker domest demand and continu net inflow of foreign currenc from abroad   our detail extend forecast of reserv is avail on our market sourc web site   i will need a separ vote of the committe to ratifi our domest oper   i   d be happi to answer ani question
how much money did the american taxpay lose by our buy     million euro at a higher price than we would have had there not been front run
i haven   t made that calcul  but i   m sure we could do it in just a few minut  it could be done off of the rate i have provid here
it   s at least a coupl of percent
yes  it   s a coupl of percent
it   s about    to    million dollar
dino gave you the answer  it   s about    to    million dollar
we should complain and ask for restitut   my second question relat to the exhibit on swap rate and other yield   you indic with regard to the rather signific close of the spread in    year swap versus treasuri that the calendar was a factor  but if the privat calendar were an element in that  we would have seen more than a modest rise in the swap rate   the presumpt that there is no credit improv involv almost lead one to conclud that what we   re look at is the potenti demis of the    year treasuri issu   the probabl of that demis has gone down quit signific for the reason you suggest  about everyon in the polit arena want to spend part of the surplus   i agre to half that phrase   the polit campaign has week to go and the presumpt that there will be ani surplus left is question   whi can   t we say that virtual all of that close in the spread is attribut to the expect of run out of u s  treasuri secur   it   s a suppli problem  but the problem obvious is the issu of a greater potenti suppli of u s  treasuri rather than the privat calendar   would that be an accur way of look at it
i don   t disagre with the way you   ve describ it  mr  chairman   but it   s a veri small data sampl of onli a few week   and i think in the microcosm of a coupl of week  the heavi pace of privat corpor offer help to move those rate up to their peak   a number of investor look at the pickup in yield from a move out of a    year treasuri into a   year privat debt issu  and that opportun cost look veri attract to them   i   m not disagre with you that when we look back  whatev the trend line is here  probabl the suppli consider will be   more signific  but in this microcosm i offer both develop as factor in the bit of nois we were see here
i   m just rais the point that one certain can explain the firm of a    year swap rate in those term   but the presumpt that the fair signific declin in the spread is attribut to anyth other than the potenti long term suppli of    year treasuri i find somewhat less convinc   am i wrong in that
i would agre with you on where to put the most weight   but i would want you not to put zero weight on this differ issu  and mayb i should have been more explicit about it  that there will be a process of investor come out of the long end of the treasuri market at lower and lower yield   even if the suppli of treasuri come back from the dire forecast peopl have made of no    year issu outstand  these yield level relat to what is avail elsewher suggest that investor will be drawn to the higher yield instrument   i just urg you not to put a zero weight on that
no  i had no intent of do that   i never put zero weight on anyth    laughter
or     percent
or       further question for     presid parri
my recollect of previous intervent  let   s say go back    or    year  is that we would be approach by the treasuri which  of cours  was receiv a lot of pressur from anoth countri  and we would act at the request of the treasuri   it sound as if the dynam were a littl differ this  e becaus you emphas your discuss with the ecb and discuss with the chairman   did you just leav out a part or was it differ
i don   t think it was qualit differ from oper of the earli     s in the sens that there usual have been two channel of communic with the unit state   in those day  it was between the bundesbank and both the feder reserv and the treasuri   those two channel oper concurr   the treasuri was and remain in the driver   s seat  as we say
and that was the case this  e
that was the case this  e
that wasn   t clear to me   thank you
i   m sorri  i meant that to be explicit   there is a novel awkward with the ecb in that  as secretari summer has said  there is no one to answer his phone call  there is no one place where he can call his counterpart  wherea there is someon to answer our phone call   so there was some awkward   and there   s still an intramur disput on the contin as to who   s on first in that regard   this made the process consider more awkward and cumbersom for both the unit state treasuri and for us
you know the treasuri  to it credit  feel uncomfort deal direct with anoth central bank except through us   and i think in that regard
so there   s an institut chang that has realli produc the differ approach
it   s larg that
it   s an institut differ
the feder reserv repres both itself and the treasuri of the unit state wherea the ecb   not repres the treasuri of it member countri but is just the central bank
good   i think that explain it
i   m sorri i wasn   t clear about that
mr  chairman  i   d like to take a coupl of minut to talk about the intervent issu becaus i think it   s a veri import issu for us   if i were current a vote member of the fomc  i would offer an amend to the motion to ratifi the recent transact in euro for system account   my purpos would not in ani way be to express concern over the action of the account manag  but to reduc the probabl of futur intervent for system account  the amend  and i don   t have exact word  would requir that ani futur intervent be made in the context of the committe   s discuss at it most recent meet and that the chairman should  if feasibl  consult with the fomc befor author addit transact in foreign currenc   i take this posit becaus i believ that the recent exchang market intervent is a veri serious issu for the feder reserv   the intervent has not to date creat problem  but it probabl will in the futur   go down this road is like to be cost to the unit state  the decis to particip in the european effort to support the euro was made by the u s  treasuri and not by the feder reserv   howev  we have lent our prestig and bless to the intervent by particip  not just as an agent for the treasuri  but for our own account  moreov  the intervent was wide report as an intervent by the central bank involv   i believ that the intervent was unwis and did not serv the interest of the unit state  nor of europ for that matter   but our respons is to the unit state and we ought to make the best judgment we can in that regard   if the u s  treasuri has a differ judgment  then it should    interven for it account   we can act as agent for the treasuri  but i believ we have an oblig not to interven for the feder reserv account if in our judgment the intervent is unwis  the problem with intervent in the foreign exchang market is that a dynam is creat that almost invari has caus difficulti in the past   i believ that we face a high probabl of the same process occur in this case   economist are agre that  il intervent is unlik to have ani long term effect   if there is a problem with polici fundament  then those fundament must be chang to achiev ani last chang in the valu of a currenc in the foreign exchang market  base on extens studi and experi with exchang market intervent  economist have develop an overwhelm consensus that an exchang rate system should be either freeli float or thorough fix through a currenc union or a currenc board   the halfway hous of intervent is unstabl and unsatisfactori   i know of no document case in which an intervent episod from the begin of a seri of intervent to the end turn out well   i know of lot of case that turn out bad   i   ve studi in consider detail the intervent dynam that began with the plaza agreement in septemb      and last for sever year  the conclus from that analysi is that the plaza intervent and it aftermath were cost for the unit state and for japan and the unit kingdom as well   intervent dure the     s and the earli     s that attempt to maintain the european exchang rate mechan did not work well   i could multipli these exampl mani  e over  intervent creat a polit and econom dynam that with high probabl creat further problem   the dynam ahead of us is that further instabl is like  whether the euro sink again or recov   if the euro sink  call for addit intervent are inevit   and the european central bank  have start down this road  will find it veri difficult not to continu     should the euro rise signific  there will be call to interven in the other direct befor an excess strong euro damag european export and the european econom recoveri   in either case  we   ll be ask to particip in these intervent   onli if we are lucki and the euro settl in the neighborhood of it current level for mani month do we have a chanc that the dynam of intervent will gradual fade  make further intervent unlik  feder reserv polici should not depend on our be lucki   if euro fluctuat lead to a european judgment for addit intervent  so be it   but the feder reserv should  in my view  make clear that this central bank   not believ that intervent for the feder reserv account is wise and that  therefor  we do not intend to join in ani futur intervent oper  we can make that point clear to our european friend and to the u s  treasuri without advertis our posit public  i do not accept the argument that the unit state  includ the feder reserv  is simpli passiv support our friend in europ   the unit state and europ are now in the intervent busi togeth   i believ it imper that the feder reserv lead in reestablish a u s  polici of nonintervent in the foreign exchang market  the feder reserv is in a veri difficult posit on this matter   if the feder reserv rather than the treasuri had the legal respons to make these decis for the unit state  then i do not believ that the fomc would have been out front urg intervent   this committe might or might not have cooper when the ecb ask us to interven for the feder reserv account   i hope the committe   s respons would have been a polit    no      but now we have lent our prestig and accept a degre of the respons for the outcom of this process that has start  while defer to the treasuri on the decis to support the ecb   s intervent decis   if this committe is oppos to the intervent on it merit  as i believ it should be  then we need to find    a way to extract ourselv from support intervent with our prestig and our resourc   we should not permit ourselv to be in a posit where we are account but have cede author over the intervent decis to the treasuri   that is whi i believ that the feder reserv should make clear to the treasuri that the system will not share in ani futur intervent without the express author of this committe
let me comment   first of all  you left out in your analysi of  il intervent the most extraordinari set of experi prove it  sn   t work  which is the japanes experi employ     billion against the dollar with zero effect   there is no evid  nor   anybodi here believ that there is ani evid  to confirm that  il intervent   anyth   we don   t believ it   the treasuri  sn   t believ it   the european do  but that   s anoth question  when is the last  e we interven
between june of      and today  or i should say last week  we probabl had    or so differ request  at various level  for intervent   we turn them all down   and inde  in this latest case we were not happi with the notion of interven  what occur essenti was that the treasuri  feel under veri consider pressur from the rest of the g    conclud that in the spirit of intern comiti we had veri littl choic but to accommod the european                                       we  the feder reserv  did have the choic of say we would not particip   the presumpt that we could do that without it be known is not believ   we publish data on our intervent activ and if we don   t particip with the treasuri  it becom known   now  that would creat a schism within the unit state govern  and the question we have to evalu is whether our concern about the inefficaci and potenti    counterproduct effect of  il intervent are far more signific than the schism that would be creat with the treasuri   in my judgment the answer is no  for the same reason that we acquiesc in an aw lot of crazi econom that go on out there  not onli in the intern realm among our trade partner  but within the rest of the u s  govern   we do have to maintain a relationship with them   we are independ  to be sure  but not from the congress   inde we are not   so i think we have a veri serious difficulti in make these tradeoff  i told                                 when we were talk about it in advanc  that the thing we have to be concern about is the probabl that this intervent will fail   and a failur of the intervent as we go into the g   meet would put extraordinari polit pressur on everybodi to say someth   i said to him  if this fail  will you support a statement that say that europ must address the fundament  which inde are the caus of the weak in the euro   and he said absolut yes   i can   t second guess the treasuri on this  they have been veri good over the last number of year and would probabl not disagre with a word you said with respect to the evalu of intervent   i think what we have to do is to make judgment as to how import certain issu are   i don   t deni that this is an import issu   but i just do not think  at the level at which we are interven and the infrequ with which we are do it  that it creat an ongo problem for us   is it a negat   i agre with you that it is   is it a signific negat   i don   t think so   would i have prefer that we didn   t interven   i certain would   would we be strong oppos to anoth intervent   we told them we would be   they want to creat some ongo possibl of intervent over a period of day  and we said absolut not in term of make ani commit   we did not shut the door complet   we said that in all case intervent is a batch process   we do them one at a  e but in the context of the condit in each individu case   and i would say that so far this treasuri has been a lot less like to cave in to foreign pressur than    previous one   and in view of that i believ they deserv our support even though we do it with  i think  some signific chagrin   that   s my view  anyway
may i comment
i   ve been at the reserv feder for      year  have had     s job and now the vice chairmanship of the committe  and i think econom theori is wonder and is extrem help in guid us in our judgment   but in my  e here  i have found that veri occasion one reach the point  as the chairman has just been suggest  that we as central banker have to make practic decis  know that they are not consist with the soundest possibl econom theori   this was one of those occas   given that this was our first intervent sinc      and one of the veri few that we have done over the cours of mani year  i think the member of this committe should have the confid that the chairman make these decis veri rare  and in my view veri wise   he is help a great deal by the new york desk   i usual am activ involv and i am the person who is frequent call first becaus they know i usual say    no      and for some reason they have decid that a    no    from me is less appal than a    no    from the chairman   we are constant tell other   that intervent basic accomplish noth   but there are veri rare occas  and i think this was one of them  when the overal respons for the manag of the world economi  which is someth in which we are the major player but not the onli player  requir us to respond favor to a request for intervent   but we do so on veri arduous term from the point of view of the request   this latest case involv a request that we in fact have been activ turn down for month   but the situat had reach a point    and in my    judgment  the monetari author of the unit state veri reluct made the right decis to join in the intervent  when we are deal with these situat we realli don   t want to be in the posit of requir a committe meet to say no becaus we say no      percent of the  e   it would be extrem awkward for us to say  when we are in the middl of these roll negoti  that we have to tune out for x hour in order to have an fomc meet   with the track record of the chairman and the amount of confid that we have in him  i think have the chairman make the decis on use of the system   s money is appropri   as a matter of fact  if the amount involv get to a certain level  the committe   s stand procedur instruct provid that the chairman shall clear the propos intervent with the foreign currenc subcommitte  which current consist of the chairman  governor    governor    and me   we are     percent in agreement with you on the theori  but pragmat consider veri  veri occasion guid us to a differ conclus
mr  chairman  if i may   what i think we need is a stand posit that we do not share       with the treasuri in ani intervent unless there is an explicit decis to do so   it is veri awkward to say no when we have a custom of share         i understand that   it is that custom that i would like to see us chang   and i think we have a context today that show whi we need to chang that stand posit
frank  i serious question whether it is worth fundament alter our relationship with the treasuri over what is effect a veri minor chang   rememb that our money is realli their money   if there is such a thing as a sharehold of the feder reserv  it is the u s  treasuri   to the extent that we profit or lose in our foreign exchang oper  it net out against our payment to the treasuri each year   in that sens it   s    alway their money with which we are trade   whether we are split the intervent amount       or        the net effect on treasuri budget receipt  so to speak  is invari   so it is an act that essenti involv nonsubstant account   i don   t see what we avail do that   i think we do far better go out period as we do  we all do  say that intervent  sn   t work  we   ve all said that public and i think that   s far more relev than our go through the motion of not particip in the transact  of not do    percent   i think that creat more problem than it solv
i have a coupl of question  but first i want to say that i think we have a good chanc of make a profit on this one  go back to the chairman   s earlier question about how much did the taxpay lose by our buy euro at the price we bought them  i assum that was in contrast to the price at which we could have bought them   what exact are the mechan of determin the price
if i understand your question  it   s the price we get when we enter the market   we call our counterparti and they quot a price at which we may buy   the chairman   s question had to do with the set of number across the bottom of page   in my materi   had the rate not trade up   cent  how much would
the presumpt be there was front run
the oper was front run or leak  or at least there are all sort of question
we are not just talk about the market go up   we   re say that a decis was made on thursday  at what  e
i   m an innoc  so you may have to explain this in more detail to me  you are say that
i want to be clear that i don   t think
littl countri on the peripheri of the exchang rate system of our world economi can have activ reserv manag   i don   t think it work for a major currenc or even a compon of it in an ncb to have an aggress reserv manag program   for your benefit  we at the feder reserv  as i   m sure you pretti much take for grant  do not adjust the currenc composit of our foreign currenc reserv other than through offici act of intervent   it   s routin for other central bank around the world to trade activ for profit in the exchang market and to hedg their reserv posit activ and dynam   malaysia come to mind in it oper a number of year ago   when it   s a small countri whose currenc  sn   t play a particular dramat role in the world economi  i think everyon know how to deal with that   when it   s a compon of an institut that is one of the major central bank of the world  it realli is veri differ   the bank of england  i want to be veri clear  has a long tradit of be an activ foreign currenc trader in the open market   they   ve had some good and some bad experi with that  and they   ve develop a centuri long tradit that lend a note of distinct    to that kind of trade oper   i think that   s the except that prove the rule rather than a good pattern for other to follow
anoth question is on the definit of  il   how do we know this intervent is  il on their part   i take it the definit of un il intervent in this case would be that fewer euro and more dollar are creat in the near futur than would otherwis have been creat   on our side  we are go to do what we are go to do without take that intervent into consider  but do we know that our counterpart at the ecb aren   t go to take some action that would keep the intervent from be entir  il
well  we don   t know what they will decid at their council meet later this week with respect to their interest rate   but just as we target an interest rate  they target an interest rate   so i   ve taken it for grant  and i think the market has too  that they will be manag their repo oper just as we would   and i believ there was some reflect of that in the market there
it is conceiv that their target for the interest rate will be differ than it would have been had they not interven  isn   t it
that will onli come out of their council meet  just as it would onli come from this committe
i understand that  but
it   s possibl
i   m say that we   re all talk as if this has been  il
i think you   re rais a slight differ issu   the degre of open market oper requir to keep an interest rate constant  and henc the creation of  in our case dollar and in their case euro  can vari   so it is not the same thing as say that if the interest    rate target is unchang  the result is full  il in the sens that the actual open market oper offset the foreign exchang oper euro for euro   as a practic matter it is veri close  but it  sn   t have to be exact becaus they don   t endeavor to do a full  il in the sens that the asset side of their balanc sheet is liter unchang and they mere shift from one currenc to the other   they don   t do that   what they do is to target an interest rate   basic the net effect of that is almost exact as if they were to offset the exchang rate transact euro for euro   but it is not exact that type of full  il   nor   anybodi do it that way   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  for all of my strident opposit to intervent over the year  i recogn that in particular case such as this one tough call have to be made   and we are in a difficult situat   but i certain want to support the thrust of bill pool   s statement   for me the problem has alway been the damag that intervent and the prospect of intervent can do to the overal credibl of our longer term price stabil object   to me that   s the key problem   so i would support bill and in particular his suggest that at some point we consid tri to find a way in advanc to commit ourselv to disengag from this activ    while intervent may seem not to do great damag in a particular instanc like this if it involv a relat small amount of transact  it still put the possibl on the tabl  it   s alway out there  so i realli believ we need to tri to find some institut way to get around it perman
i think we are do that   we are do it  hope  by educ   i   ve had innumer convers with our counterpart in the central bank of japan and europ argu the inefficaci of this kind of oper   a lot of us have   i know bill   has done that and so have a lot of other   and it has work in part   i believ there has been a veri major chang in the general view about the efficaci of intervent among the central    banker   the problem is that financ minist chang with some frequenc   we convinc one and then he leav offic   and his replac start tabula rasa   and it is by no mean self evid that a currenc cannot be stop from move mere by interven   there are lot of economist who believ that   i won   t go through a list of our friend who do  but there are some fair promin economist out there who serious believ that we can effect implement  il intervent and make it work   if one can   t convinc them  then it   s pretti tough to convinc a polit person whose background is somewhat margin in this area   but frank  educ is the best way that i know of to solv this problem  in other word to get less interest in intervent as a possibl solut   and i would say that we   ve succeed to a veri larg extent with the g    governor   we have just not done all that well with the rotat g   or g    financ minist
may i just make a quick follow up comment   to me it   s not the question of inefficaci or whether  il intervent   or   not have an impact of some sort over the short run   it   s a matter of our credibl and what it   to that
suppos intervent work and we use it   what would that do to our credibl
well  i think it rais question about what our ul  fundament object is
absolut  but it has noth to do with our credibl   it may say that our polici posit are conceptu inaccur or inappropri
i mean the credibl of a long run strategi aim fundament at longer term price stabil
but suppos peopl could argu that  il intervent actual enhanc an anti inflationari postur   if that were factual so  we would affect our credibl by not interven   it   s a factual issu  i don   t think it   s a credibl issu
let me return more to presid pool   s argument  and perhap make a less subtl comment than the chairman just made   if you realli want us out market the view that intervent is a terribl idea  we can do it much more effect with our present relationship with the treasuri than we can without it   the amount of influenc that we have in intern circl is enhanc by the role we play   so it isn   t just alan  span  bill    and other around the tabl give our pet idea on some theori  but rather that we also have power  and    clout    in the languag of my nativ citi  and that   s veri import for us   so in my view we are carri your gospel more effect with the present arrang than we would without it   i   m absolut convinc of that
ani further comment   if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the foreign exchang activ of the desk
i   ll move to ratifi the foreign exchang activ of the desk
is there a second
object   thank you   they are approv  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the domest oper
without object  they are approv  befor we move on to the econom discuss  let me just say that this issu of intervent will reemerg period and i think this was a veri use discuss    i believ the    notion that you rais is an import one and was well worth discuss   but if ani of you have signific thought on this issu  a memorandum to either   or don or   would be use to give us a fuller view of where the committe is in this regard   let   s turn now to dave   and    son
on the whole  the data we have receiv over the past six week have not materi chang our view that the economi is eas onto a path of below trend growth   inde  we have made relat few chang to either our trajectori for overal real gdp or to the under compon of demand   with respect to inflat  the figur have contain few surpris asid from the further strengthen of oil price   perhap the most convinc evid of a cool in activ can be found in labor market   month gain in privat payrol  which had averag near         in the twelv month preced march  have drop off to an averag of about         per month sinc then   moreov  the workweek has slip a bit sinc the spring and aggreg hour work have been about flat   in that regard  it is strike that the entir   percent gain in real gdp that we have project for the third quarter is expect to come from increas product    the growth of manufactur activ also appear to have ratchet down from the rapid pace of late last year and earli this year   for the most part  the sign of slow appear to reflect the identifi macroeconom influenc that might be expect to follow a tighten of monetari polici   auto product is be trim in respons to some settl back of retail demand  the product of construct suppli has weaken percept  and some materi product  most notabl steel  has taken a hit from soften domest demand and heighten import competit   product in the high tech sector continu to advanc brisk  but there   appear to have been some moder here as well after the stun gain we saw earlier this year   spend for high tech equip also appear to have slow some in the third quarter  especi for communic equip   coupl with the hit that mani high tech compani have taken in the equiti market of late  some report of slow demand have rais concern about whether this is an area pois for some retrench   to be sure  there are risk here  but we do not yet see the case for abandon our relat upbeat outlook   in our forecast  high tech invest particip in the moder of invest demand that we expect to accompani the downshift in the pace of final sale   but with the relat price of this equip still declin at a steadi clip  the backlog of unfil order high  and consider unexploit opportun appar avail  we continu to expect high tech invest spend to expand quit rapid   other capit spend also has slow of late  and we are project    the growth in these outlay to remain more subdu go forward owe to the slower pace of busi sale and the less favor financ environ that we are expect over the next two year   in addit to somewhat less ebulli busi outlay  our project depend import on a sustain slowdown in household spend   here  the recent data certain could give one paus about our stori   over the past two month  activ in hous market has experienc a bit of a resurg   no doubt  the drop in mortgag rate has provid a lift to construct  more so than we had anticip   but  even with the recent upturn in start  residenti invest is like to post a sizabl negat for the third quarter   i should note that new singl famili home sale  releas this morn  were revis down about       percent in juli  and they drop   percent in august   the consum spend figur also have pick up notic of late  but we had larg anticip this bounc back from the sub par second quarter gain   moreov  with the except of that small second quarter increas  our project growth of       percent in real pce in the third quarter would be the slowest in a year and a half   look ahead  with mortgag rate still up near    basi point from the middl of last year  with incom gain have moder consider  and with the stock market have move sideway this year  we believ that there are solid underpin to our forecast that household spend is like to remain more subdu for the remaind of the year   a continu of below trend growth in gdp seem the most like outcom as we move into        the lag effect of your previous tighten should still be play out over the next year or so   by       those effect begin to wane  and along with a bit more s ul discretionari fiscal polici  more rapid growth of export  and our project acceler in structur product  there is a more notic quicken in the pace of real gdp growth   that pickup is larg held in check by the further increas in the fund rate that we have assum for late next year and earli        with the growth of gdp continu to run below that of potenti output over the forecast interv  we expect to see the unemploy rate rise to       percent by the end of        although the increas in the jobless rate and our project gradual declin in oil price reliev some pressur on busi cost and price  we expect core inflat to extend the updrift that has occur over the past year or so   as you know  that veri modest deterior in our outlook for inflat balanc what we view as two key influenc about which there are consider uncertainti   the tight of resourc util and the pace of structur product growth      in recognit of those uncertainti  we gave a bit more emphasi in the  book to the longer term forecast than is customari for us when ad a year to the project   i trust that you will not confus that greater emphasi on the longer term with ani greater convict on our part about our abilitiy to predict how the economi will evolv two year henc   but we thought it might be use to illustr just how sensit our forecast is to our assumpt as we extend our project into        i won   t go into the detail of the myriad simul we includ  but i thought two scenario are worth special note   first  what if chang in the structur of our labor and product market have made it possibl for the economi to sustain in equilibrium a   percent rate of unemploy  or at least allow us to sustain it to the end of        in our simul of a   percent nairu  core price inflat slow gradual  rather than increas gradual as in the baselin   under these circumst  the need for ani further tighten is clear elimin  and some eas might be call for   on the surfac  this scenario seem consist with what might be built into current financi market expect   the second simul i want to mention is the one that examin the sensit of our outlook to the continu acceler we are forecast for structur product  from a pace of       percent in      to       percent in        we contrast our forecast to one in which the pace of structur product has improv  but onli to about   percent  where it remain over the next two year   this latter assumpt appear to be closer to the consensus forecast of outsid economist   if that consensus turn out to be closer to the mark  the simul we present suggest that the perform of the economi will not be near as rosi as we are expect   the growth of real output will be slower  the unemploy rate will be higher  and inflat will be increas notic   for the reason discuss in the  book  we are comfort with the choic we have made about these key element in the forecast  but there certain is consider scope for reason men and women to come to differ conclus   one final import risk in the outlook worth mention relat to develop in world oil market   in this forecast  we have yet again rais our project path of crude oil price   this has result in slight higher headlin inflat figur  especi in the second half of this year   those higher price depress dispos incom a bit  and tend to weaken our project for consum spend   in put togeth this forecast  we ask ourselv whether our inher    incrementalist    approach could be lead us to miss the bigger pictur   the cumul revis in our oil price forecast sinc januari has been about    per    barrel this year and has been about    per barrel in        could the total effect of a shift in price of this magnitud be larger than the sum of the smaller chang we have made to the forecast   with one except that i will mention short  we answer no to this question  at least for now   but there are reason to be concern   on the spend side  we have assum that household have respond to the negat real incom effect of higher energi price both by reduc spend and by dip into save   consequ  to the extent that household have view the runup as part transitori  the spend effect have like been mute   but if at some point there is a more pronounc reevalu of the like perman to the rise in oil price  there is a risk of a more abrupt downshift in consum spend   in financi market  small chang in oil price produc some winner and loser  but probabl don   t have signific net effect   by contrast  larg and volatil chang in oil price could add appreci to uncertainti about the outlook and result in some pull back from the market  with consequ for valuat and  ul   spend   there are risk  as well  on the inflat side   firm may have absorb some of the higher energi price in profit margin  in the hope that these price would soon reced to earlier level   at some point  busi may be forc to throw in the towel and rais price more aggress   worker  too  may have absorb the direct effect of higher energi price in lower real wage   but a higher and more persist level of price could eventu encourag attempt to restor some of the lost real wage through higher nomin wage demand   to date  we think all of these factor have been at work in small way  but not in the more abrupt  self reinforc  and nonlinear manner that could pose more signific risk to the outlook   consum confid has remain high  equiti market have not soften appreci  and inflat expect appear to be well contain   but we will be watch these develop close in come week   the one area where we made a discret chang was product   the rise in oil price has now been larg enough and is expect to persist long enough that we think there could be some minor advers effect on multifactor product   the need to econom on energi input in product and the effect on the profit of the exist capit stock of the higher relat price of energi have led us to chip a bit off the growth of multifactor product over the next coupl of year   nevertheless  the chang is not larg enough to prevent some further acceler in structur product     will now discuss how some of these risk could play out in the rest of the world
as dave note  the extens of our forecast through      provid an opportun to consid some longer term issu and risk   in particular  the longer forecast horizon allow the implic of our project for foreign activ  the exchang valu of the dollar  and  import  global oil price to be clear evid in the outcom for real export and import  the basic pictur we have present for the rest of the world remain one of robust growth with inflat that is larg contain   as alway  a few spot on the globe merit some concern on our part   argentina has yet to achiev sustain recoveri from the recent crisi despit the rebound in growth in it latin trade partner   some asian economi  for exampl the philippin and indonesia  still are struggl with the econom implic of what are fundament social and polit problem   and the pictur remain somewhat mix among the transit economi of ea n europ  nonetheless  to the extent we can discern such thing  the risk in these countri appear to be countri specif and not like to trigger broader crise and contagion should troubl erupt   in put togeth the baselin forecast for the foreign outlook  we too grappl with the issu of how best to frame the question rais by the recent shift up in spot and futur oil price   we continu with our practic of reli heavili on these market price in specifi the path for global oil price that is incorpor in the outlook  the view implicit in the futur curv that oil price are like to come down over the near term as some element in demand eas off and suppli remain steadi seem reason   but the higher level for the entir path relat to that in the august  book reflect our agreement with market sen ent of greater uncertainti about the balanc of global suppli and demand over the forecast period than seem to be the case six week ago  nevertheless  we recogn that there are circumst that could caus oil price to fall more rapid than we have now in the forecast as well as other that could generat further upward pressur in the short term   in the baselin  book forecast  the implic for foreign real econom activ of the more elev path for oil price vari  depend on whether a countri is a net export or import  and are general quit small  a small impact is consist with the substanti reduct in the energi intens of real output in near everi major countri over the past thirti year   in addit  we see the current upward pressur on oil price result to a signific extent from the strength of global demand   global oil product is now abov the level reach befor opec implement suppli restraint in the spring of        howev  that suppli has not been suffici to keep price from rise in the face of the increas demand   under these circumst  we do not anticip that the elev energi price will have the negat effect on busi and consum confid that character previous oil crise      with oil inventori appar low and suppli disrupt still a possibl  we includ in the  book an altern scenario for oil price  the particular path that we simul is that of the price of oil rise to     per barrel and remain there over the entir forecast period   this altern is not the most like path for price in the event of a suppli disrupt   but it   have the properti that the oil price is high enough for long enough that our model would show notic effect on real activ from the direct impact of higher energi cost   for the unit state  the assumpt use in the model about the respons of monetari polici determin whether the impact of higher oil price are almost entir on price  the outcom when the fed fund rate is kept at the  book baselin  or almost entir on output  the outcom when monetari polici is tighten in respons to the increas in oil price   clear  intermedi outcom with some effect on both inflat and output are possibl for monetari polici choic that are between these two   for the rest of the world  our model suggest that the impact of this higher oil price path is notic  but not sever   the particular impact vari from countri to countri  depend on it oil product status and on the strength of link to the u s  economi and the u s  monetari polici respons   secondari effect are transmit across countri through relat exchang rate chang that in turn depend upon the monetari polici respons to higher oil price  our model result suggest that over the next two year the impact on weight averag foreign gdp growth could rang from negat     to     percentag point   the effect on u s  real export and import depend on the particular u s  monetari polici assumpt  but on balanc u s  real export are boost becaus of the relat larg share of u s  export to the oil export countri such as mexico  canada  the unit kingdom and opec   in nomin term  the higher cost of u s  oil import swamp effect on our export and non oil import  accord  the u s  nomin trade deficit and current account deficit widen signific in respons to the sustain higher oil price   as in the  book  we did not put into this simul addit influenc on privat invest or consumpt that might aris from confid factor   such effect clear could generat a more negat outcom than this model simul suggest   but ani judgment on our part of how larg to make these negat effect under current circumst would be total arbitrari   on balanc  we are left with the conclus that the effect of higher oil price per se are not like to threaten our quit posit outlook for the global economi   more negat outcom are possibl  but they depend import on where the shock aris and how it is transmit into the global economi   as a footnot  i would like to report on the japanes tankan survey for the third quarter that was releas overnight  that survey show a bit more posit chang than the market or we were expect   most of the posit    news relat to respons from larg manufactur  small manufactur and non manufactur continu to lag somewhat behind   we continu to be skeptic about the strength of the recoveri in japan and look for real gdp growth there to remain posit over the next two year  but at annual rate of growth in the   to       percent rang   we   ll be happi to answer your question
are there ani use data support the general notion of a modest slowdown in the rate of flow of capit from europ to the unit state   what do we know about that   i ask becaus i keep see a number mention which i don   t quit see in the balanc of payment data
i don   t see that in the balanc of payment data either   we   ll get q  data with some lag and then we   ll get the foreign direct invest number   it   s not until we actual have the balanc of payment data for the quarter that we get the fdi
we do have portfolio data
we have portfolio number   i think there are hint in that but i wouldn   t say there   s anyth convinc one way or the other   but the european  who on their side may have more data by countri that aren   t yet publish  say this to me
it take a long  e for it to go from there to here
if there is a slowdown  it   s not dramat yet  that   s for sure   but the european seem to be of the view that there has been  and it may just be that they   re count the number associ with the merger and acquisit that are go through becaus in some sens that is what has trigger some of the most visibl flow   but that   s a veri volatil seri and it   s hard to see whether a trend has realli emerg in it
other question for   or
i have two distinct question  which are complet separ   the recent earn warn that have come out of appl and intel  and i believ xerox and mayb some other  have refer specif to septemb sale as be consider weaker than anticip  is there someth there that those compani are see that we   re not see   or do you think  have made more buoyant forecast earlier  that this is in part a way of cover themselv with the analyst   that   s one question for you  second  i want to congratul the staff on it care work on energi   i think that was veri help   at least on my read of that work  this is much more than an oil price shock   what we have is a worldwid demand shock at work here and there   s a normal lag in tri to adjust product for chang in demand   also  there was some confus over the inventori of stock that has been built and that kind of thing   but i think a major part of this stori is a worldwid demand shock   i believ that is veri import to emphas becaus the general discuss of this in the press  includ some of the comment economist have been make about it  i find almost embarrass   but i do have a question becaus i understand that a lot of the problem now is with refin capac   so  even if we get the crude oil  we may have troubl get the finish product  i understand that refineri in the unit state are go flat out   what do we know about refineri elsewher in the world and how close to capac they are oper   and do we know anyth about the amount of new capac that   s come on stream or how long it take to add capac in refin
well  i   ll start with the first question on the technolog sector   we have not heard uniform the same kind of report on weak in sale that some of the manufactur have report   dell  for exampl  and compaq have report that demand has held up quit well   so at this stage we   re nervous but we   re not yet will to conced that there has been    some sea chang go on in the tech sector   as i indic  the order pictur still look quit good in the aggreg   and we   re just read this as part of the nois associ with mani of these compani   for exampl intel   s stock price  which has taken such an enorm hit  is still back onli to where it was at the turn of the year  after have run up steepli   so we   re pay care attent but we don   t think this is necessarili the begin of some signific soften   obvious  if it were  it would be troubl becaus an import part not just of our aggreg demand forecast but our aggreg suppli forecast reli on sustain relat good perform on the invest side   so it is a concern  on the issu of refin capac  thing are tight domest   i don   t know about the rest of the world   we do think  howev  that there   s probabl a bit more elast in term of the abil to rais product  for exampl  of heat fuel go into the winter  than just look at the overal level of capac util might suggest   now  that mean  i think  that we will be more vulner to ani shock that could occur over the next few month  weather be the most obvious one   but judg from the price of both the heat fuel and crude oil  we   re not see someth that would suggest the anticip of except higher refin margin go into the winter  just normal season high type margin
i might be bold enough to add a thought regard domest refin  and that is the issu of mainten   there is some question as to how much refin capac will be shut down for routin mainten  whether or not that might be postpon a littl   that could give us some leeway to get a bit more product into inventori befor the mainten occur  with respect to refin capac oversea  the inform i have is that the refineri are oper at fair high level of capac  but not at what one would describ an absolut maximum  so  there is a small amount of room there   as to whether in the end that would result in product    trade that we wouldn   t ordinarili see happen in the unit state  i think there is some scope but not much scope   and ani accid in a refineri  or ani type of unexpect shutdown  could certain chang that pictur quick
i   d like to second bill pool   s compliment of the  book  not onli on the materi on oil price  but also on the simul with altern nairu and product assumpt   i know you   ve done these befor in the bluebook and elsewher  but with the potenti shock that are possibl now i think it make sens to put these type of exercis in the categori of thing that are done all the  e   with the simul now be elev to page i    of the  book  i think we   re get closer to that   and i think that   s good  also  go to half year  sn   t seem like a big deal   we   ve alway been abl to flip over to the   page and get the quarter number  but onli for the baselin   and if one is interest in the effect of a set of assumpt  it   s much more inform to have half year than full year   and third  i like the extens of the forecast horizon   we know that it   s hard to forecast two year out  but a lot of what we worri about here is in the drift   and often we realli can   t see that if the forecast just goe ahead anoth six quarter   this extens make the drift in the forecast veri appar   so in all sens  both the oil price analysi and the product nairu simul  this  book was to me much more inform than some of the earlier one
dave  let me ask you a question   in read the  book and your project  i know you haven   t chang your forecast much from the last  e   we need to adjust for energi  i understand   but in listen to you i sens a littl more of an acknowledg of some downsid risk in the economi emerg in manufactur and elsewher   is that a fair    descript of the tone that i heard this morn  that there is a sens of greater downsid risk than you felt befor  even though the project themselv are pretti much unchang
i   m not sure i would say that in the aggreg i see the downsid risk as larger than the upsid risk to this forecast   there are a coupl of area that i want to highlight  one relat to the develop in the technolog sector   second  while our simul suggest that the oil price increas should have a relat modest effect on overal output  i think there are risk in that regard as well   on the confid side  we haven   t seen much effect yet   nevertheless  one could easili imagin if we got not just a price spike but a true suppli disrupt compar to what was appar in europ this fall  there could be a more pronounc negat effect on overal sen ent   on the other hand  there are a coupl of area where we could envis some upsid risk   one i cite was the hous area   while we think that is like to be short live  we were surpris by the vigor of the recent rebound   and while consum spend has turn out pretti much as we had anticip  on the whole there has probabl been a firmer tone to what has occur in that sector   so i think we see a bit of upsid and downsid risk there   i think in a period of slow it   s natur to be more concern about the downsid risk one is identifi becaus often develop occur that tend to reinforc that downward momentum
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to add my thank to the staff for do as much work as they did  particular on the suppli side issu  forecast out further in  e  and the altern product and nairu simul  they were help to me in think about some of these issu     i   m interest in your tabl on structur labor product on page i     we use to think that product growth at someth around   percent  or mayb a littl lower  would doubl the standard of live of the unit state in someth like    year   in notic the tick up in structur labor product from     to     percent over the forecast period  i was struck by the fact that this would suggest that the  e period over which a doubl of the standard of live would occur is now someth closer to    year   that is rather awe inspir  and mayb it   s true   i guess there have been short period of  e in the past when that kind of product growth has occur  but think about it that way struck me  the second issu  with regard to the altern simul  involv the feedback effect from product into demand   we   re look at number  at   percent or a littl better for both      and       that are at least    percentag point or a bit more than the consensus of forecast  if one take away the assumpt about rise structur product  as you mention  demand is down to around the mid   percent rang   that   s a big chang   and it seem to have to do total with the feedback from product into demand  either posit or negat   i just thought i   d mention those point that occur to me as question or observ as i look at this and ask you to comment on them
with respect to the product forecast i   d say two thing   one is that we have had occas where multifactor product has risen at this pace for an extend period of  e   so this wouldn   t be someth that is unpreced histor   second  howev  if we were do a     or    year forecast  i don   t think we would necessarili project either the growth of multifactor product or the pace of capit deepen to be sustain at the kind of increas we are see now   in some sens the approach that we have shift to here  which    endogen these suppli side factor  mean that we are also go to be sensit to futur busi cycl where a period of slow in overal activ could feed back into invest and therefor
so this is sort of temporari
yes  in the sens that we   re onli forecast out through        over a long term horizon i   d certain hate to be pin down in forecast develop in an area where we have not exact cover ourselv in glori even over the short term   but i would caution that if i were a budget analyst  i wouldn   t necessarili take that      figur and extend it out for the next        year
so do you have ani idea where this plateaus
as the chairman has note mani  e  we   re not sure where we are in this technolog diffus process   that knowledg realli is so import in term of get to the crux of this matter   and it is just terribl difficult to know   thus far the overal return to capit has not shown ani sign of tip down  though one might expect it to do so   if we were realli push capit deepen in a sens beyond where it ought to be  we would expect to see a signific weak   now i would quick want to
there has been a bit of a downturn from the veri high level
yes  that   s true  there has been just a tad   the downturn is pretti much within the nois of those data at this point   but i would also caution that what we are realli observ there is the averag return to capit  not the margin return to capit   if one were concern about the tech sector  for exampl  it   s possibl that the most recent invest aren   t go to reach the same rate of return that investor either are look for or have experienc in the recent past   so i think there are some risk there as well   we just don   t know where we are in that    technolog spread process at this point   nevertheless  at this stage we don   t see ani reason to think that it   s go to be on a slow trend in term of multifactor product  with respect to the feedback effect  in the case where we show a lower growth of structur product  those effect are quit potent in the model for the reason that we discuss earlier this year on the up side   in that simul there are go to be some signific disappoint in the growth of output and the growth in profit   those disappoint would lead to some retrench in overal equiti market  as well as some downshift in peopl   s desir to add to the capit stock of hous and automobil and other consum durabl  that in turn lead that simul to produc a signific weaken in overal activ from it recent pace   but even with that weaken  that lower product assumpt is potent enough that we could still get some increas in overal inflat   so it   s the worst of all possibl world
yes   slower growth  higher inflat
if nobodi els has question or comment  would somebodi like to start the committe discuss   presid parri
mr  chairman  employ in the west continu to expand at a solid       percent pace in juli and august   in contrast to the remaind of the district  california   s job count has slow somewhat in recent month   the data show weak in busi servic  in part due to layoff at some dot com  although indic are that those laid off are have no troubl find job   construct employ also has tail off   even so  the employ statist may be overst the slow in the state  given that growth in incom tax withhold in california has remain strong  an area of strength in the district has been high tech activ relat to semiconductor manufactur   the semiconductor industri has ad manufactur job in the district this year     follow two year of job cut   and worldwid semiconductor sale are run well ahead of last year   the pickup reflect strength in the demand for chip use in internet relat product  hand  held comput  and communic devic  across the district  howev  real estat activ  both commerci and residenti construct  is moder   offic rent have level off in a number of citi in the region  includ los angel  san diego  phoenix  las vega  and salt lake citi   in contrast  rent continu to climb in the san francisco bay and the seattl area   price for wholesal electr remain high and volatil in the west   the california public util commiss has adopt a rate stabil plan for the deregul san diego area   howev  this plan  along with the exist rate ceil in other part of california where deregul has been onli part phase in  has onli put off the decis about who will cover the billion of dollar in revenu shortfal for compani such as san diego gas and electr  pacif gas and electr  and southern california edison  turn to the nation economi  i find it encourag that core inflat hasn   t acceler in recent month despit higher oil price and that the pace of econom activ seem to have moder in the third quarter   like the  book  our real gdp forecast for that quarter show an increas of   percent  which is down about    percentag point from our august forecast  obvious  it   s too earli to tell if the slowdown will be sustain  but develop in financi market this year  with modest lower equiti valu and a higher dollar in combin with our past tighten action  should help to contain demand   of cours  the wild card for both inflat and econom activ is energi price  which have defi expect of a substanti declin for some  e now   our longer term forecast show growth in real gdp slow from       percent this year to a rang of       to   percent next year under the assumpt of no further chang in the fund rate and a constant valu of the u s  dollar     even with the slowdown we are expect  labor market will remain tight through the end of next year  generat some upward pressur on core inflat   higher energi price also have boost our forecast of core inflat to some extent   as in the  book  our forecast assum that energi price will declin over the next sever quarter  which work to obscur upward pressur in our core inflat measur   we expect core pce price to increas about   percent this year and slight more next year   overal inflationari risk may have lessen a bit sinc we met in august as it now seem more like that the economi realli has enter a slow phase   but to me the balanc of risk for inflat go forward still is on the up side and i don t think we should be content with core inflat measur as high as   percent  especi given the likelihood that they may be rise   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i would now character growth in our southeast region as moder   while condit have not chang materi sinc our last meet  we are see some further sign of slow in the pace of growth  and i will mention just a few  more retail than befor are acknowledg that sale are fall below plan and those expect had alreadi been adjust down   the trade imbal is veri obvious in our port citi where import are expand at twice the rate of export   and we may be see the first hint of some slow in the pace of tourism   fall book in our major tourist market are just slight ahead of last year and growth in casino along the mississippi gulf coast has slow mark   the latter may be at least partial attribut to satur and some environment control over develop  we tri to keep an especi close eye on real estat sinc it has been our region   s achill heel more than onc in past cycl   although the fdic recent includ atlanta among    citi where it has concern about overbuild in commerci real estat  our economist and bank examin have not yet seen the telltal sign of troubl   offic vacanc rate remain in the    to    percent rang in the district   s major metropolitan area   and commerci industri vacanc rate in all but orlando have remain stabl or declin in the past year or so   one area we are watch in atlanta is the depend of the offic market on high tech compani   in      high tech tenant account for    percent of the net absorpt of new offic space  although a good share of that was establish mainlin high tech compani and not the more volatil dot com   we also note a grow sens of general caution as the pace of econom activ has moder   our larger bank report that loan demand has declin notic from year ago level   and there is evid that financ term are now more stringent  especi for second tier borrow   i also hear more stori of project be put on hold until the futur path of the economi becom clearer  as i note when we last met  there are a few place where labor market are a bit less tight  but our region unemploy rate is still a tick or two below the nation level and labor avail remain an issu   we detect no specif area of new price pressur other than a general concern about higher energi cost  their futur path  and the longer term implic  as far as the broader nation economi is concern  we see further confirm evid of the moder we talk about in august   as has alreadi been note  in addit to a slow in hous and auto  manufactur  especi outsid of high tech  continu to moder   our model work suggest that the moder rate of growth will like continu   like other  we have spent consider  e tri to assess the implic of the run up in oil price   and i would echo the comment of other that the staff paper we got on that subject were particular help  while clear there has been some modest impact on gdp  it   not appear to be larg   perhap the most import implic may be the effect on inflat expect  as the most recent run up    work it way through the headlin inflat measur and as consum begin to get their winter heat bill   if the higher oil price turn out to be short live  as futur market believ to be the case  then this may turn out to be onli a modest shock  we are encourag by the general benign inflat data  although when one decompos the current inflat path into the energi compon and other compon  there remain an upward tilt in core price that should not be discount   i think we have to be pleas with the moder we are get in econom activ and the more sustain path the economi seem to have settl into   at the same  e  i believ it would be prematur to adjust our much watch balanc of risk statement   for me at least  there are a number of upsid risk on the inflat front   those includ the uncertainti about the long term sustain of the recent veri larg product gain and their implic for unit labor cost  the possibl of a more s ul fiscal polici  and the real and expect inflat effect of higher energi cost still work their way through the pipelin   i think we are where we want to be  at least for the moment   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  at our meet in august the inform on our district that i had at the  e suggest a more mix pictur in the lower middl atlant region  at least by comparison to the unambigu strong growth we were see in the first half of the year  and the pictur is still mix   as has been mention for other district  there are sign of moder activ in some sector   higher fuel price are damp sale of vehicl general  especi the larger suv and truck   they are squeez the profit of some of the truck compani in our region  and we have a larg number of these compani   but at the same  e  a signific portion of the anecdot inform we have receiv in the last two or three week suggest that demand may be strengthen  or at least not weaken ani further   just to cite a    coupl of exampl to back that up   back to school sale were report to be unexpect strong in our region  and those are some  said to be harbing of upcom holiday sale  recent declin in mortgag rate have definit s ul new residenti construct and sale of both new and exist home in our area  and respond to our latest month servic sector survey indic that their revenu were firm  also  labor market are still veri tight in our area   our small busi and agricultur advisori council met last week  and though they told the same old stori of a tight job market i was struck by the intens of some of the comment member made about the competit for capabl worker   one fellow said that he had recent rais wage rate across the board by about    percent to stop what he refer to as    poach    of his workforc by his competitor  in sum  of cours it is alway hard to know whether this somewhat stronger tone in the last sever week is just nois or perhap season influenc   nevertheless  i have some sens at least that busi activ is no longer deceler in our region  with respect to the nation economi  i think the key question right now center on the under growth rate of structur product  the extent to which that growth rate is anticip and perceiv by the public  and the net impact of those two factor on inflat go forward   i see that impact work through two channel   first  the effect on the aggreg demand suppli balanc and second  the effect on unit labor cost   and i want to add my compliment to the other you ve receiv  dave and    becaus the simul  especi the one on product  were veri help in think through these issu   i know i am repeat other compliment  but i have been read these  book for    year and i think you are on a roll  the baselin  book forecast project high but fair steadi structur product growth over the forecast horizon that is fulli anticip by the public   i think that is a key point   if    that turn out to be right  then the appar moder in demand nation over the second and third quarter may be a good sign   it may indic that we have the real fund rate now where it need to be to bring the growth of aggreg demand in line with the sustain growth of potenti output   but  obvious  there are other possibl outcom and you recogn a lot of these   we could have a further acceler of structur product growth  although that is not veri like at this point given the level of your project   a more like prospect  i think  is that the increas project by the  book for the current year and for      and      are not yet fulli anticip  they are  after all  higher than most of the publish or public announc privat sector project and simul i ve seen   if the  book project are right  expect futur incom and wealth would rise as the public recogn that product growth is higher than they had anticip  and that could generat renew excess growth in demand go forward   now  your product surpris simul  of cours  incorpor this effect and recogn that at some point that could put upward pressur on inflat   but the actual number in your simul show virtual no effect  at least for the next coupl of year   i guess what happen is that the presum posit effect on demand is outweigh by the negat effect on unit labor cost   and i recogn that thing could well work out that way   but the near term impact of a further increas in expect incom and wealth on aggreg demand could well be greater over the forecast horizon of the next few year than the simul suggest   that could be a problem sinc we are alreadi see at least an uptick in core inflat   and mani peopl are project a further increas as recent energi price work their way through the economi or if the dollar drop more than anticip in the  book forecast   so  like other  i think the balanc of risk is still on the up side  though mayb not as decid as it was a while back   therefor  i also think that we should leav the tilt in our press releas in place     i believ it is worth remind ourselv in this context that the acceler technolog progress and capit deepen are not the onli factor drive the    new economi     if that is inde what we have   anoth absolut critic element has been our enhanc credibl  first  that we have achiev price stabil or some close approxim of it and second  that the credibl of our strategi is so much stronger than it was   and i don   t think we should take that credibl for grant   i think the latter part of bob parri   s statement was right on the money and i would certain agre with his point of view on that   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   it is a pleasur to have an opportun to talk about condit in the third district   activ in our district is basic flat  with some declin in interest rate sensit sector   employ declin for the first two month of the third quarter  but most of that was attribut to the verizon strike and the layoff of census worker  the unemploy rate has remain steadi at about     percent for the three state  slight below the nation s     percent rate   consum price inflat is acceler in the district but remain below that of the nation   employ cost acceler in the first half of the year reflect tighter labor market   somewhat surpris  given the recent increas in oil price  manufactur in our busi outlook survey report less upward pressur on price paid than they did earlier in the year   most manufactur are hold their own price steadi   sign of slow are found in construct and bank loan growth   hous permit  employ in the construct sector  the valu of residenti and nonresidenti contract  and both exist and new home sale are down from level at the begin of the year   at the same  e  c i  consum  and residenti mortgag lend have slow somewhat sinc june   while retail sale did show a rebound as a result of back to school sale  year over year increas were below expect  contrari to some of the    comment of other here today   and retail sale were flat this summer   the outlook over the next six month is that growth will resum but that the pace will be no fa  than in the first half  in term of our perspect on the nation  econom growth in our view slow in the third quarter toward it long term trend rate but may be pick up in the fourth quarter   household invest in hous and vehicl slow from the pace we saw earlier in the year but appear to have stabil   still  if oil price remain high  the effect on growth could be negat  though probabl not as big as the effect in the     s and     s   equiti market investor suggest that there is a fear of a slowdown and their violent reaction to earn disappoint is noteworthi  on the inflat side  rise oil price have led to an acceler in consum and produc price inflat   more troubl is the fact that core inflat has also shown a moder acceler   over this expans cpi inflat has averag about     percent  but it is not like to fall further base on recent inflat figur and the staff forecast   both of these factor suggest that inflationari expect are a real concern go forward  so i share some of the reserv about the futur that have been express here today  we like to think about this in an histor perspect   in the fall of      the fed lower the fed fund rate by    basi point in three step in the wake of a financi crisi   it is like that the data after that point realli reflect the core inflat react to the expans   the fed has subsequ rais the fed fund rate to     percent and that may be enough to stem the acceler of core inflat  the tighten the fed has done to date has not yet been fulli felt in the economi  but higher product growth suggest that the equilibrium real rate should be higher   observ inflat is like to be higher and the growth of the good and labor market is still someth to watch   long term inflat expect in our survey of profession forecast have been hold steadi  which is interest   respond still anticip that the cpi over a ten year period    will be     percent   they believ  i guess  that inflat will be held in check by the feder reserv  that is the end of my formal remark  but i feel some oblig to commend the staff   i can t do so on a relat basi  i don   t have that framework   but in an absolut sens i can say that i did enjoy and appreci the hard work they did in the materi provid to us   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   recent one director start off the go  around at our board meet by relat what he consid to be an anecdot about condit in labor market   but i interpret it somewhat differ  and i ll come back to that   he said he    overheard anoth custom in a store where he was shop complain to the manag about one of the store   s employe   and the manag respond      it is easier to get a new custom than it is to get a new employe       laughter   that rais in my mind the question about appropri qualiti adjust in the servic sector  and we could all probabl compar anecdot stori about that  as for other report about labor market  layoff have been announc by eaton  dana  and smaller truck part compani   keycorp has announc a veri major layoff  which is not limit to our district but

bounc     a manufactur distributor of packag pastri said that corpor are cut their gift budget  and order for the fourth quarter are off signific from a year ago   i   m not sure how to interpret that particular anecdot becaus a year ago i assum a lot of compani had plan substanti gift budget for y k reward and recognit   so a year over year comparison might not be veri reliabl   in the retail sector go forward  we were remind that novemb last year was veri weak  so on a year over year basi novemb should be good   if it is not  that ought to be signific   and there is an extra saturday and more day between thanksgiv and christma this year  so the retail are op ist that they will do better in decemb over decemb as well  one of our director who is affili with a nation newspap chain report that ad revenu has been off sharpli in the last coupl of month   anoth report  with respect to the retail sector  that in the past    day the ftc has sharpli increas the fine they impos on retail for fail to meet promis deliveri schedul  which is probabl pretti sober for the onlin sale sector  in manufactur  truck assembl and part have been off sharpli this year   also  the veri much higher diesel cost  one contact assert that diesel fuel price were doubl what they were but i don t know the  efram he was use  have great increas the oper cost of the truck compani that are headquart in the region  some of which oper nation of cours  a character of how pervas the effect may be was the suggest that part becaus of just in  e inventori  we should start think that the unit state has put it warehous on wheel  and roll warehous do consum fuel  report from both larg and small bank indic that even in the face of slow loan demand and a dwindl number of applic in the pipelin  propos are now be turn    down that would have been accept a year ago   banker also tell us that not onli have their interest margin narrow consider this year but that they expect margin to be thinner yet next year  turn to the nation economi  i also thought all of the simul provid by the staff were use   i think these kind of exercis  static as they some  are  and i recogn that get them to be dynam and interact is quit difficult  are veri use to condit our think   if one reflect on what has happen over the last few year  in oil price  product  econom growth  and exchang rate in a coupl of notabl instanc  we might have been better abl to think through the appropri polici had we sensit ourselv more to the implic of these kind of event   but look back at the rang of develop over the last few year  my guess is that we would have had a veri hard  e imagin just how far a number of these thing would go   so  look out at least to      is a veri desir thing for us to do   and i agre with the suggest that look out even further would be help  even if we don t have a lot of confid in ani one scenario actual play out or come close to what actual will happen  i think back to four or five year ago and the inherit situat at the  e  with inflat somewher in the   to   percent rang depend on which measur one look at   had we been abl to anticip the acceler in product growth from about   percent or so then to where we have seen it in recent year  in an ideal polici sens i would have prefer to take all of that gain in product to lower the rate of inflat   i would have favor a veri opportunist respons in order to lock the gain in product into a lower inflat trend   we took mayb half of that  it s a veri judgment thing   i think some of the favor develop in product have reduc the trend rate of inflat  but not by as much as i would have like   go forward  i would like to be abl to take advantag of all of ani further increas in product growth to lower the inherit rate of inflat  whatev the under monetari inflat trend may be     that   rais a question of strategi  in term of how we would go about do that   the baselin forecast in the  book has us start off from the current posit  where the economi is oper somewhat abov some notion of our nation potenti   and as skeptic as i am in today s world about the notion of a potenti output either in labor market or some other way of measur our capac  i don t find that approach veri convinc   i am just not sure and i wouldn   t know how to convinc somebodi els that we are now oper abov capac   nevertheless  go forward the baselin forecast has output grow somewhat more slowli than potenti growth  so that take some of the pressur off inflat in the framework that is be use there  but that   rais a question about how we think about the increas in interest rate sinc june of       particular the fed fund rate   i still don t find it use to think in term of a real fed fund rate   normal when we talk about real interest rate in a   equat sens  we say that the appropri horizon for the expect rate of inflat is the durat of the instrument we are talk about  whether it s the    year  the    year  or whatev   well  in that sens  i find it troubl to think about a real compon in the overnight interbank rate   instead  i like to think about whether or not the current nomin fed fund rate is calibr at a level that will ensur that we do not  in an accommod sens  inject excess central bank liquid   do so would turn a favor real side develop  product growth  into an excess demand situat  therebi creat inflat  i   m not there at this point   i cannot conclud that a fed fund rate of       percent is too low   i would be look for evid of these favor product develop show through in other market measur  especi in financi market  tell me that the       percent nomin fed fund rate is too low   it   s a veri tough issu   so at the moment as i look out to      and the baselin forecast  my own veri loos judgment would be that the trend rate of inflat is go to be declin in      rather than rise  especi if the forecast is correct about product growth
thank you    to avoid the coffe break run into lunch  i suggest we paus here and resum with tom hoenig   coffe break

thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district as a region is continu to do veri well in term of econom activ  but it is appar to us that growth is slow   while overal employ growth in the district is about the same as in the nation  privat employ growth is about    percentag point slower overal   nonresidenti construct reflect the softer condit in our area   the valu of district nonresidenti construct has fallen in three of the last four month and remain signific below previous peak in the region   homebuild also has slow  not as dramat perhap  but it   s still a coupl of percentag point below year ago    level   manufactur activ in the district also has moder   manufactur job actual fell about     percent in august and are down about     percent from a year ago   so  we have seen some slow there  in part due to higher fuel cost and so forth  of cours  the area in our district that is sudden do well relat to the oil and gas industri  especi natur gas   like texa  we produc a lot of natur gas   our rig count is up about     percent and employ in that sector is up rather signific as well   so we do have activ start to pick up now as peopl are becom more confid that higher oil price are go to last for a while and are therefor will to bring some activ back into play  retail sale general have been steadi and actual have been fair strong in the denver area  as has the whole economi in that region   but  overal  with some slow we have seen a littl loosen of labor market condit   the unemploy rate remain about the same or a bit higher in differ area of the region as well   price pressur have also remain steadi  despit the fact that some raw materi cost  of cours  are go up and have to be dealt with by the manufactur compani   we haven   t seen those higher cost come through at all at the retail level  we   ve actual heard some talk of eas price pressur there  our agricultur sector is still see veri weak price   that industri is veri much depend upon govern payment and will continu to be so through next year at least  base on the bumper product we see in our region   so we have a strong economi but with some slow appar  at the nation level  incom data have done littl to chang my outlook on the economi   from the inform i have heard here and our own analysi i would say that growth of econom activ is in a longer term slow phase   sinc the begin of the year  i think the flat stock market  the higher energi cost in play  and the tighter monetari polici have cool off    consum spend   and while invest spend remain veri good  our project is that it growth will be down from the earlier high level  and i think that will play a role as well   as compar to the  book forecast  our project is for a step down of gdp growth toward the       percent area   we also see that occur without further increas in the fed fund rate from it level today   the risk  of cours  are relat to energi  which we   ve talk about   and  yes  energi cost could push overal price up and that could actual slow the economi   the situat could be complic if person incom level fall and the debt burden in our economi have to be dealt with   so  those are the downsid risk  in essenc  while i wouldn   t fall on my sword on this  mr  chairman  i think the risk are more balanc than they have been   i would feel comfort say that with a balanc risk statement  even with these econom project  becaus i think the higher rate are still in play  we have seen a slow expans and i think that is continu  which give us a pictur of an economi with more balanc risk in the futur   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as the headlin in the wall street journal   s new england econom focus put it      economi slow  but veri gentl      in fact  it is rather hard to see the slow   hous is off a bit but manufactur and manufactur export remain strong  employ growth  net of strike and census worker nois  has deceler but it   s not much differ from the histor norm for the region   moreov  the size of the new england labor forc has level off this year after sever year of expans   and the labor forc particip rate  at least in massachusett  is down from the rather high level of the mid     s   both the slow growth in employ and the veri low rate of region unemploy  which is fulli       percentag point below the nation rate  probabl reflect the same phenomenon  at least in part  that there aren   t    mani more worker to go around   this ought to be caus wage to rise and to some extent it is  manufactur and retail report   to   percent base wage increas  though manufactur are grant much higher wage to employe with sought after skill   temporari firm also report higher wage  in the rang of    to    percent abov last year  across a wide rang of profess  measur of local inflat continu to reflect a higher rate of increas than in the nation as a whole  in particular  energi cost  both oil and natur gas  rose at better than a    percent pace from juli      to juli        hous price as well are up at rate surpass those of the nation  especi in massachusett and new hampshir  with price in metro boston rise at better than    percent  a recent experi provid at least one reflect of this local trend   i host a month breakfast with   to    more or less random chosen employe   the discuss center around the challeng employe face at the bank and issu they believ are of concern   and it follow whatev direct the employe want to take it   the specif have vari over  e  but this  e there was some focus on price and rise cost   the question  to quot one employe  was      whi   everyon say inflat is not a problem when the cost of mani of the thing i care most about  medic care  hous  public transport  gasolin  heat oil  and educ  are all rise rapid      now this may have been a play for a higher wage increas  laughter  but i don   t think it was so specif   it was a general concern and the rest of the peopl in the room second the sen ent  of cours  if we begin to see more of an econom slow  perhap some of the pressur will come off   we   ve just complet our usual round of fall banker    forum  three program in main  massachusett  and connecticut   a primari question i ask of everyon i talk to was whether or not activ in their area was slow down   answer vari  but the largest share of banker believ that strong growth was continu and that competit  if anyth  was more    intens   other  howev  were see some pullback in residenti construct and mortgag lend   in sum  the new england region may well be slow  but the process is gentl to say the least and  depend on the area and industri  perhap impercept  turn to the nation scene  sign of slow may be a bit more evid than they are in new england  but the data here are mix as well   employ growth is slower  the unemploy rate is up a tick  and hous measur are off their recent high   but confid is high   home buy condit are better  given recent mortgag trend   retail sale and other sign of consumpt seem to have bounc back in the late summer   the stock market seem to have bought the idea of an econom slowdown  and earn warn are more and more common  corpor leverag is grow   at the same  e  credit market seem to be distinguish among borrow  with spread rise for lower qualiti credit   tighter financi condit are like a healthi develop  howev   and profit  while slow  are do so from veri healthi second quarter level  look forward  the  book project what could onli be view as nirvana  continu domest strength  no particular extern drag  grow rate of structur product  a slight rise in unemploy  but larg quiescent inflat into        but this forecast seem surround by more than the usual sens of uncertainti   i think that is reflect in the fact that it took    altern simul    laughter   they were great  but there were a lot of them   the stock market could be weaker or stronger  oil price higher or lower  the dollar stronger or weaker  and the fiscal s ulus greater   but variat in two factor seem to make the most signific differ in the forecast  in the face of continu relat strong domest demand   and these  of cours  are the measur of suppli  structur product growth and chang in the level of resourc util consist with stabl inflat over the medium term  that is  the nairu     forecast with lower structur product growth get higher inflat   in fact  on the basi of our own forecast in boston we would argu that there is a possibl at least that demand will not slow as much as is shown in this lower product altern  and inflat could well rise quit a bit in that scenario   on the other hand  with a lower nairu  we could get signific slower inflationari growth  so what are we to make of all of this uncertainti   well  to me  common sens suggest that in the face of uncertainti we should be cautious both in what we do and in what we say  moreov  while there are a lot of factor at play  a few thing seem indisput in the short run  labor market are tight   domest demand may be slow but remain robust   and world demand is grow as well  with the inevit impact on the extern sector for us   rise product may well save the day  but it seem unlik that inflat will go down ani  e soon and it may well escal   that  i think  should be our primari concern   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the economi of the ninth district remain healthi  but i think there are sign of moder activ   on the posit side  labor market continu to be veri tight   the agricultur sector is do better than expect  main becaus crop are turn out to be veri larg   the mine and energi sector are expand   and while the pictur in construct  both residenti and nonresidenti  is mix  overal i think activ in that sector has probabl level off at a relat high level   the major area of slow appear to be in consum spend  and i   ll come back to that in a minut  as far as the nation is concern  i think the outlook remain posit   our project are for a continu of signific real growth through       although at a pace somewhat below the  book forecast   and we have inflat stabil  albeit at a bit higher rate than our former    forecast   what is new  at least to me  is what i   ve been hear anecdot from retail and from analyst who follow retail   they are report a signific slow in consum spend or at least disappoint sale over the last sever month   now  this inform is anecdot  it   s not a scientif sampl   there may be a lot of nois in it  but i don   t doubt the sincer of the report  in the sens that retail do seem to be great disappoint with what they have seen recent   and this is from some fair signific player in the retail sector   thank you
mr  chairman  the second district   s economi has continu to expand at a moder pace sinc my last report  while consum price inflat has remain subdu in the face of ongo  though diminish  cost pressur   after adjust for the verizon strike  privat sector job growth acceler notic in august to a more than   percent annual rate  though the reduct of census worker appear to have boost the unemploy rate slight   retail sale appar turn sluggish again in mid septemb follow a brief pickup earli in the month  while retail price remain virtual flat   our sourc are give virtual the same stori that presid  n just describ of a notic slow in retail sale and consider concern about the holiday season  while new york citi   s offic market remain extrem tight  residenti real estat market appear to have cool a bit   home construct activ has taper off notic in the third quarter  although some of this slow  especi in northern new jersey  seem to reflect land and labor constraint   home price in new york citi are up    to    percent from a year ago but that repres a slight deceler  and unit sale continu to declin   hous market in upstat new york are mix but on balanc improv   purchas manag in the region report continu growth in manufactur activ  with some diminut in price pressur in septemb   and local    bank report a continu of recent trend  weaken loan demand  tighten credit standard  and fall delinqu rate  a bank supervisor   s dream  we think the nation economi is slow just as monetari polici tighten by this committe intend it to slow   we share the view that energi cost will not caus great damag  my own view is that the forward market are not accur reflect the increas suppli that will result from the increas invest take place  as presid hoenig describ for his district   if i am right and therefor energi price begin to trail off after the winter in the northern hemispher  that should bring energi price down just about in  e to avoid what i think is the consider risk of the higher energi price increas inflat expect  our research indic that the product revolut is continu and is spread more broad to the mani user of technolog   and  therefor  we agre with the  book   s view and perhap are even more op ist   i also believ that our economi has now demonstr for long enough an abil to oper with an unemploy rate at or near   percent that we can presum that it is like to continu to do so for at least a while   our growth forecast has the economi expand below potenti  which we put at       percent per annum   we think the present stanc of monetari polici is just where it should be   as we get into next year i think there will be a question as to whether our assess of the balanc of risk will have to be shift   but for the present i believ that the formal statement that the balanc of risk is toward inflat continu to be the correct one   thank you
mr  chairman  as i wander around my district  i alway ask the question    what   s new      and the answer is not much   it seem to be pretti much steadi as she goe   i recent had a trip to  erson citi  which is obvious not a veri big market   the overal    unemploy rate there is around   percent and the big issu in that area is a new one for them  the import of mexican worker   and i think that exampl is one of mani that we could cite of just how import the strength in our labor market has been for improv the alloc of resourc in both the labor and capit market   we certain want to do everyth we possibl can to keep that go  and that is whi maintain stabil on the inflat front is critic  i do have one issu with presid jordan   jerri  entertain spend for sport may be a problem in cleveland  but it is do just fine in st  loui    laughter  my up contact was not avail this  e  but my fedex contact said that his firm continu to see veri strong demand with the except of heavi freight  which goe by truck   and that observ tie in with the inform we have on the auto industri and the truck industri  we know that sector has slow a bit   so that report simpli confirm what we are awar of from other sourc   overal  the situat is fair steadi accord to my fedex contact   intern busi continu to be veri robust  grow by    to    percent year over year   and it   s strong not onli for shipment into the unit state but also for outbound shipment   in fact  he said there has been a pickup in u s  outbound shipment   and up busi is veri robust within foreign economi  particular in asia  which would suggest that econom activ abroad is continu to do veri well   fedex continu to have difficulti attract entri level worker  that is a problem we hear about over and over again   and fedex still see signific compens pressur at the profession level   but compani manag are convinc that product improv are cover those cost  so they don   t see them pass through to their price   the except  of cours  is fuel   fedex has put on fuel surcharg and it custom have accept the surcharg without complaint   it   s just a fact of busi  and those ad cost are be pass through with no difficulti     on the nation pictur  i would simpli like to emphas that the energi price increas realli are impact a lot of peopl   of cours  the rise in the aggreg cpi over the past    month is now run around       percent  that is up a lot   it   s driven almost entir by energi but that still involv a veri signific adjust for peopl from what they were see previous   so i want to emphas that one shouldn   t read energi out of the cpi and say everyth is just fine  as some comment seem to do  though i don   t think that   s true of those around this tabl   i believ that we realli do have to pay attent to the aggreg cpi when the increas has been as long stand and as persist as this increas is becom now
thank you  mr  chairman   use what i   ll call a level test  i think that overal monetari polici is rough in balanc   with real interest rate in the neighborhood of   percent  minim term premium  and a core inflat rate of about   percent  the equilibrium fund rate should be in the neighborhood of   percent   ad in a slight premium to cover the balanc of risk lead to the present fund rate of       percent  a rate that seem about right for today   s condit   perhap the biggest question is whether we should elimin our upward bias   one could argu for that by note that the prospect growth of final demand realli has slow quit sharpli from earlier in the year   at this rate  it may not be too long befor i join tom hoenig in think that the risk have becom even balanc   yet at this point i think that such a chang in our postur is still prematur   i still believ that the fundament risk of inflat are on the up side and i would like to retain our present polici stanc at least for a while  i have reach that conclus for five reason   let me tri to give them quick   one is prudenc   in this day when fiscal policymak seem to be throw prudenc to the wind  somebodi has to stress limit and the import of stabl price   that may as well be us   the    second is nairu   i have often mention my suspicion that nairu could be as low as the   percent featur in the  book simul   i do like the outcom of that simul and i think it is at least somewhat like   but a suspicion that nairu is low is not the same as proof  and the better part of valor say that we should move cautious befor effect reject the standard es  of nairu   third is invest   there is still a veri strong invest boom in progress  histor when invest has been this strong for this long  inflat has ensu   i suspect it may not this  e around for reason we have often discuss  but again suspicion is not the same as proof   fourth is product   to the extent that wage have lag the product chang  there has been downward pressur on unit labor cost  upward pressur on the dollar  and downward pressur on import price   but as wage catch up to the product increas  an event that seem like at some point  mani of the inflat reduc benefit of the product shock could erod  the last reason is energi   we   ve talk about that plenti and i won   t elabor  but it   s certain an upsid risk  in all these way i think the fundament risk of inflat are still on the up side   in the long run i believ our oper answer to this set of circumst is forward look  flexibl  inflat target  a type of approach i   ve tri to describ in previous meet   in the shorter run  in term of what we should do today  i have a shorter answer  no chang
thank you  mr  chairman   like other  my read of the incom data is that they do point main to a continu moder in econom growth to a pace that i believ is below the economi   s potenti   in addit to the econom data that have come in  i think the more forward look indic of real activ also support the notion of some slow in train   the purchas manag    report for new order is the most recent exampl in that categori   also  as i    believ     was suggest  the financi market  though not unambigu  certain do seem to be consist with a slow   they obvious have some concern about it pace  but i think they are suggest a slow is in train  now have said that  the  book and the econom data point to a number of risk  one we   ve alreadi talk about  which is oil   like ned    i will restrain myself on that subject except to observ that the one thing we haven   t talk about is the great risk of an upsid price surpris that come from either polit instabl or will misbehavior on the part of some of the produc of oil   i think that is still a possibl   though it  sn   t appear to be the most like outcom  it   s one we do have to be awar of  the second risk that i see in the forecast is that the  book assum that invest in product enhanc capit good will continu unab even as credit condit tighten and the pace of growth slow   given the role that the suppli side of the economi has play for the last sever year and the observ that no economi seem to have manag to sustain product increas in the high singl digit for sever year  this is to me a veri import assumpt   it rest on the view that a larg chunk of invest spend continu to be done by establish firm with relat strong credit rate who are like to emerg from this mild cyclic slow in veri good shape   while it is true that most capit spend  at least among the largest compani  is done by invest grade firm  about a quarter of it is done by firm that are not invest grade  so i see some potenti risk there that we should be mind of   i would also observ that we   ve seen some negat earn surpris from some of the major particip in the new economi  includ cisco system which build router that are the backbon for the internet  appl comput  and intel   that goe back to the semiconductor stori   none of those stori is yet enough to say that this new economi  product enhanc suppli shock we   ve had is over   but i    think we do have to be mind that there is at least a risk that the pace of invest in this expans may slow  which would lead to unfortun outcom with respect to product  employ  and also inflat  a combin of develop that would be challeng for us  in a more posit sens of risk  i was glad to see that the staff includ an altern simul with a nairu at   percent   like ned    i   ve certain toy with the possibl of a low nairu in that area   in the  e i   ve been here at the board we   ve had unemploy run somewher between     and     percent and inflat has been quit quiescent  partial for special factor   nevertheless  it   leav open the possibl that in fact the so call nairu is down at that level   i find it instruct that the staff at least seem to think the probabl of a nairu at that lower level is about    percent  more or less   again  i think it   s too earli to presum that   s the answer and too earli to base polici on it   but it   s interest that we can even have a discuss where the possibl of nairu at around   to       percent is definit on the tabl  when i put all of these certainti and uncertainti togeth  it seem to me as though the best polici stanc for now is steadi as she goe   a slow   seem to be well under way  not requir ani further action   i do think that the balanc of risk statement should continu to be focus on inflat   we have tight labor market   there is some uncertainti about oil   the fiscal polici situat is a littl uncertain   and if it turn out that the economi can maintain noninflationari growth at an unemploy rate as low as today   s  then a gradual polici will allow us to discov that truth over  e as well   so  i believ we should stand pat as we are and just continu to monitor incom data as we have been
thank you  mr  chairman   i will focus my remark this morn on what i view as the three key theme in the  book forecast   while     has alreadi    emphas the consider uncertainti that attach to each of them  these theme are consist with the qualit aspect of my own view of the outlook   first  the economi appear to be make a transit from abov trend to below trend growth   second  the balanc of risk is nevertheless toward rise core inflat   and this risk not onli persist throughout the forecast period  it will like remain for a consider period of  e thereaft   third  if oil price declin over the next two year  consist with expect in futur price  overal consum price inflat will like declin next year and the upward drift in core inflat will be signific restrain over the forecast period  the balanc of risk toward higher inflat  even if growth remain modest below trend  reflect an assess that the prevail unemploy rate is below the short run nairu and the prospect that the short run nairu will rise as product growth stabil  or at least rise at a slower rate than over the last sever year   the upward pressur on core inflat in the  book come from the gap between the prevail unemploy rate and the staff   s       percent es  of the short run nairu   the staff project no increas in the short run nairu over the forecast period   and a subsequ converg toward the long run nairu would presum be a sourc of continu inflat pressur beyond the forecast period  there have been alreadi mani well deserv compliment to the author of the  book  but i can   t resist note that no member of this committe has a greater appreci for their care analysi of the unemploy rate relat to the short run nairu and the long run nairu than i do   of cours  the staff took no chanc in this  book   with all the altern simul  includ the one with a   percent long run nairu  there was someth for everybodi   and that   s a good thing  i   m sure     the first two theme in the  book stori  below trend growth and rise core inflat  are featur of what i have call a    revers soft land      there is a transit to growth at potenti from an initi point abov potenti via a period of below trend growth   dure the transit demand pressur result in an upward trend for core inflat unless other suppli shock interven   so while mani outsid and some insid the fomc will regret a slowdown to below trend growth  i continu to believ that such a revers soft land is the most benign outcom possibl  given my assess of the relationship between actual and potenti output today  the earlier period of abov trend growth and declin core inflat and the project of below trend growth and rise inflat over the forecast period are  in my view  two side of the economi s adjust to the acceler in product growth   initi  an acceler in product yield a power disinflationari impetus   it may allow a declin in both unemploy and inflat   that is the bright side of the adjust to the acceler of product that we have enjoy for the last four or five year   it has offer policymak a choic among onli favor outcom  temporarili lower unemploy  lower inflat  or some combin   now the  e may have arriv when we have to face the other side of that adjust   when the temporari disinflationari impetus of the product gain dissip  the demand pressur at the prevail unemploy rate will begin to show through to higher unit labor cost and inflat unless  of cours  product growth continu to rise aggress enough to postpon that adjust  on the other side of the adjust process we face a less favor set of choic  some combin of below trend growth and rise core inflat  as in the  book  until output is realign with potenti   the closer growth is to potenti dure this part of the adjust  the sharper will be the cumul rebound in inflat   the staff forecast    nevertheless  offer a    veri benign outcom over the next       year   the key assumpt that contribut to that benign outcom are that oil price declin over most of the forecast period and that a tighter monetari polici prevent a prematur rebound in growth to or beyond trend as long as there is upward pressur on core inflat  the result is steadi growth at a rate more than    percent higher than the averag of the    plus year prior to the mid     s  with an averag unemploy rate still close to the lowest over the last    year and still modest rate of overal inflat   this is not as good as the experi dure the bright side of the adjust process  but it would still be a pretti impress next chapter in this expans  while i appreci the uncertainti about the es  of both the short run and the long run nairu  the  book forecast and analysi highlight the risk of higher inflat that may still remain  even if the economi slip into an extend period of below trend growth
thank you  mr  chairman   over  e it has seem to me that there is a certain recur rhythm to the work of this committe   there are  e when we are face with a need to reassess the appropri fundament cours of polici and other  e when we are focus on question of how much impetus may or may not be need to move further along an establish path   and then there are occas when an intermedi term object appear to be be met  which rais a new set of issu and put us into a period when it is desir to wait and see what incom data tell us about evolv condit   we may be in such a wait and see period today  we now appear to be in an econom slowdown  which most if not all of us have been seek   and new question present themselv   how long last and how deep will this slowdown prove to be  how will the cours of inflat react   will inflat slow with the economi  continu to creep upward regardless  or perhap acceler in respons to condit previous in place   mani    scenario have a certain plausibl  but i believ the  book baselin is as good a bet as one can make today  and it call for a wait and see approach for now   i believ that repres the rhythm of the day and  therefor  that the present polici stanc remain appropri
thank you veri much   don kohn
mr  chairman  at it last two meet  the committe kept the stanc of polici unchang  but express concern that the risk go forward were tilt toward higher inflat   the inform you   ve receiv sinc august would seem to support a judgment that those risk remain contain  and that polici can again be left on hold   as a number of you remark  incom data have tend to confirm that the growth of aggreg demand has slow to  or even a bit below  the rate of growth of the economi   s potenti  moreov  develop in financi market have been consist with a project of relat moder growth go forward   while long term rate have declin on net sinc may  the full effect of the level out of equiti price this year have yet to be felt  and the dollar has continu to appreci  increas caution by lender  especi toward margin credit  should reinforc the restrain effect of the rise in interest rate over the last    month   and in part becaus equiti investor appear to have becom more cautious as well  stock price have been held down even as long term interest rate have back off   growth of m  has pick up veri recent  but that follow two month of veri sluggish expans and on averag in the third quarter m  deceler notic from earlier in the year   in credit market  lower long term interest rate have encourag a shift in financ out on the yield curv  but privat debt growth appear to have slow appreci in the third quarter   there has been less news over the intermeet period about cost and price than about econom activ  but the inform becom avail in this area has not suggest that the prevail degre of tight in labor market is a greater problem than the committe perceiv it to be in august  core pce inflat has tick higher over the last year  but some of that small price acceler like repres the passthrough effect of higher energi price   and longer term inflat expect  whether measur in secur market or through survey  have not deterior   in addit  high and volatil oil price have ad an element of uncertainti to the outlook for aggreg demand  potenti suppli  and under inflat  with possibl conflict implic for the stanc of polici   under the circumst  there would seem littl to be lost and potenti much to be gain by keep polici unchang at this meet and await clearer signal about the evolut of econom activ and price      inde  the committe might see the develop over the last intermeet period as suggest that the chanc of inflat move higher have reced  perhap by enough to bring the risk to achiev your macroeconom object into balanc for the forese futur   the financi market adopt a view that the risk were balanc some  e ago  inde  more recent  market particip would appear to be place greater odd that the committe will need to lower interest rate to cushion a soften in activ than that it will be requir to rais rate to contain emerg inflat pressur   an import reason for the committe   s percept that inflat threaten to intensifi has been a concern that the growth of demand might outpac that of potenti suppli  further tighten alreadi strain labor market   the moder in growth that alreadi has occur  howev  along with the addit restraint still in the pipelin from previous tighten  soggi equiti market  and a stronger dollar  might make you now much more confid that aggreg demand will grow no fa  than potenti output   in the staff forecast  at an unchang feder fund rate over the next year  pressur on resourc gradual abat   decreas in long term interest rate sinc this spring  along with profit warn and equiti price declin of late  tend to support the judgment express in the august  book that to a consider extent fa  product growth had alreadi been built into interest rate and expect profit   in that case  the economi would not be about to experi anoth round of the demand augment effect of greater growth in potenti suppli   if the committe therefor saw unemploy rate at or a littl over   percent as like to persist  and you also saw such rate as reason like to be consist for some  e with stabl inflat  you might now judg the risk to achiev your object as balanc   howev  even if the committe were fair confid that pressur on resourc would not intensifi  you might still find that the balanc of risk remain weight toward higher inflat   such a view is impli by the staff forecast  in which even with a gradual uptrend in the unemploy rate and further increas in product growth  labor market are tighter than can be sustain without inflat pick up   while the committe might not be prepar to sign on to this assess of labor market disequilibrium  you could still view the inflat risk around unemploy rate in the low  s as unbalanc   give some weight to histori might suggest that if nairu is not in this neighborhood  it is more like to be abov than below it  especi onc increas in product growth begin to abat   some measur of core inflat have pick up more than the pce index as unemploy rate have stay around   percent over the last year  perhap reinforc a sens of unbalanc risk around prevail level of labor resourc util   and with level of core inflat now possibl near  or even beyond  the limit that the committe might find accept in the veri long run  you might see ani    further acceler of price as advers to econom perform over  e  and a situat requir an especi robust reaction   energi price develop also might contribut to a percept that risk remain skew toward higher inflat   staff model tend to show that oil price shock push both inflat and output away from long run desir level  over recent quarter  ani tendenc for higher oil price to damp demand has not reduc actual output below potenti  howev  but rather has help to bring about better balanc between the growth of demand and potenti suppli   in the context of still robust final demand and high resourc util  ani deterior in inflat expect as a consequ of persist higher energi price would be troublesom   and in the event inflat expect rise  cushion the effect of higher oil price on labor and product market by hold nomin rate unchang and allow real rate to fall would risk set in motion an upward trend to the inflat rate  rather than just an adjust in the price level   the uncomfort realiti is that a rise in oil price requir a declin in domest real incom to valid the transfer of purchas power abroad and decreas in econom effici   some ad slack in labor market may be necessari to prevent worker attempt to protect the purchas power of their wage from result in an acceler of cost and price   keep polici unchang  whatev the bias in your announc  leav open the question of your strategi go forward   the fomc could find it difficult to tighten in a  e manner in the event that the staff is right that under inflat is on a veri gradual uptrend with output growth at or below the growth of potenti suppli   oper for a  e with a predict that inflat at a later date will be abov your desir level is not necessarili a problem  provid you act at some point to forestal or revers that develop   uncertainti about key interact in the economi is a good reason to wait   howev  with littl convict on nairu and it empir relationship to product acceler over the intermedi and longer run  it becom hard  if not imposs  to act preemptiv to prevent inflat from rise if inde labor resourc turn out to be stretch too tight   at the same  e  you need to be care not to fall into the trap of accept a gradual updrift in inflat becaus the few tenth each year could be nois and not unambigu evid that the economi is oper at too high a level  and so do not seem to pose a clear danger to satisfactori econom perform  those few tenth will cumul over  e   in the past  the committe has tend to wait for convinc evid that polici tighten was need and then to act forc  but still well befor actual inflat intensifi   this was the pattern in           and again over the last year and a half   this strategi has carri with it a number of potenti pitfal   the committe could wait too long and henc need to do consider more tighten than otherwis  lead to greater variat in output     employ  and inflat than desir   on the other end  aggress polici action onc you begin to tighten could easili lead to overshoot   despit these pitfal  the strategi has been success for a number of reason  foremost  as in      and again most recent  the committe has act at an earli stage of the inflat process  in that it lean against unsustain growth in demand long befor a pickup in inflat got go   it has also been help that market have been abl to anticip your action  so the exact  e of your tighten was not import   final  you have been flexibl enough to stop tighten and even to roll back some of the action prompt when overshoot look like   the current situat  if inflat pressur do intensifi gradual  may not be as well suit to the strategi of wait for great convict and then move forc   the risk you are now look at are further along the transmiss channel to inflat than the demand question you face befor   given the uncertainti  a number of you have remark that in the current situat you will need to be more reactiv than anticipatori when it come to judgment about the sustain of a particular level of unemploy   final  you may not get the anticipatori behavior from market you   ve benefit from in the past   at this point  market do not see the risk you see   if inflat pressur intensifi gradual  market may take longer than you would be comfort with to recogn the problem and your need to address it   the difficulti of make stabil monetari polici in the presenc of suppli side uncertainti onc growth rate risk abat do not lend themselv to readi solut   some econom theori indic you should take your best guess on some of these key valu and act on those guess  but this may not be appeal when the interact are complex and the best guess so diffus  you may still be abl to be preemptiv  albeit to a much lesser degre  for exampl by pay close attent to busi cost structur for hint that price pressur are about to emerg   and you may end up have to be more will to surpris financi market if you see pressur build and market fail to heed your warn   final  you may need to care about the level of inflat as well as it chang   the evid that a few tenth increas in inflat is part of a continu trend may not need to be quit as convinc when those tenth take core pce inflat from   to       percent as when they rais the same measur from       to       percent
question for don   if not  consid the late hour i   ll tri either to say less or to speak fa  or some combin of the two  the member    respons to the latest  book suggest to me that everybodi like the altern simul present there by the staff   the troubl is that each simul give us a    differ forecast  the staff has cover the full spectrum of forc shape the current outlook and inde has given us  i think  a fair incis view of the true rang of probabl in a situat where someth veri unusu is happen  i   m not talk about the high tech develop  which we have been discuss for quit a long period of  e   we don t know much more than we did earlier about those develop  but at least we think we are begin to understand them  the latest  book has taken the oil energi problem and has superimpos it on the high tech uncertainti  and  as a number of you have said  what we infer from that is that choos the appropri forecast is clear quit problemat  so far as i can judg  there is noth terribl signific go on in the economi exclud energi   the product number still seem to be acceler modest  but the level of actual output per hour have move into a rang where it s just not credibl that they can continu to rise and ul  reflect still higher structur product in the area where we   re alreadi see larg increas in current output per hour  even cyclic adjust   so one must be skeptic about those product number in the sens that it   s startl to see their second deriv remain posit after have been posit for so long  moreov  that second deriv has been a larger number than one would ordinarili expect   part of the problem is the flatten out of the statist discrep  which has taken the offici gdp base product data to a new high rate of growth wherea the incom base product es   specif for nonfinanci corpor  have not shown the fair pronounc chang that have occur in the offici data in the last year  the long term forecast of earn by secur analyst  as i have said befor  are not an indic of the true forecast but larg reflect what corpor america think about it futur  there is just no slow in those forecast for the longer term both for high tech and for non high tech firm  despit the fact that forecast for the short term have turn quit disappoint and    inde have fo  some realli bizarr stock price movement among some of the larger and fair well establish high tech firm   the implic is that these compani are still find project in which to invest where they anticip signific rate of return over the longer term  one   not see ani signific diminut of that earn outlook phenomenon  despit the fact that product increas have risen to fair elev level  the one thing i find somewhat of a concern here is that we are not get in ani of these view about the outlook for earn the type of impact that substanti energi price chang clear must be have   don kohn reflect on the increas cost that clear are there for busi firm despit the fact that the intens of energi usag is half what it was thirti year ago   so we clear are not look at the type of environ that we had in the past   but rememb that a good part of that veri signific declin in energi input relat to real gdp had occur by      and yet there is no doubt that the gulf war did have a signific impact on econom activ  basic  as best we can judg  through it effect on consum confid   the comment around this tabl indic that consum confid is hold up veri well  although the revis of the univers of michigan number for septemb suggest a fair sharp deterior in attitud in the second half of the month   i don   t know whether or not this is an aberr  but it s the first sign that ani of our measur of consum confid have run into troubl   if in fact that is what is happen  then the oil price energi price phenomenon is realli begin to have an impact   and inde we are begin to see some econom effect   if we separ high tech from low tech in the order figur  which is how we tend to look at these number  lo and behold low tech is do veri well  but it is do veri well becaus the surg in electr power capac problem has led to some veri substanti increas in order for engin and turbin and relat backlog that are have an impact in the economi     in ani event  i think the crucial problem here rest fundament with oil and our interpret of it role   we have seen over the year that even though we tend to refer to oil as part of the old economi  it realli is not   if we look at the extraordinari technolog advanc that have occur in the industri  they realli are quit awesom   the capabl of use seismic explor to find oil has led to a major reduct in the cost of find oil in ani given oil extract environ   the ratio of dri hole to exploratori well has come down dramat   the develop of various deep and horizont drill technolog has lower the real cost of extract oil in a quit signific way   if one mere look at the under technolog and ask what was happen to the long term margin cost of find new oil  clear one would conclud that it has been come down fair dramat as inde it has outsid the opec area  in fact  the abil of other produc to offset opec has been quit impress until veri recent  actual  until fair recent opec product was remark flat for mani year  obvious reflect a slowdown in world demand associ with the reduct in the intens of oil usag but also  surpris  a signific increas in the product of non opec oil  the difficulti that the non opec oil countri are have is that the environ in which they have to seek and drill for oil is becom increas less hospit  we may be get lower cost for ani given type of oil explor and drill environ  but if the environ is worsen one would expect  and inde one see  that a signific part of those cost improv is be countermand  so to speak   nonetheless  until veri recent the evid that the long term equilibrium price of oil was declin was realli quit impress  we have data on this  which is separ from the anecdot report of the oil compani   essenti the data show that the price trend in the futur market for oil  specif the long term or    to   year futur price of west texa intermedi  was edg downward until veri recent  two year ago  for exampl  price in    the futur market would start at     a barrel and rise to     where they would flatten out for long term contract   when spot price rose  futur price would go quit a bit higher for shorter term contract and then come down in    backward     flatten out at     or     a barrel  this behavior suggest that  to the extent that the futur market reflect the true long term margin equilibrium price  the latter was somewher in the area of     or     a barrel  west texa intermedi equival  becaus the oil industri has anoth veri import characterist  in part i might add reflect the advanc technolog that it employ  it run on veri low usabl inventori   inde  the latter might be describ as close to fume but not quit   ordinarili over the last decad or so  usabl stock of oil have suppli about    day of demand  down from earlier period   and becaus there is onli a    day suppli in the world market  we have an extraordinarili sensit oil price structur   inde  what we have seen histor is that oil price are extrem volatil and they are volatil in a veri interest way   they spike   we have had signific spike all along the way and what this suggest is a veri high inelast of respons to chang demand  as a consequ  when opec was abl in the spring of      to bring it product level down by a fair pronounc amount  they brought it down about   million barrel a day  which is a huge number  that effect began to open up a signific gap between demand  which was rise gradual  and suppli   the    day suppli of usabl stock avail at that  e start to evapor veri rapid   that stock final got down to a    day suppli and the spot price of crude  as you know  rose at a veri rapid pace   the effect was a veri dramat    backward    as they say in the market  name spot price rose to     per barrel prior to their veri recent declin   at the same  e  the equilibrium price of oil probabl did not chang veri much even though longer term futur ad    or    per barrel  larg i suspect becaus of uncertainti about the potenti    degre of excess world capac over the long term  in this situat  it was veri difficult to build inventori   with the veri substanti backward that occur whi would a refin buy crude at     a barrel and as it was be refin find out two month later that it was worth    or    a barrel less   so inventori were not be built up anywher in the system  and inde they were kept at extrem low level  therebi exagger the price acceler   final  opec was induc to rais their product quit signific  we did see the pickup in inventori that one would expect  when the gap between suppli and demand close  the declin in inventori initi slow  and stock then start to turn up  there is an interest odditi in the recent data  domest demand for oil product is acceler and product is go up veri dramat  this rais the interest question as to whether or not the domest shipment number reflect what is actual happen to demand  rememb  those number cover shipment from refineri and the primari inventori complex and do not reflect the buildup in inventori either at retail gasolin servic station or more import at home in the form of heat oil  all this is veri suggest of the probabl that under demand is not acceler but that inventori  becaus they cannot be held at the refineri level without potenti loss  are begin to increas at the tertiari level   inde  if we look at the unit state  and this is true elsewher  the demand for distil fuel has risen except rapid in the last two or three month   in fact  in comparison with a year ago  it probabl is up the equival of perhap         or         barrel abov the normal daili averag in the unit state   what this suggest is that there has been a massiv run by the american public to buy home heat oil   they are not use it yet   it is not winter   so where is it go   inventori are go up in all the secondari storag area  so  the presumpt that there is a home heat oil shortag is someth that onli peopl who don t watch the market believ   this has been the most public shortag in    recent memori  which is a guarante that it is not happen   and inde the presum shortag rais some veri interest question about the outlook for oil becaus  season adjust  we are see a veri dramat increas in aggreg world inventori accumul current   without season adjust  one ordinarili would expect world inventori to contract in the fourth quarter  and the evid at this point is that they are not   opec product has gone up over   million barrel a day  possibl even more than that  and is now much higher than it level befor the opec engin price acceler  so part of the answer to the question of what is hold oil price where they are is that capac is veri restrain   there is veri littl in the way of surplus capac in the system   leav the inventori issu asid  there is the risk of a spike that is creat major specul buy in the crude market and in the product market   and  as was mention befor  there is a veri serious concern that iraq  which is produc       to   million barrel a day  may sudden decid that they are have a product problem   if we take a chunk of crude that big out of the world system  that could do wonder to oil price becaus outsid of iraq there is just a littl more than one million barrel a day left in avail world product capac   if there are ani breakdown anywher they could creat some serious problem   but what is happen here is that level of product are high becaus the demand for inventori has surg  as reflect in both the publish primari data and in the unpublish tertiari data   the consequ has to be a real inventori bloat   it is unclear how all this is go to work out becaus the inventori problem could disappear if saddam decid that he has enough cash and  sn t need ani more money from oil sale  or we could have a varieti of breakdown  in sum  it is veri difficult to forecast the price of oil   the one thing we are pretti sure of  if histori is ani guid  is that if we get anoth spike it will revers itself provid that we can get    through this winter  get through the threat come from iraq  and hope the middl east   not go berserk   there are a lot of uncertainti in the outlook for oil that  depend on their resolut  can fundament alter the overal cours of the economi  those uncertainti have to be chang the structur of our capit stock  make it somewhat less effici   they must be creat negat that we realli don t recogn and don   t get pick up or have never been pick up by our econometr model   simul the      experi  the      experi  the gulf war experi  and i will bet that your result will not produc the recess that actual occur   what this suggest is an asymmetr impact of the oil and energi price effect   rememb  natur gas is a big problem   electr power is a big problem   so this is not a situat akin to the old environ where coal was abl to keep the cost of electr power down   we have a whole seri of problem here   we may veri readili agre that the most like forecast is the one right in the middl of the  book  it tell us that everyth will be just fine   but these market are realli veri t i and the presumpt that everyth is go to work out well is still  in my judgment  a hope  as a consequ  as far as polici is concern the general consensus around the tabl  and in my judgment the right one  is to do noth today   but the risk clear remain on the up side as far as inflat is concern larg becaus of the energi difficulti that we have discuss   even though i recogn all the argument that were made with regard to product  the nairu  and the assumpt of acceler unit labor cost  they clear reflect risk that suggest we have to be fair vigil in our assess of develop bear on the intermedi econom outlook  vice chair
i concur with your recommend  mr  chairman  to keep the fed fund at it current level and to retain the statement that the balanc of risk is on the inflat side
i can accept your recommend  mr  chairman  although i think we could go to a more balanc stanc   but we can wait
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   the argument has been well made
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   i would like to point out  though  that if we were use the old direct languag i think there would be a case for symmetri  in my view there is about equal probabl that the next move would be up or down   but the danger with tri to read that interpret into the current languag is that the market would interpret a balanc risk statement  if we were to go to that  as say that we believ the inflat pictur has becom more benign  which i do not think is the case   i think it is also worth emphas that histor oil shock have had particular event behind them  we had the suez canal closur in        we had the coalesc of opec in        the shah of iran was depos in      and there was the gulf war in           the current case   not have ani incid of that type
well  i don t think it is of the same magnitud
it had the same effect of cut opec product by a fair signific amount
well  let me comment about that   i think we have alway understood that monopoli make price high   they do not make price rise   and there is no question that in the face of strong demand it is in the interest of a monopoli to exploit a strong demand to rais price
demand was not strong   the data indic strengthen demand are veri recent   it was not strong in
no  what i   m say is that oil price bottom out in      and there has been a veri strong worldwid recoveri in the last four to six quarter   worldwid there has been an econom boom
yes  but we don t know to what extent the domest demand number  which have unquestion taken off  reflect consumpt or tertiari inventori accumul
i agre that there is an inventori cycl that is veri hard to understand   by inventori i mean the inventori that are invis and that we don t have ani direct data on   i have no quarrel with that   but i am say that i don t think it   s an accid that we have rise oil price in the context of a worldwid econom boom   that is the onli point i want to make regard my view on this matter
if saddam   someth  you ll chang your mind
that will add to our woe  no question about it

do you want to look at the announc first
i am terribl sorri  yes   i took a look at the clock and decid it was run fast   let   s look at the draft announc    paus
yes  the second page of the handout show the chang from last  e
approv by silenc it appear
it sound good
i presum that silenc indic accept  sever   yes
is pass out some materi that i will refer to in my remark   last week  you were sent two paper repres the first instal in the committe   s wide rang soma project   the other part of this broad effort  cover select criteria for altern feder reserv asset  potenti altern market instrument  and the role for the discount window  will be discuss at the next coupl fomc meet   the first paper sent last week contain forecast of the feder budget surplus go out a number of year  along with accompani expect for the contract of the stock of treasuri debt and rise in the system   s share of that dwindl stock   the second examin the recent perform of the treasuri secur market and prospect for that market  includ the system   s abil to conduct oper in treasuri secur go forward   i would now like to summar briefli our find  use the handout contain exhibit from those paper   the upper panel of your first exhibit illustr forecast of the cumul surplus in the feder budget over the come decad under differ scenario for fiscal polici and assumpt for econom growth   the three solid line illustr outcom under three fiscal scenario and the middl path for real output growth        percent per year  the board staff   s assess of structur output growth in the current year   fiscal polici a repres a current servic path  and   not allow for ani discretionari adjust of tax or spend polici to rise under surplus   fiscal polici b is base on futur congress and presid use the on budget portion to financ tax cut and spend initi  but not to touch the correspond off budget portion  an outcom that seem to have gain fair widespread support recent   the third fiscal polici  polici c  goe beyond b and allow worker to devot two percentag point of their social secur payrol tax to privat retir account   one   not need to buy into the specif of ani of these fiscal altern but rather to regard them as proxi for a rang of plausibl outcom   the paper also consid altern output path base on structur    a copi of the two staff paper  distribut to the committe on septemb    and           have been place in committe file   a copi of the exhibit use by mr  simpson dure his brief is append to this transcript    appendix       growth be a percentag point higher and a percentag point lower than the       percent middl case   the effect of these altern output path are shown in the upper and lower end of the shade portion of the chart   as you can see from the chart  the cumul surplus continu to rise under all of the possibl contempl in this studi   the bottom panel translat these surplus into paydown of market debt   under fiscal polici b and the middl path for output growth  cumul surplus reach about    trillion by       and would leav onli about      trillion of outstand market treasuri debt in that year   to get a sens of what these project impli for system oper in the treasuri secur market  we also forecast the system   s balanc sheet under the altern path for the economi   a number of factor affect the size of the system   s balanc sheet at ani point in  e  such as the behavior of reserv deposit and the treasuri   s cash balanc at the fed   but over  e the system   s balanc sheet has been driven by the demand for currenc  and we expect this to continu go forward   use our project for reserv and currenc  the top panel of your second exhibit illustr the path of system ownership of treasuri debt under the current limit on per issu hold  which amount to approxim a    percent share of market treasuri debt   under fiscal polici b and the middl output path  the system   s hold would reach that limit in about three year  and thereaft the system would need to liquid treasuri as total outstand fell  absent  of cours  an upward revis to the limit   the middl panel illustr that  under these assumpt  system hold of other asset begin to build fair rapid start in three year  and by      would account for more than    percent of system asset   these date could be brought still closer by addit dollar abroad and the payment of interest on requir reserv  which would boost our liabil and asset  thus  the  e for the system to be readi to adopt altern to treasuri secur for suppli a perman sourc of reserv to the bank system   not seem veri far off   treasuri secur have serv the system   s need  and those of a wide varieti of other holder  extrem well  given their veri high liquid and unriv safeti   moreov  the associ well develop rp market in treasuri secur has been import for temporari system transact  howev  the larg swing in the feder budget from deficit to surplus has alreadi had a notabl effect on the treasuri market  prompt various adjust by the desk   the third exhibit is intend to broad repres the perform of the treasuri secur market over recent year   it show bid ask spread quot in the interdeal market in bill  the upper panel  and coupon  the lower panel   there has been an upward drift in this measur  which suggest a general eros of liquid in virtual all sector of the treasuri debt market   over this period  some notabl disturb have sent bid ask spread soar  such as the financi market turmoil in the fall of          but these have been follow by partial recoveri  in part owe to adapt by market particip and the desk   look ahead  the kind of steadi contract in treasuri secur that we forese is like to be accompani by further eros in the depth and liquid of that market and greater volatil and vulner to shock   as note  the desk  in respons to occasion disturb in the treasuri secur market and the general deterior of liquid and depth  has taken various step to reliev pressur on the treasuri secur and rp market and to facilit it daili oper   these have includ suspend bill purchas in      and       divid coupon purchas into more tranch and spread them over week or month  broaden the pool of rp collater  and impos limit on acquisit of treasuri secur in auction and in the secondari market   prospect  we expect that in the come year the desk will be abl to continu to conduct a consider volum of oper in the treasuri secur market   over  e  though  these transact will be done at greater cost and with a greater impact on treasuri secur market  and at some point the system will need to cut back on transact in this market and begin to reli on altern   final  i have attach a list of system staff member who have particip in this portion of the overal project   thank you
question for tom   governor
tom  on exhibit    and let me stick to fiscal polici b just for the sake of simplic  in the top panel you basic work that off the budget forecast and the    percent limit to comput our treasuri hold
then in the bottom two panel you put that togeth with your es  of currenc demand to comput what other asset have to be on the balanc sheet to financ the currenc demand and make this all work   so it is a combin of your fiscal polici assumpt and your currenc assumpt  right
yes   actual  the middl panel is more of a mirror imag of the upper panel   what we have done in the upper panel is to forecast the stock of treasuri debt and also the growth in our balanc sheet  which has been driven almost main by currenc demand
okay   anyway  these two thing are go on   we have declin treasuri debt  of which we are take a share  and we have rise currenc demand   so then we have these altern asset that have to get huge in a few year   i take it what you re tell us is that we don t yet know what these altern asset are   is that for other part of the studi   that was my question   i kept look for that  laughter  and i assum that s your next instal
right   this project was broken up into sever piec   we thought the first step was to get some idea of what the treasuri market is go to look like and what kind of constraint we are go to face if we choos to continu to reli on that market in the come year  and the tough stuff is yet to come
the fun stuff is still to come
this tell you how big the anim behind door no    is   it just  sn t tell you what the anim is
i know   i think we all know it s a big anim   i just wonder whether it has stripe or spot
we re not say that yet
mr  chairman  i think this inform is veri help and certain provid a good ground for what is to come   and i am sure that is go to be extrem interest and also challeng   first  i was wonder if we know anyth about the lead  e we would have in term of be abl to look at the materi prior to discuss it   second  i    wonder whether  e would be set asid so that we can discuss this in an environ that may be slight more leisur than  say  after an fomc meet and befor lunch
well  we can replic what bill   was suggest for the decemb meet at some point   this is import enough
this is one of the more signific issu we will have to deal with
of cours the new administr and the congress may take the issu out of our hand and make it all moot
but it strike me that one question that has to be on the tabl is  do we maintain the same form of open market oper that we alway have   if you look at the size of these requir altern asset  you could buy a lot of basebal team   i know one i d like to sell you    laughter  speaker      we   re okay  thank
i don t think the peopl who are work on the altern asset part of this studi have quit taken into account basebal team
we are go to start to run out of altern
yes  i think that is right   that take me to the real point i want to rais  which is that cash is drive this   and cash not onli has an impact on our balanc sheet  it has an impact on our fiscal infrastructur as well
you mean currenc
currenc need  and so forth   are we do anyth  and mayb i should answer that question  to look at whether there are way in the futur to diminish the suppli of    cash that is necessari or reduc the growth rate of currenc   the balanc sheet need on the liabil side are driven by the increas growth in the use of cash in this countri
most of the growth is oversea
that s right
that   s right   i know it s most oversea
we don t have anyth as part of this project to look at way to diminish the growth of currenc   and i wonder as a polici issu  do we want to diminish the growth of this noninterest earn debt out there
it s at least worth look at
we have alway respond passiv to demand for currenc
the seigniorag is good
it beat tax
there is an impli tax on it
for the holder
yes  in term of all of the vault that we are build and the infrastructur that we have
it s a veri low interest rate
we spend    billion a year more or less and we get back     billion a year
well  that s right
i d rather do profit share    laughter
i think what this tell us is that this whole issu is much closer up front than i think most of us have intuit suspect   it is veri difficult to get around the fact that if the off budget item stay off budget and this actual act as a unifi budget surplus  the arithmet is awesom
mr  chairman  it is  but in a way we do have some  e to consid the right decis  particular if we are will to chang the    percent   i agre that there is a sens of urgenc but what realli come through is the import of the issu  i think
okay  ani further question   shall we go to lunch   the next meet is wednesday  novemb   th  end of meet
