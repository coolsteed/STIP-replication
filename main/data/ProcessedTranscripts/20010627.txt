mr  kos
i   ll be refer to the packag of color chart that was distribut this afternoon   u s  short term interest rate have continu to declin dure the intermeet period  reflect weaker than expect econom data and weak corpor earn report   three month cash rate fell    basi point sinc the last meet and   month forward rate declin    basi point   the   month deposit rate nine month forward  the yellow line  has also fallen by a similar amount  but it continu to impli higher interest rate for the first half of       although i should add that anecdot convers find few peopl who go along with that expect   the except is the minor of market particip who believ that a sharp recoveri will manifest itself in the second half  in the middl panel  the euro area cash rate have been stabl sinc the committe   s last meet   but the   month and   month forward rate have been pull down  as data have come in weaker for the euro area as a whole and for germani in particular  in the bottom panel are three snapshot of the japanes govern yield curv from three month out to ten year   the three snapshot date were march  st  a few week befor the chang in the bank of japan   s oper target  may   th  and june   th   at first  the bill sector was bump up against the zero axi  but now the short end of the coupon curv is also be drag down   and as we speak  all japanes govern bond matur out to three year yield    basi point or less  on the next page is an updat of a chart that you last saw at the march meet   the chart depict the shape of the yield curv at the short end in the major economi   the top panel show the   year yield less the central bank   s short term polici rate   the bottom panel show the   year swap rate less the same polici rate   i should note that the polici rate use involv slight differ matur  some central bank have an overnight rate  some a rate with a matur of as long as two week   and the top panel use the german   year note versus the ecb   s refinanc rate   the bottom panel use the euro   year swap rate   whether measur against the   year note or the swap rate  we observ fair sharp invers by year end        sinc the eas of the past few month by the central bank of the    copi of the chart are append to this transcript    appendix                unit state  the euro area  canada  the unit kingdom  and japan  the degre of invers has lessen  or in some case turn slight posit  in the last few week  though  some yield curv have reinvert or seem head in that direct  turn to the next page  the top panel depict the   year     year  and    year u s  treasuri yield sinc march  st   unlik the flat or invert short end of the curv  the coupon curv is steep   the    to    year spread has widen anoth   basi point sinc the last committe meet to about     basi point today   the middl panel show spread of    year a rate industri bond  the    year fanni mae benchmark  and the      year swap rate over treasuri   the spread  which had been narrow all year despit the strong pace of new issu and poor news from the corpor sector  have begun to widen out ever so slight in the past coupl of week  in the bottom panel  we see the same kind of pattern with respect to the merril lynch high yield index and the embi  spread   again  most of that widen has occur in the past coupl of week  now  given the larg amount of issuanc by the corpor sector  perhap it   s not surpris that the market is digest somewhat and that spread are back up a bit   an altern hypothesi suggest that a bit of risk avers might be set in  as some market particip may be have second thought about the appropri level of spread if the  e of the recoveri is be push out  the top panel of the next page has the major u s  equiti indic index to april   th  the day befor the fomc   s intermeet move   as we can see  equiti appreci sharpli in the week after that move  then went sideway for a while  but actual have fallen from their late may level by between   and    percent  as corpor earn preannounc have been larg negat  the middl panel show a similar  if more pronounc  pattern to the downsid for major foreign indic   and  in fact  today european market were down anoth   percent on averag   perhap there  too  we   re wit some sign of risk avers over the past few week  as corpor and econom forecast were be revis down   howev  if we saw pronounc risk avers  then we might also expect to see an uptick in impli volatil on equiti indic   but as the bottom panel show  the impli volatil on the s p     futur  also known as the vix index  has actual been trend lower and the absolut level is toward the lower end of it observ histor rang  turn to the next page  let me say a word on the euro dollar exchang rate   the top panel depict that rate sinc the launch of the euro in januari of        the middl panel chart the differenti between the             u s  and euro rate for   month deposit  the   year swap  and the    year swap   we observ the sharp narrow dure that  e in the euro   s favor  but i would note that the    year swap spread stop narrow in januari  just as the latest bout of euro weak reassert itself  and that spread still favor the dollar by about    basi point  the bottom panel has    and    month impli volatil of the euro dollar exchang rate for that same period   i would make two point   first  volatil have drift higher for almost the whole two year period after the euro   s launch  as the euro depreci and as most trader and analyst were certain that the euro would and should rise   second  volatil have actual been fall dure this most recent period of euro weak   the bearish view account for this chang in behavior is that the market is no longer fight euro weak and has becom comfort with the euro trade in the mid  to high   s   the bullish view is that perhap posit that need to be insur by option have been reduc   now  if the weaker long are out and henc the overhang of long euro posit has been flush out of the market  then iron that may suggest that the euro might final begin to rise    e will tell  turn to the last page and a word about reserv  the top panel graph our forecast for currenc growth for the rest of        as of the may fomc meet  we were still forecast   percent currenc growth for the remaind of       consist with the relat slow growth we saw in        sinc that meet we have adjust expect currenc growth to   percent to reflect the fa  growth observ in the most recent month and also our anticip that currenc growth may revert toward the pace that we had seen befor last year  the bottom panel show the implic of this chang for our oper   this chart is an updat version of one you saw at the last meet  outlin the expect net growth of soma  shown by the blue bar  and our total purchas of secur requir to offset redempt  if the entir need were met by outright purchas  shown by the gray bar  we at the desk expect to reli most on outright purchas to meet these reserv need  but i am a littl reluct to reli sole on outright purchas given our alreadi hefti presenc in the market   to some degre we will benefit  though veri slight  from the treasuri   s introduct of a four week treasuri bill  which is expect in mid juli or august   we plan to particip in the auction for those bill and we will also look to expand modest the long term repo book  which has been at     billion recent  let me mention two other item if i may  mr  chairman   two memo were circul to the committe last week  the first is a note regard a technic adjust to our collater pool as it relat to salli mae debt  the second memo  from don kohn and myself  provid an updat on the              work that   s be done on the soma asset studi and i   d like to make two point about that second memo   first  there is a group of peopl research the possibl of ad ginni mae debt to the list of asset that we buy  and we hope to provid an updat on that issu at the august meet of this committe   there was also a typo in the cover note that i want to correct   second  with respect to municip debt and foreign sovereign debt  as the memo indic  we have look at both possibl  the municip debt   not seem to show promis for our oper need  while the foreign sovereign debt has some potenti   we would like to explor the latter possibl further  but at the same  e  with the committe   s concurr  ceas further work on municip debt  mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to ratifi our domest oper   and i   d be happi to answer ani question
question for dino
your currenc forecast make ani explicit assumpt about currenc demand as we head toward the end of the year and the launch of the euro as the currenc in europ
not explicit   some nois may be creat so it may have some effect  but we think it   s like to be veri small  or at least that   s the assumpt embed in the forecast
well  there has been some anecdot specul that the countri that are outsid the euro area  where veri larg amount of deutschemark are held and no provis have been made for convers  may find altern in either feder reserv note or travel check or someth  at least temporarili   i   ve been told that the price of jewelri  of diamond and so forth  is realli skyrocket in europ   but the word is that larg amount of feder reserv note also are be use again
it   s possibl that we may see that effect  but it   s veri hard to measur and to forecast so we have not realli includ it in our project   sandi  do you have anyth to add
to the extent that we have seen a slowdown in the reflow of cash from abroad  it has been incorpor in the forecast   but we didn   t build in an explicit addit to growth relat to the euro   our analyst are follow the pattern of foreign currenc demand  but they haven   t ad anyth extra  in term of it escal as the year goe on  becaus we don   t realli know how much to put in
if that did happen  that would make the desk   s burden even bigger
the data i rememb see through april  i don   t know that we have shipment data through may  from sever larg bank that special in this kind of activ did not show ani pickup in net shipment to ani of these countri   we look specif for that  now it   s veri earli befor the launch of the euro currenc  and the anecdot stori are alreadi start   nevertheless  we couldn   t realli see ani evid of that in the shipment data
well  the anecdot were all over the place by april and may   so the fact that the shipment didn   t in fact increas would suggest that the anecdot report are a littl exagger
on page    in the panel show the vix index  as i understand it there   s some season in that index  or at least i heard some market commentari to that effect  do you have ani idea what is normal for the summer   it   s usual lower in the summer  as i understand it   second  is that just a    day volatil   if so  it  sn   t look veri far into the futur
that   s right   i   m not familiar with the season characterist of this index  but the pattern we have seen is that it tend to run between the low   s  perhap the high teen  and the low   s   so on an absolut level  it   s fair low  and i think it   s interest to note that the trend has been head downward   i don   t want to make too much of it  but if one were think that risk avers was set in  one might point to this as an indic go the other way
yes  i understood that was the reason you put it in there   but my question had to do with it normal season pattern   so befor we reach a conclus about what that index suggest  i think we better know what the usual season is   i don   t know the answer to that
again  there may be some season there   i don   t know that it   s so pronounc that it would affect the index in a meaning way
i don   t know one way or the other either   okay  thank you
further question for dino   i assum there are no object to his request to go forward in the manner he describ relev to municip and foreign issu   if i hear none  i assum that it   s perfect fine
mr  chairman  i move approv of the domest oper
without object  they are approv   we now go to a seri of veri interest studi on the issu of product   dan  will you be start it off
yes   thank you  mr  chairman    in respons to the wish of the committe for a discuss of product develop  the staff will be present three brief this afternoon   sandi struckmey and i will discuss the staff   s view on structur product and potenti output     fuhrer will present the perspect of the feder reserv bank of boston  and   steindel will discuss the product slowdown of the              late     s and earli     s   we will be refer to the materi label    staff brief on product develop      the perform of the u s  economi in the second half of the     s was noth short of remark   one of the key factor drive this econom resurg was the substanti acceler in labor product  follow near a quarter centuri of sluggish growth   as can be seen in the upper left panel of chart    the averag growth rate of labor product pick up from     percent in the period from the earli     s through      to     percent sinc then   as seen at the right  the growth rate of labor product has tend to rise sinc       although more recent it has drop back as the economi has slow and as a retrench has taken hold in the tech sector  this brief review what we know about the caus of the resurg in the second half of the     s and  given the most recent develop  assess how much of that pickup is like to persist  as highlight by the bullet in the lower panel  we first explor the sourc of the pickup  examin how much result from more rapid capit accumul and how much from a quicken of the pace of technolog progress   we focus particular on the role play by inform technolog   to assess the sourc of the pickup  we use a tradit growth account framework  reli primarili on the multifactor product data produc by the bls   follow that discuss  we then turn to the question of how much of the recent product growth is cyclic and how much is structur   final  given today   s econom situat  we discuss the outlook for structur labor product and potenti output  the upper panel of chart   lay out a simplifi version of the standard neoclass growth account framework that we use  a framework that was develop by robert solow and edward denison in the     s and     s   as shown in equat    where dot over variabl indic growth rate  this approach express growth in output  design q  as a weight averag of the growth rate of the input   the two input includ in the equat are capit servic  label k  and labor hour  shown as l    in this express  the growth rate of each input is multipli by it incom share  denot by s for the incom share of capit and    s  for labor   s share   the portion of output growth not attribut to growth in input is the multifactor product residu  label mfp   it also has been call total factor product   it is a catch all for technolog or organiz improv that increas output for a given amount of input  equat   decompos growth in labor product  label lp    in this decomposit  growth in labor product reflect increas in the amount of capit per hour work  refer to as capit deepen  and mfp   copi of this materi are append to this transcript    appendix                 growth   in our empir implement of these equat  we also includ a term that account for chang in labor composit  that is  for the effect of chang in the experi  gender  and educ attain of the workforc   factor that might affect labor product  befor get to the number  the lower panel lay out some of the key strength and weak of the growth account framework   one strength of the growth account approach is that it is base on the microeconom theori of the firm  appli to the overal economi   in addit  the approach is straightforward and intuit  repres output growth as a simpl weight averag of the growth of input   and  it is a rich approach that can help to identifi the sourc of growth in a period of structur chang  a weak of the growth account approach is that it requir sever strong assumpt about how the economi function   for exampl  the approach assum that market are competit and alway in equilibrium   in addit  as typic implement  the growth account approach assum that capit becom product as soon as it is instal   this assumpt seem reason for some type of asset  such as person comput  but probabl is not reason for certain type of complex infrastructur  such as communic network  where element put in place now may not be brought on line for a number of year   also  a full implement of this framework impos heavi data requir  rais the possibl of measur error   final  this approach ignor the cost of adjust capit stock   for small chang  this assumpt probabl   not matter much  but suppli shock that induc signific chang in product technolog or relat price  such as larg energi price shock  may caus the model to go off track   despit these limit  this framework has been a mainstay of growth analysi for mani year  reflect the widespread view that it generat number that are sensibl  our empir implement of growth account is the subject of your next chart   we start with the multifactor product data set put togeth by the bls  focus on the nonfarm busi sector   the output measur  which is base on the nation incom and product account  is real gdp in the nonfarm busi sector  and the measur of labor hour is base on the seri for hour of all person publish by the bls   for capit  bls use the concept of capit servic  which i will describ in a minut   as indic in the second bullet  the bls use these measur of output  capit  labor  and labor composit to calcul mfp as a residu use a growth account framework similar to equat    current  bls has publish mfp onli through        to extend these data to       we use publish inform on output and hour  and we construct a figur for capit servic use publish data on invest  becaus we translat invest to capit servic at a higher level of              aggreg than will the bls when they es  mfp for       there is an extra element of uncertainti surround our number for        to generat quarter number that can tie into our  book forecast  we then interpol the bls annual number for output  hour  capit servic  and labor composit   from these number  we calcul quarter es  of mfp growth  the middl panel describ the capit servic concept use by the bls  growth in capit servic  denot by kt  is a weight averag of the growth in individu capit stock   these individu stock are denot kit  where the subscript i index the differ type of capit   the weight for each asset  the    w   s  reflect the margin product  or relat effici  of a particular asset   the weight differ primarili becaus of differ in the use live of each asset   for exampl  a unit of comput capit has a short use life and like will be scrap after onli a few year   becaus the cost of the comput is amort over a veri short period of  e  it has a high margin product and get a high weight   in effect  the servic flow from a unit of this capit must be larg enough to cover the cost of rapid obsolesc   in contrast  a unit of offic build capit  which has quit a long use life  generat a smaller servic flow in a year and get a smaller weight becaus the cost of the asset can be amort over mani year  use the growth account framework and the data i just describ  the lower panel decompos the growth of actual labor product growth for select period   the decomposit shown is quit similar to that report in a seri of research paper  includ work by   olin and myself and by dale jorgenson and kevin stiroh   the first two column compar the period of relat sluggish product growth from      to      to the resurg period from      to       the third column show the acceler between the two period   as can be seen on line    the rate of increas in actual labor product rose from     percent per year to     percent per year  an acceler of     percentag point   this pickup reflect larger contribut from capit deepen  line     which step up     percentag point per year   mfp growth  line    account for the rest of the pickup   by these number  capit deepen account for a bit less than half of the pickup in labor product growth  becaus of our interest in inform technolog  we extend the system to split the capit deepen term into the portion relat to it capit   includ comput hardwar  softwar  and communic equip  and to all other busi capit   and  we also split mfp growth into the portion come from the product of comput and relat semiconductor and the portion come from all other sector   to do this  we use inform on relat price and share of these high tech product to es  the mfp contribut relat to their product               as can be seen by compar line   and    greater use of it equip and softwar more than account for the rise in capit deepen  moreov  mfp growth aris from the product of comput and the semiconductor that go into them  line    account for a notic chunk of the step up in mfp growth  even though these sector repres a small share of total output   taken togeth  the use of it  repres by the it capit deepen number on line    and the mfp gain associ with the product of it  shown on line    account for   percentag point of the     percentag point resurg in labor product growth in the second half of the     s  some analyst  most notabl robert gordon  have argu that the pickup in mfp growth was concentr in the product of it  and  inde  those sector made a sizabl contribut to the step up in mfp growth   howev  as line   indic  the sector outsid of the product of it contribut     percentag point more to mfp growth in the second part of the decad than in the first   although some portion of this pickup like was cyclic  these number indic that this broader sector of the economi also enjoy a resurg of actual mfp growth from      to       sandi struckmey will now continu our present
dan has describ the data that we use in our analysi of the suppli side of the economi   i will outlin our method for es  the rate of growth of structur product and potenti output  refer to the top of chart    the start point for our analysi is the simpl observ that the growth of labor product is procycl   labor product typic rise rapid dure the recoveri phase of the busi cycl  slow down in the expans phase  and declin dure recess  for mani purpos in econom analysi  it is essenti to abstract from these short run swing and focus instead on the under rate of increas in product   for exampl  firm may base their price decis on    normal    unit cost that correct for short run cyclic variat in product  or household may base their consumpt on their percept of their perman incom  which arguabl reflect their view of the long run growth in their real incom and henc the trend in product  thus  for our medium  to long run analysi  we defin structur product growth as the compon of product growth that can be sustain over a complet busi cycl   it has also been call    trend    product growth or    cyclic adjust    product growth by other research   it determin are the same as those dan describ except that es  are made of the structur contribut of each of it compon    with one import except   we do not distinguish between actual and structur growth in capit servic   although busi invest clear fluctuat over the busi cycl  in our view the actual path for invest                  and henc the actual growth in individu industri capit stock and servic    best captur the resourc avail to produc good and servic at ani point in  e   we also do not adjust for chang in the workweek of capit in our measur of the growth of capit servic   such an adjust could be made for manufactur industri  but it would be much more problemat in the trade and servic sector  given these assumpt  the critic part of our analysi is the es  of structur mfp   initi es  of structur mfp growth are generat use sever econometr model   these es  are refin use other inform about technolog develop and suppli shock  such as increas in energi price  that influenc the choic of product technolog   the black line in the middl panel of the chart show actual mfp growth   if all of the recent pickup were judg to be perman  this seri might be view as an upper bound on structur mfp growth   the staff   s es  of structur mfp growth is shown in red   begin in       it move up in discret step to a     percent growth rate in the post        period  we put togeth the piec of structur product growth in the tabl in the lower panel   as you can see on line    structur product grew slowli over the      to      period but acceler mark after       reach     percent last year by our es    a signific part of this step up can be attribut to the boom in invest spend over that period that substanti rais the contribut from capit deepen  line      but the rise in structur mfp  shown on line    also is an import part of the stori  your next chart present our es  of potenti output growth over histori and our project through        by our definit  potenti output is the level of real gdp that could be produc with exist plant and equip when the unemploy rate is equal to the nairu   potenti output growth is es  as the sum of potenti labor hour and structur labor product   as shown on line   through    the primari determin of potenti labor hour is growth in the civilian popul   howev  it also incorpor shift over  e in labor forc particip  the employ rate  and the averag workweek   for exampl  the increas in labor forc particip over the      to      period is es  to have boost potenti output growth by almost    percentag point per year  but this was partial offset by a lessen in the averag number of hour work each week  line      movement in the nairu also affect our es  of potenti output growth through the potenti employ rate shown on line    a declin in the nairu increas the quantiti of labor employ at full employ  rais the potenti employ rate   by our es   the declin in the nairu over the      to      period contribut an extra     percentag point per year  on averag  to the growth of potenti output over that period               our forecast for potenti output growth is shown on the right hand side of the tabl   we project potenti real gdp to increas     percent in      and       much more slowli than in recent year  owe to less rapid growth in structur labor product  line    and potenti labor hour  line      the anticip slowdown in the growth of potenti labor hour reflect the updrift in the staff   s es  of the nairu  line      which push down the potenti employ rate  line    in both year  the contribut from capit deepen to structur product growth  shown on line    also is expect to drop back  given our  book forecast of a declin in busi invest this year and onli modest growth in        as you will recal  we began link our es  of capit deepen to the project  book path for invest last summer   we felt that such a direct link would help to ensur consist between our es  of the suppli side of the economi and our outlook for invest  at the  e  dave   predict that this would make our forecast for potenti output growth much more variabl than in the past  certain one of dave   s best forecast of the past year    laughter   but  given the wide fluctuat in capit spend sinc earli       we believ this approach has help us to better monitor and better understand suppli side develop and their implic for our forecast of econom activ and inflat in contrast to the smaller contribut from capit deepen  we expect structur mfp  line     to continu to grow at the       percent pace that we es  has prevail sinc        despit the econom weak this year  busi report are proceed with plan to use inform technolog to streamlin the way they deal with their custom and supplier   a recent survey of plan research and develop expenditur also suggest that mfp growth will remain strong   as shown in the lower left panel  the battell institut report that r d expenditur will increas anoth       percent in real term in       after growth of         percent  per year from      to        this find is consist with statement from mani high tech firm that  despit cutback in other part of their budget  spend for r d is key to their long run financi success and will not be scale back the lower right panel of the chart illustr one possibl stress test of our es  of structur product growth and potenti output      s law       s law has proven to be one of the most reliabl method for forecast the unemploy rate   use our es  of the nairu and potenti output  we es  a version of     s law  specifi in level  through      and then perform a dynam  out of sampl simul from      through the first quarter of        if our es  of potenti output growth are too high  we would expect     s law to over predict the               unemploy rate  convers  if we are too pessimist about potenti  the model will underpredict   as you can see  with our es  of potenti output growth      s law track the movement in the unemploy rate fair close over this period   this give us some confid that our es  are not too far off the mark    fuhrer will now continu the present
i   d like to begin by thank don kohn and sandi struckmey for invit the boston fed to give it perhap aberr view on product develop  i   d also like to start off by emphas that i am a product op ist   i believ that the creation  adopt  and adapt of new technolog over the past twenti year has increas the effici with which the economi produc a wide varieti of good and servic  as you know  this process  while inher a surg in the level of product  is ongo and gradual  and has thus been manifest in a notabl rise in the averag growth rate of product   the process continu today  i am op ist not just about the past  but about the futur growth of product  i want to take a minut today to rais a few question  in particular  quantit  how much op  is warrant  and with how much precis can we quantifi it   second  how much weight should we put on the most recent observ in es  trend product growth   and final  how much more difficult   the strong complementar of comput hardwar and softwar make our attempt to measur the capit servic that deriv from them  to anticip my answer to these question  i believ that      statist  it is difficult to justifi long run product growth much in excess of     percent or so      how much weight to put on the most recent observ is larg a matter of judgment  not statist  and     the interact between comput hardwar and softwar make infer about capit servic especi difficult and subject to more than the normal degre of uncertainti  which is larg to begin with  to put my card on the tabl  i es  that we current enjoy a     percent trend rate of product growth and will like continu at a rate near that for the next   to    year   reassur  as of the june  book  the board staff and i have converg on the same near term es    my basi for this long run assess is that network and telecommun technolog are still evolv  and their improv  adapt  and gradual adopt will like add to product over the next decad   my es  of current and near term product growth is deriv  as is the               board staff   s  from a varieti of techniqu includ direct trend es   infer from     s law relationship  and growth account   all of these involv a good measur of judgment  to begin  i   d like to take a veri simpl look at aggreg product data   turn to the next page of our brief materi  the top panel of figur   display the distribut of quarter product growth rate over the past   year   i chose this period becaus mani have date the shift in product growth to earli       and i will provid evid corrobor that date in a moment   what do i see in this simpl pictur  first  there are onli    quarter number in this plot   that is not much data from which to infer a trend shift   as a necessari consequ  we cannot say with much certainti whether a shift has occur  and if so  how larg the shift is   again  i believ a shift upward to about     percent growth has occur   but i could not rule out the board staff   s earlier  more op ist es   nor could i rule out the possibl that recent product surg will prove larg transitori  the second observ to make from the figur is that the    quarter fall more than   to   in growth rate below     percent   the averag growth rate dure the period is about     percent  turn to the bottom panel of figur    it is not the case that higher growth rate tend to be clu  in the more recent year or that lower growth rate are clu  in the earli portion of the sampl   this panel use the same color code by growth rang as the upper panel  from slow growth  dark blue  to rapid  red    as the lower panel indic  slow and moder rapid growth rate are fair even distribut across the six year   this  e distribut of growth rate suggest that  while the averag growth rate has like shift up  the basi for an ongo acceler in product is not as immedi evid  nonetheless  the three highest growth rate in this period occur relat recent  in the third and fourth quarter of      and the second quarter of        as a result  the rate of product growth for the four quarter end in the  nd quarter of      was an astonish     percent   if evid of further acceler is to be found  it is in the fair short and recent period from mid      through mid       more formal statist test for product trend shift confirm the insight from this simpl analysi   figur   present result of test for a shift in the product trend allow for multipl unknown breakpoint  this test look for breakpoint over a given sampl while remain complet agnost about the locat of the breakpoint   it   s import to note that  owe to restrict from statist theori  this procedur   not allow               breakpoint too frequent  say everi two or three year  or break too close to the begin or end of the sampl   but i think that   s actual a good thing  determin frequent or recent break in trend is a matter for judgment  not statist  the actual quarter growth in nonfarm busi product is shown in the gray bar in the figur   the red line depict the es  trend product growth rate for the sub period defin by the breakpoint  the figur suggest the follow  the simplest test  shown in the top panel  find a shift in trend product growth in earli        the es  growth rate from      to      is     percent  in the middl panel  i add to the breakpoint test regressor that attempt to control for    cyclic    effect on product growth  rapid  unmeasur increas in labor effort dure spurt of high demand  for exampl   while these cyclic effect are inde signific in explain some of the quarter fluctuat in product  they do not materi alter the es  of the recent trend growth rate from the top panel  in the bottom panel  the growth in capit servic per hour  the    capit deepen    variabl of choic  is ad to the test regress   the addit of this variabl virtual elimin ani recent shift in trend product   that is  after control for capit deepen  averag product growth sinc the mid     s is rough equal to the averag for the dozen year befor that  this last result suggest that multifactor product growth  which account for the bulk of labor product after exclud the effect of capit deepen  has grown at a healthi pace over the past decad or more    about a percentag point fa  than in the dismal      s and earli      s  howev  this method provid littl evid of a more recent increas in trend multifactor product growth   sustain increas in product must ul  be support by multifactor product growth  that is  by technolog progress   with steadi technolog progress  we can continu add new machin that embodi the latest technolog without suffer diminish return   i believ that this process of embodi technolog driven invest was at the heart of the capit deepen in the late     s and may well drive addit capit deepen when we recov from the current slowdown   but onc again  an acceler in product which aris from an increas in the rate of growth of multifactor product is hard to justifi use this methodolog  in discuss figur    i note that the evid for a more rapid increas in product growth lie in a few key observ between mid                     and mid        this lead natur to the question  in assess chang in product growth  how much weight should one put on the recent past   as i suggest  this is larg a matter of judgment  not statist or econom theori   your next chart  figur    display the evolut of the board staff   s es  of structur product growth over the past six year   as the chart indic  as recent as mid       the board staff had es  structur product growth  shown in the black dot line  at below   percent  which look quit pessimist by today   s standard   to be sure  some of this pessim aros from the less robust growth evid in the unrevis  real  e data shown in the light gray line  as of septemb       the board es  trend growth for       the bold red line at the right  at     percent   from that point  their es  rose dramat  increas almost     percentag point in less than    month  echo actual product perform in      and earli       sinc august of       the board   s forecast for structur product growth for      has fallen almost     percentag point  just as actual product growth has slow   in the interest of full disclosur  i should note that i was probabl too slow to revis my es  of product growth upward   in may of      i es  structur product growth at     percent  in june of      my es  was at      percent  and onli by septemb of      had i rais my es  to     percent  where it stand now  of cours  the board staff   s rise and fall es  aris through the link between the staff   s invest forecast and it comput of capit servic per hour   rapid invest impli larger net addit to the capit stock  a larger flow of capit servic from that stock  and more capit servic per hour   while this methodolog has a sound theoret basi  our judgment is that it has produc larg and rapid swing in structur product that may stretch mani peopl   s notion of    structur     i offer two reason for smooth through some of these recent burst of product  first  it is conceiv that much of the invest in           was y k  relat comput invest  or just generic over invest  that didn   t deliv much in the way of addit capit servic   second  we think it like that a good portion of both the unusu high product number and the veri recent lower one reflect unmeasur variat in effort  rather than chang in under product   not all hour of work yield the same effect input   it is like that worker can increas effort per hour for short period of  e when demand is high   these unmeasur chang in the intens of effort may have allow temporari  unsustain increas in output without structur product increas  final  i   d like to rais a conceptu question about how well our product account system captur the joint contribut of comput equip and softwar to capit servic per worker   in essenc  my concern boil down to the possibl that we may have over adjust               comput price for qualiti improv  thus over es  their contribut to real output and product   no doubt the rapid declin in hardwar price approxim the increas processor speed and storag capac of new comput model   howev  it may not be the case that these increas in hardwar capabl accur reflect the increas function provid to busi by the combin hardwar softwar bundl  hardwar often advanc just enough to make it possibl to run the latest softwar   here i have in mind  for exampl  the    killer app    refer in the staff memo on capit overhang  killer applic that requir new hardwar to run them   as a result  the servic deliv by the bundl of hardwar and softwar are not like to equal the sum of the independ comput servic flow for hardwar and softwar   in addit  this interdepend of the develop of new softwar and hardwar is a key determin of the effect rate of hardwar obsolesc   this is a signific departur from standard assumpt about capit depreci   these complex serious tax our standard method for track the addit to capit servic of the hardwar softwar bundl   i am not suggest an eleg altern to our current method  although i believ this will be an import area for futur research   but i do wish to point out that this fundament complex conceptu problem add to the uncertainti surround our es  of capit servic and  henc  of structur product growth  in sum  our near term es  of trend product growth is     percent  the same as the board   s current es   although we have some  differ in the past and may in the futur   the long run prognosi for product growth is also good  becaus it appear that the growth in multifactor product has

thank you   i   d also like to thank don and sandi for give me the opportun to speak today   it seem my job is to talk about a less op ist period of product perform  as we all know  product growth in the nonfarm busi sector was notic slower from      to      than in earlier or later period   the transit to slower product growth appear to have been gradual   labor               product growth in the year from      through      was low by the standard of the postwar period   there was a resurg in          but      saw a drop to the lower number that becam customari through the mid     s   tabl   show measur of product for various subperiod sinc        we can see that the downshift in product growth after      through      was widespread across sector   nonfinanci corpor product growth move in line with the total  though manufactur product remain rather strong  develop in various multifactor product measur in the late     s and earli     s were similar to those in labor product   chart    on the next page  show the annual es  of multifactor product growth for nonfarm busi made by the bureau of labor statist   there were sever year of negat multifactor growth in the late     s and a veri brief         reviv   from our vantag point today  the slowdown in multifactor product growth in the year in the late      s appear to be a good indic that the basic product trend was begin to falter   howev  as dan note earlier  such es  of mutifactor product depend veri heavili on detail  definit data that simpli were not avail at that  e  contemporari observ were well awar of the sluggish in product in the late     s  especi in        nonetheless  there appar was a widespread belief that product growth would rebound to the trend of the     s and earli     s   tabl   pull statement from report of the council of econom advis from      through        they continu assert that the longer term trend in product growth was         to   percent   the transit from the  son to the nixon administr onli seem to make a differ in the boilerpl languag or where the discuss of product was place in the report  the number were general the same  of cours  the inabl to detect the shift in the product trend was like compound by the except turbul of the late     s and earli     s   just to remind everybodi  major event includ   the vietnam war  larg swing in feder tax  substanti expans of feder regul and entitl program  the collaps of the bretton wood system of fix exchang rate and gold price  a period of widespread wage and price control  the first oil shock  and sharp shift in monetari polici   given the disrupt of the day  it is not surpris that low product growth was often dismiss as reflect short term disrupt  in       for exampl  a shortag of skill worker often was mention as imped product    rather than the begin of a more disturb long term trend  there were a number of develop in the late     s and earli     s  potenti observ at the  e  which could have suggest that the product trend was weaken   first  product growth was weak on a               number of occas  given the overal state of the economi   chart   show the result of a number of roll regress i ran of product growth on output growth   these regress were es  year by year over sampl end in the late     s  the regress were move forward everi year    extrapol forward a further year and see how the forecast compar with actual product   the forecast line is shown in red and the actual product chang  q  to q   is shown in blue   while the error were most rather modest  we see repeat case where the project product growth was greater than actual growth in the late     s  and the shortfal in      was rather larg   howev  as we all know  such regress are subject to normal sampl error of some magnitud   in ani event  these regress were back on track from      to       profit trend and equiti market develop provid some further evid that product growth was deterior in the late     s and earli     s   as chart   show  current dollar profit of nonfinanci corpor drop substanti as a share of sector output in this period  at the  e  one might have attribut the declin in the profit share to some of the special forc then at work  besid of cours the recess in       the upward trend in nomin interest rate  increas pension cost  increas payrol tax  intensifi foreign competit  and the surg in import commod price   the recoveri in the profit share in the expans of the mid  and late     s   suggest that there were some unusu short term factor  again  asid from the cyclic declin  hold profit down around        howev  the longer term signal provid by the profit slump appear to have been reinforc by the stock market   s perform  chart   show the earn price ratio and various measur of real interest rate   the earn price ratio  in black  was littl chang on balanc after the mid     s befor begin a prolong uptrend in       the blue dash line is the real fund rate  measur as the nomin rate less the four quarter chang in the core pce price index   real interest rate appear to have peak around      and drift down for a few year in the late     s  but they were then quit volatil through the earli     s befor bottom out in the middl of that decad   the real    year rate  shown in red and comput on a compar basi  behav similar  the impress  therefor  is that real rate may have peak around the mid     s and perhap start trend down   this impress is reinforc by the board staff   s calcul of the equilibrium real rate  which show a pronounc declin from the mid     s through the mid     s   but that measur of the real rate  which is base on current es  of the output gap  was not observ at that  e   the relat between the earn price ratio and real interest rate depend on percept about the riski of the stock market and expect of earn growth   the rise in the earn price ratio relat to real rate in the late     s  as a matter of logic  suggest               that investor either were regard the stock market as an increas riski invest or were revis downward their es  of futur corpor earn   either adjust would appear to be consist with reduc es  of the longer term product trend  in conclus  the experi of the late     s and earli     s suggest that product trend can inde chang rather unexpect  and it show  the difficulti of detect such a trend shift while it is occur    use our knowledg of subsequ develop  comparison of observ product to that predict by overal activ as well as observ of profit and the stock market would seem to have provid evid  avail at the  e  that the deterior of the product trend was under way in the late     s   howev  an observ of the day  familiar with the long record of a strong product growth trend  may well have overlook those signal   in sum  the experi of thirti year ago show us how hard it is to detect in real  e that the product trend is shift and by how much  that conclud our present  mr  chairman
that was extraordinarili effect  gentlemen   i think you ought to be pleas that you coordin so well  let me rais a few question myself   you   ve all rais basic conceptu problem and i think the major concern that you express relat to the fact that the input data are not adjust for intens of use in one form or anoth   you   re work off the capit stock and you   re use depreci as an import compon of the weight use to aggreg capit stock to get at capit servic   you   re all  howev  use gross product in constant dollar as measur by bea   yet as we all know  the statist discrep underw a veri dramat widen over a protract period and did not revers   as a result  real gross incom grew signific fa  than real gross product dure the period when product growth was acceler   mani of the conclus that come out of this analysi are affect by use product side data rather than incom side figur   we know that gross domest incom and gross domest product are conceptu ident  so we   re deal strict with measur question   more import  the weight of the argument is that while the data are possibl margin superior on the product               side  that superior is inde margin   therefor  robust conclus on issu of this natur  at least in my judgment  should be those that come out of data from both the incom and product side and are effect independ of the type of measur use  even if we get beyond that question  there is also the problem of which we are all awar  name that implicit in the gross product  and in fact in the gross incom  data are some structur issu   in particular  there are industri product es  or cross classif of industri  such as corpor versus noncorpor  which when you squeez the data effect produc veri signific numer howl  if i may coin an aw metaphor   our analysi indic  as   that of other  actual declin in real output per hour over the past few decad in signific area of the economi  such as health servic  legal servic  and repair servic  howev  the gross product origin data in nomin term in all of these area are not particular out of line  suggest that we are inde look at some veri import bias in the price indic   of cours  the crucial question here is not whether there are bias but whether the bias are chang   and of that we   re not terribl certain  the cross classif by legal form of organ suggest that the locus of the measur problem is the noncorpor sector   so  if we look at product in the nonfinanci corpor sector  the growth rate shift we see from the pre      to the post      period is actual signific less than for the nonfarm busi sector   let   s look at some of the averag   for exampl  let   s take      to l     which is a strong product era  and compar it to the           period   as you can see on the tabl shown by   steindel  the declin in nonfinanci corpor product between those two period was a lot smaller than it was for nonfarm busi   inde  the same is true for manufactur   the obvious infer from those data  which  as i indic  has been confirm  is that when we disaggreg the               data  the number for the noncorpor sector behav in an entir noncred way   therein lie the crux of the whole problem and where a number of question aris with respect to the robust of some of the result present to us today  in my judgment  it might be use to rerun this whole exercis use incom side data and perhap substitut for some of the unreli price measur we have in our system   for exampl  as we all know  when peopl analyz select segment of the medic servic area  everi studi almost invari show a long term deflat of unit medic cost   when we use aggreg price measur  those cost go up   inde  if one tri to infer the movement in the averag price from the nomin gross output per dollar origin in medic servic  one get a price declin   so  a lot of basic data adjust are call for  in order to make consist the intern data system we   re work with   i think we ought to make those adjust and then run through this kind of exercis in order to determin whether or not the result are a function of the data input we are employ   some of them will be  some of them won   t be   but befor we can stretch our state of knowledg terribl far  i think it   s use to know what raw materi we have to put in our system   for exampl  i suspect that if we spent a good deal more  e on the capit input data  we   d come up with a lot more problem than you   re rais     or that dan is rais as well  the ul  question  howev  realli boil down to how these system work in forecast real gdp   the truth of the matter is that they do pretti well   so you   re conclud in a sens that the system is not just nois but that there   s someth there   now  the aggreg size of a lot of these inter relationship probabl didn   t make terribl much differ on the way up becaus they were all go in the same direct   they do matter signific at turn point or when we   re tri to look at the longer term   so as i see it  there has been extraordinari               progress in the number system  but some of it make me a littl uneasi  especi that chart  which  regrett i think  design how we project structur product  book by  book   it ought to be classifi    top secret  one eye onli      it  sn   t do well for us   i   m not sure that our retrospect view is anywher near what that set of number show   anyway  i   ve said my piec
mr  chairman  may i respond
by all mean
i have a coupl of comment   i person like     s last chart   and rather than view this as a vice of the staff   s approach  we think it is a virtu   i   d point to the     s law chart  which is my last exhibit  chart     when we   ve use this approach over the last year or so  we realli haven   t been off too far in our forecast of the unemploy rate   inde  if we use a gross domest incom concept in     s law  es  in a veri similar way to the way we   ve done potenti output on the product side      s law fit about the same as shown in this chart   we haven   t done that recent  but when we   ve done it in the past  the two method haven   t diverg great   they may diverg at turn point  as you suggest  that   s someth we haven   t look at but we can do so   at ani rate  we think this method has serv us in pretti good stead over the last year in help us to understand what realli has been go on in the economi and in keep our inflat and output forecast on track with those develop
sandi  let me just ask you this   i vagu recal that we use to employ     s law to es  potenti   if you start in that direct and work backward  it   s go to generat this particular relationship
well  it is an iter process    laughter
i appreci your
mr  chairman  let me add one thing on the incom side number   in addit to the materi we present  we have done this analysi use the gross domest incom data   i can tell you what that would produc for chart    which show that labor product growth pick up from     percent in the earlier         period to     percent in           period  for a pickup of     percentag point   if we rerun that use gross domest incom  the pickup would be about     percentag point more   so  as the chairman said  there may be some prefer for the product side but it wouldn   t be that strong   if one went to the incom side  there would be a bit more of a pickup in multifactor product to explain   inde  the council of econom advis in the way that they do these decomposit in their analysi will typic averag the incom side and the product side in look at the number  take a veri agnost view as to which is more correct
mr  chairman  may i make one comment about     s pictur as well   what   hint at in his remark  but it  sn   t actual show in the chart  is that the techniqu that he use  and inde that we use ourselv befor last summer  were techniqu that in a period of improv product are go to result in a seri of persist one side error   that is in fact what we were observ in our own forecast for a consider period of  e   so it didn   t seem to us to be a reason approach to take as a baselin  given that it almost certain would result in that kind of pattern   we recogn  as sandi said  when we shift to our current approach  that by tie our potenti output forecast much more close to our invest forecast we were go to creat a seri that would move around a great deal   i don   t take the up and down movement in our es  that we   ve seen thus far over the last year necessarili as a defeat of the basic approach   while prove more variabl  like our forecast  it               may turn out to be less bias than an approach that look simpli at a linear filter of product perform   so i think the juri is still out  obvious  we felt in some sens that it was veri difficult to present a forecast to the fomc  e after  e in which an invest forecast impli someth about the pace of capit deepen but we then divorc that forecast from our es  of structur product  that was the concern that led us in the direct of tri to tie those concept closer togeth  what has happen  obvious  is that our invest forecast has been off by a ton over the past year   we move to this techniqu probabl just at the  e of our peak forecast of invest and have been revis it down sinc then   so i think   is entir fair to present this chart becaus it inde reflect our record   on the other hand  i don   t think it necessarili requir us to put an    eye onli    over it and never show it to anybodi   in fact  i feel quit comfort explain it and defend this pattern of error to the committe or to peopl outsid the committe as well
well  mayb the problem is that we   re use the term    product    to explain all of this but what you   re explain is the use of a structur model to forecast certain intern variabl that are the determin of the level of output in the relat short run   the word one use to explain it probabl are not realli relev   in fact  it   s quit conceiv that what you   re do is realli quit differ from what   is do  that the two of you are measur differ thing   he presum has a definit of what he mean by structur product   inde  that   s obvious the case if we listen to what he   s do and how he   s calcul it   but you and he are not measur the same phenomenon   you   re measur a differ phenomenon   it   s almost as though he has a    year move averag and you have a   year move averag and you   re struggl to find out whi they don   t look the same
i think we recogn that
there is some of that
also  the kind of question one might want to address with these various analys are differ   i rememb presid   ask earli on in this process about whether we would use this for a    year forecast   we indic    no     becaus we   re think in some sens about a higher frequenc notion of what is structur   we tri to adjust our languag to reflect that by use differ terminolog  talk not about our view of trend product but our view of structur product   and in the longer term simul that we present to the committe  that es  of structur product vari over  e  depend on the longer term outlook for capit invest or the relat price of capit equip
i might add parenthet that we often show negat number for multifactor product   if we truli mean that as knowledg or some form of technic capabl  the presumpt that we forget the wheel or some particular major advanc somehow just  sn   t seem
but that number is not just knowledg   it   s knowledg plus error and cyclic behavior  too
well  even if you cyclic adjust it  you can still get negat number   i would call it error plus knowledg rather than the other way around
at some risk  mayb when the chairman speak for me  i should just keep my mouth shut and leav well enough alon  i just want to tri to clarifi one point   and that is that i don   t think we   re actual as far differ in our concept of what product is as you might be suggest   i would not as an oper matter use simpl long run linear trend to figur out structur product   in fact  the reason i believ that product growth               acceler over  e is precis becaus we had sustain burst of invest that actual did add capit servic becaus those servic embodi new technolog   so that concept  i think  is absolut right   the question is onli about short period  when we imput product surg that are structur becaus of invest burst that may not deliv capit servic in the way that the model say they would   then there   s some scope for appli judgment to adjust those es   and i   m appli judgment a littl differ from the way the board staff is as well  but i don   t think we   re quit so differ in term of our notion of structur product
let me rais one final question  which realli get to the issu of capit stock   our capit stock number are heavili influenc by decis about what spend should be capit and what should be expens or written off   secur analyst appar believ that write off item increas the market valu of a firm   what in the world do we mean by capit stock other than that which produc incom in the futur or  by extens  product in the futur   therefor  those write off are an issu becaus given the way that we tabul capit deepen  we are effect elimin from the capit stock a number of item that are written off   brynjolfsson  for exampl  has some huge number that he appli to the capit stock on the ground that these item are not written off concurr and thus do add to the valu of the firm at a later date   to be sure  that capit will depreci fast  averag depreci rate will be a lot fa    nonetheless  if the capit stock is grow and we never quit catch up  we will get a shift between multifactor product and capit deepen   obvious labor product will be invari in relat to that   but again  it   matter for project purpos   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  i   d like to offer a coupl of comment and then end with a quick question   i like these paper veri much   i thought they were quit help                for me at least  the bottom line is that the confid interv around ani current es  or project of structur product growth is fair wide   i can   t say that the paper have actual narrow it ani   still  it   s veri use to me to have a sens of how some of these number are construct  and i appreci the work  i might just say  though  that i think it   s worth keep in mind that this is the first in presum a seri of discuss of special topic   these are in some sens a substitut for the discuss we use to have on the money target   onc we began to deemphas the money target  we usual got into some discuss of the longer term strategi of monetari polici at these so call    humphrey hawkin    meet   in my judgment that   s a tradit we ought to keep   in that spirit  i think it   s appropri to tri to draw out of this discuss as best we can the implic of product growth prospect for our longer run monetari polici strategi   we should determin the connect between the product growth trend and monetari polici as clear as we can  now  with respect to our monetari polici strategi  we no longer set explicit money suppli target and we have not as yet adopt ani definit substitut for that   but given our public commit to long term price stabil  i think most of us have some implicit target ceil for inflat that we carri around in the back of our mind  at least i do  and it   s probabl someth like   percent on the core pce   so it seem to me that the key question here for the committe is   what are the implic of chang trend product growth rate for achiev and maintain long term price stabil   actual  it   s interest that from a longer term perspect if we   re target inflat  even if it   s an implicit target  in a sens trend product growth  sn   t matter becaus ani trend product growth or ani sustain long term rate of econom growth is consist with price stabil               knowledg of trend product growth is veri import  to me at least and i think to mani peopl  in term of give us an es  rang for the equilibrium real fund rate at ani point in  e  given whatev situat we face   we   ve talk about this mani  e befor   the higher the product growth rate  and henc the fa  the expect growth of futur incom  the more busi and household are go to borrow money to tri to bring some of that expect higher futur incom forward  and henc the higher the equilibrium real rate need to be to make peopl and busi firm be patient and wait until the actual higher incom aris   the staff has been produc es  of equilibrium real interest rate to be use in formul our short term monetari polici set   i think that has been use  and that bring me to my question   i   d be interest in the staff    s es  of how much the rang of equilibrium real rate has to chang in respons to a particular increas in trend product growth   to be more specif  do you have es  over the long run of how much the rang of equilibrium real rate need to rise when trend product growth increas by  say  a percentag point   that seem to me one of the basic practic question that we need to answer to help us in conduct monetari polici
in some of the paper you   ve receiv over the year  and in the bluebook this  e  i think there are some hint of that   the model   s es  of the effect of trend product growth on r   the real feder fund rate  are more than one for one becaus of the big effect on demand   the suppli effect on equiti price  on expect incom  and expect earn have a signific impact on demand for consumpt and invest   so in the model  unless it   s chang of late  a   percentag point increas in trend product growth give us an r  that is about     or     percentag point higher  and obvious vice versa for a reduct in product growth   this is reflect to a certain extent in chart   and   of the               bluebook   those chart simul higher and lower product growth   they don   t extend long enough in  e to give us a true trend   but if you look  for exampl  at the surg in structur labor product chart  the real fund rate level out at         percent in    the perfect foresight     case  the dot red line   the differ between these is about       percentag point  i guess  but it  sn   t go to equilibrium   but you can see there that even in a few year the perfect foresight model take the real rate up to about       percent wherea the product slump case has the rate at about   percent  and i think it would continu to come down   that   s not as much as the   point chang  but it give you some sens of what   s go on   a product chang certain   feed through into effect on r
in think about   fuhrer   s chart with the high variabl structur product  i believ we can make good sens of that if we go back to the growth account equat on chart     in my view the problem here is that we have tend to proceed by think about a potenti gdp track  which involv labor forc growth  take account of the demograph  and some structur labor product trend   we then add the two togeth   but that can   t realli be divorc from the invest outlook  which is the point of the growth account equat   that equat say that product  look at the decomposit of the growth of output  is tie in  to the invest outlook   that is even more true today than it was in the past becaus of the relat short durat of so much of the new capit   so our idea of potenti  which come from ad togeth trend divorc from the invest outlook  is realli mislead   to me that is the point of emphas this concept  and i think that point is absolut right   now  we may not like attach the word    structur    to it becaus               it seem to chang too fast  but link it to the invest outlook i think is absolut correct  so what that say about the amount of output that the economi can produc  which is obvious relev for monetari polici  and about the amount of inflationari pressur that might result given the polici that we follow  is that it realli is tie veri close to the invest outlook  as for the multifactor product  that   s not just inform or the accumul of knowledg   it also includ the effect of regulatori chang that may damag product  such as law that affect the entrepreneuri environ   all sort of public polici are go to show up in multifactor product  which certain can be negat   i   m sure mani of us believ  for exampl  that at  e lawyer have damag the product of the societi
that   s whi i question all of these declin output per hour figur that are implicit in the decomposit of data for medic servic and busi servic origin in the gross nation product   but i   m equivoc on the issu of legal servic    laughter
one of the issu for those who tri to studi product on a sector by  sector basi lie in the difficulti of identifi input and output sector by sector   i think denison   s posit was that one has to go to an aggreg level rather than to tri to specifi product sector by sector  the latter end up be a lose game becaus of the difficulti of relat one sector to anoth
well  that   s onli partial true becaus staff here address that question with input output analysi and found that mani of the measur anomali are in industri that primarili sell to final user   i note earlier  for exampl  that one of the problem industri is health servic  but the bulk of the output of that industri goe to               final user   so  conceptu denison is correct   but as a practic measur structur  the way you go about it  when you disaggreg the data  that realli tell you someth
what i   m get at is the problem of take aggreg product and assign it to sector   for exampl  bob gordon has argu that it is veri difficult to sort out the product of the airlin from that of the aircraft manufactur becaus chang in the qualiti of the aircraft affect both   tri to distinguish how much of that is aircraft
that argument is accur when one is look at the contribut to the total product   but we do learn thing about output per hour within sector becaus profit within a sector   rest on it   whether or not the product in aircraft manufactur give us lower input price for aircraft servic is an interest notion   but it still  sn   t give us the check that this disaggreg provid   that   s becaus if we get the number in our measur of sector product  irrespect of what   s go on elsewher  that make no sens intern relat to profit margin within that same sector  for exampl  that is tell us that price is veri peculiar measur
right  it   s tell us that the measur of output and input are strang
no  actual i think that is a differ issu than we   re discuss here about the accuraci of the data
well  let me make one other point   i think that perhap what we need from this analysi is a sens of the standard error in this process   how much uncertainti do we face   is there some kind of trend or standard invest outlook that would help us to separ out this uncertainti about the capit accumul   then the question would be   given some standard invest outlook  what is the standard error for the labor product   what is the rang of uncertainti   i want to ensur that we   re not confound our uncertainti about the               capit accumul process with the uncertainti about the output that come from a given amount of capit
i think that is a veri good suggest   one would want to know not onli the standard error of the invest capit accumul but it covari with the multifactor product as well
i have no idea   no doubt that is a veri difficult thing to do  but i m tri to distinguish the separ aspect of this problem
mr  chairman  i d like to ask the author to comment about the paper that we all receiv by   fernald of the chicago feder reserv bank   it seem to me that the inclus of adjust cost is theoret a justifi inclus   in term of that paper  it certain result in a decid more op ist view of structur product go forward   i would like to hear your view regard fernald   s es  and also their implic   i must admit that dan sichel   s comment  when he indic that in your approach you ignor the cost of adjust capit stock  is somewhat unsatisfi to me   i would appreci your comment on the paper by fernald
let me start   inde  the standard growth account approach  sn t take account of adjust cost   the usual argument for that and whi it evolv that way is that origin the approach was use for look at growth over veri long period  look at one twenti year segment compar to anoth twenti year segment   and over such long period of  e it s presum a reason assumpt to say that the economi within that period converg to an equilibrium and ani adjust cost have worn off   when one take the analysi to a higher frequenc and start to look at develop year by year  then inde the               possibl that adjust cost would matter more becom more import   certain in period like the earli      s and the late      s there were larg adjust cost associ with the oil price shock that the standard approach  sn t deal with well   accord  the standard approach was not terribl use for understand those period  as for the fernald paper  i found that paper veri provoc   i think  as you said  that theoret it make sens to consid adjust cost  and the framework in fernald   s paper seem to be the right one   i believ he did the best job anyon can do in an effort to es  how larg those adjust cost are   but it is a veri challeng task to pars out how much is adjust cost    when a firm is adjust it capit stock it is difficult to determin how much  involv an adjust to it desir stock today as compar with how much involv build a telecom infrastructur  say  that is put in place today but won t becom product for a long  e   that     e to build    phenomenon  or the lag between the invest and when the actual product impact is felt  can be difficult to separ from the adjust cost   so  i think that paper   the best job that can be done  but the task is veri challeng
well  when you think about how we use structur product growth in term of polici  it involv a shorter  efram   and the assumpt that i think we are make  that the adjust cost is zero  probabl is not an op  assumpt
mr  chairman  i   m prompt by your unkind remark about lawyer to note that it was suggest that the juri is still out on these issu   if your initi remark are meant to be the charg to the juri  that juri is go to be out for a long  e    laughter                 steindel mention and i think in his present made clear that when a major shift in product is take place  it   s veri easi not to spot it at the  e   that  i believ  make it import that we applaud what the board s staff was do  even though it gave rise to that interest  look chart   while the staff was struggl with that issu  it was veri clear to the committe that someth was happen that we were have difficulti explain and we were search for an explan   and sinc this is not an econom class but rather a central bank tri to make monetari polici  it s crucial that we know when we   re not sure of someth becaus then the judgment factor in make monetari polici becom even more import   if you had been give us the impress that you realli understood these product issu more than you actual did at the  e  then i think we would have been less awar of the need for judgment   so i veri much applaud what you did   i thought the present was excel and the work  especi bring to our attent when you are less certain than you frequent are  is an import part of help us make polici
presid  n
i m interest in the follow issu   it s my impress that we have not seen this acceler in trend or structur product in ani other larg industri economi  at least so far   if that s true  i think that   s potenti import becaus that would suggest that someth uniqu is happen in the unit state   i m certain inclin to believ that the u s  economi is on a new and more favor product track and i would becom even more convinc if i understood whi other economi have not join in that progress   so the question is   have you look at that issu and if so  what can you tell me about it
may i refer you to a bulletin articl last octob in which member  of the board   s intern financ divis research that question on other industri               countri   they came to the conclus that there was no convinc evid of acceler product growth in other countri   they offer some conjectur  i hesit to call them explan
yes  i rememb the conclus and sever of those conjectur as well   i guess my question realli is   subsequ to the public of that articl  do we know anyth more that we can say about it
the author of that articl continu to updat their databas and we look to them for addit work on product   but they have not in ani sens reach firmer conclus
i have a work hypothesi that is essenti veri easi to come up with  gari   and that is if multifactor product depend veri much on the use of inform technolog in order to make older industri be more effici  the singl most competit advantag a countri can have  which the unit state has  is a flexibl labor forc
yes  that s part of my explan  too   but rather than reli on my own intuit  i was hope that we had some more hard and fast evid of what either has or hasn t been go on
yes  but i think it s realli a combin of econom and sociolog  sinc what we   re observ is a societi as well as the pure econom of the situat
yes  we do know that it is far more difficult to discharg worker in europ than it is here   that s a legal question  wholli demonstr  and it show up in european unemploy rate   if a signific amount of capit invest is labor               displac and a firm is not abl to displac labor  then the rate of return on the capit  of necess  is less   henc the inclin to invest is less   therefor  as you would expect  and inde as has been the case  the degre of high tech invest in europ is much smaller than in our countri   and if  as we look at the data breakout we   re examin  either the applic of technolog or it product is a crucial part of the product acceler  one would assum that the labor rigid issu is all we need to know to explain the differ   that is  i think  the reason you have in mind
gari  could i jump in on this point   i went through the articl to which   was refer  and i think ideal what one would like to have is a chart like dan   s chart   for all the other countri  a chart that just set out the decomposit of product growth   but as i rememb  we can t get a bls type breakdown of the capit stock for other countri   isn t that right   i think the unit state is uniqu in permit analyst to do that  so in a way  until there is much more disaggreg data in these other countri  this issu is go to have to remain in the domain of specul
it is certain true that it is a struggl to get data to work with  even someth as basic as hour as oppos to number of employe   in the studi our staff use an approach involv a set of oecd countri  and they use oecd data   so the weakest link  if you will  is to find the data   it s certain possibl that if we focus our attent on one or two countri that produc data that they don t all have  we could make some great progress in tri to see what is go on   but we continu to work on this problem
i would like to tri to draw out from these veri interest discuss some implic for the near term forecast   i want to focus on area where the two approach                  we ll call them the staff approach and the boston approach  agre and disagre   i take it that the agreement is that current structur product growth is around       percent and that that repres an elev level from the earli     s to mid     s   the question is   do you agre on the implic for the outlook    that reflect an ongo pace of innov that is like to rekindl the appetit for invest and support some op  go forward about your assumpt regard high tech invest   is that fair to say
now where you disagre  i take it  is whether or not we believ this structur product growth overshot in some sens and is now revers   the question is  how   that matter in your two vision   let me describ how i think the staff is look at it  particular if equiti valu and invest respond sharpli to the drive forc behind the product movement  that is  the chang in the pace of innov and so forth that motiv invest and give rise to op  about earn   it seem to me that the staff view it this way   that if the economi adjust relat rapid to that  then that give us support for explain whi the economi was as strong as it was earlier   and the revers has import implic for the near term outlook   do you want to reject that or
i would be somewhat hesit to draw veri tight link between anybodi s specif es  of structur product and what the stock market did or didn t do at ani point in  e   i think a qualit link is there in that  yes  we in boston believ that structur product has increas for the reason you just enumer and that at some level it   s sensibl for the stock market to price that in   i have no disagr with that   we are onli disagre about how much  whether some of these develop were transitori  and whether               the stock market should have seen through them  and so on   that s a matter for an academ debat   but there are line of your stori that i would certain agre with
mr     pleas proceed    secretari   s note  the chairman had left the room briefli and the vice chairman was recogn the next speaker
let me add just one comment to that   with our more variabl es   we think that some downward adjust to structur product growth probabl has occur over the past year and that that has had an effect of lower the equilibrium real feder fund rate   for all the reason that   laid out about our uncertainti and the confid interv around mani of these es   i certain don t want to lean too heavili on that reed  but it is a piec of our analysi
i have a question for sandi struckmey on the treatment of capit deepen   you make no attempt to separ out cyclic from structur chang in the case you present   you indic that you don t do so becaus it s not use in some sens  not that you don t do it becaus it s too difficult or you don t know how to do it   but take the case of perman incom growth   couldn   t you argu that household  if they realli had perfect foresight  should look through blip and overshoot in structur product due to this kind of overshoot in capit deepen becaus it isn t go to be sustain   and  therefor  if you were realli tri to get it right  you would smooth these variat and end up with someth that was more stabl
there are two part to that   the first is the invest part  and we think we ve done that correct   that   s becaus for a concept of potenti output or structur product  we do not want the capit stock that might have been in place had we               never had a busi cycl over the postwar period   that would be such a departur from realiti that it realli would not help us to deal with the concept involv   the adjust for the workweek of capit is an issu that we want to studi   we recogn that in principl it would be better if we could adjust for it  but it s veri difficult to do so   we have a capac util rate that presum could be use as a proxi for the manufactur sector   but outsid of manufactur  it is difficult to know how hour work per week are chang   util of capit in a lawyer s offic  for exampl  is veri  veri difficult to come to grip with   we could take a crack at it  and we will pursu that idea   but i person am not op ist that that is necessarili go to be a critic refin to our measur of capit servic that will signific chang the pattern that we see in the final result
thank you   let me make a coupl of observ and then pose a differ type of question about the intern dimens of this   first  on the observ   i think it is veri use to have these kind of paper and discuss such as this in light of our relat ignor on the subject of product   when i look at a  e seri that we label    product    and reflect on what we know or think we know about output and the other input that produc a result such as this  i wonder what i am suppos to think about it from a policymak   s standpoint   but  for exampl  when i look at     s chart   and that spike in      and      and the subsequ declin in      and       i recal that a number of thing were go on at the  e that i   ve alway thought confound ani analysi of that period   in      it was report at the  e  i don t know what the subsequ revis show  that real output suppos rose   percent that year and the gdp deflat rose   percent   the gdp deflat rose onli   percent becaus that s what presid nixon   s wage price control program               permit   then in the subsequ year the control program came off and the price index rose   percent or so  and the effect was that output plung   i ve alway felt that we ought to averag those year togeth if we were tri to draw ani conclus becaus the data as report certain were affect by the on again off again aspect of price control   meanwhil  as that was go on  we had the oil price shock of               i ve alway believ that those shock were better thought of as real wealth loss   they repres a chang in intern term of trade  we move to a lower product possibl boundari   we all rememb the stori about    s be ground  and it had noth to do with how new those aircraft were   they were econom obsolet given the input price  their econom life was shorten dramat quit irrespect of their physic life and their account life   so we got a plung in output in            i also rememb the mothbal aluminum smelter around           those facil were brand new but they weren   t viabl ani more  given the level of gas price   i mention that now  of cours  becaus we   ve had volatil in energi price and we ve had some other rather odd develop   the state of california by itself is the world s fourth or fifth largest economi and it is    percent of our economi   if it were to continu the same energi polici and produc no output or a declin in output  except for suggest that it should seced and not distort our data  i don t know what i should think about that situat in term of product   we haven t lost technolog   we haven t becom dumber or anyth like that  it s just that the state has an incompet governor   so if you have ani observ about that  i   d like to hear them  on the intern side  as i read these paper  it was easi for me to fall into think about our economi as a close economi   but i do know  and you mention invest  that we have some veri larg corpor that invest across the border  in canada and mexico and               even in taiwan   and i don t know what to think about the pace at which they re transfer knowledg and technolog and how that feed back into our economi   so to make my question simpl  suppos all innov  all breakthrough in technolog or creativ or knowledg    occur in the unit state and that the onli way other countri acquir a new product or knowledg was through our transfer it   how would that come back into our economi  as an increas in our wealth that would somehow show up in a  e seri of product
were there such an innov  my supposit is that we would get a major increas in the rate of return on capit   we would see that reflect in greater profit  a larger flow of capit incom  and that would be reflect in the capit deepen number that would then boost structur product   and over  e that would spread to other countri as we export those product and as we reloc factori abroad becaus of relat wage differenti
so if we are import the final product  partial analysi would say that that s go to enter negat in our gdp number
but we are also get capit incom   if you are intel and your product facil is locat in taiwan  there is a reflow of incom from that capit
unless in the  e period i m look at the exchang translat effect of that are swamp that reflow of incom   becaus we have the innov go on here  our wealth increas  capit flow in  our currenc rise  and we get a lower rate of return at least for that  e period on our foreign capit invest
there would also be a posit price shock that would be exact the revers of the oil shock of the      s becaus we d be get import more cheapli
if our measur is right and we get the j curv effect
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  found this discuss veri interest   obvious  i talk with   fuhrer about these issu beforehand  but the combin of all three paper and the chicago paper was quit interest   i want to reiter what bob parri said about the adjust cost becaus i think that is a fascin topic and it s not dissimilar to an issu that   rais at the end of his present   what do we know about how softwar and hardwar work togeth and when that realli becom effect   one of your under assumpt is that capit is product immedi   that may or may not be the case  particular when we re look at short run chang or even two  or three year chang  one question i had relat to the period of the spike in the es  of structur product growth  when we were go through what one might realli call a    shock    in term of invest spend associ with y k   one could arguabl say that a lot of the invest spend  or at least some portion of it  involv replac equip and softwar that was alreadi in place   the new invest would not do anyth differ but would function in a way that wasn t go to go awri onc the calendar chang   and some of the invest involv brand new item that were also y k compliant   over that period of  e  pent up demand was also a factor in invest spend  particular in the first quarter of       when after everyth work out fine firm could find comput expert  they couldn   t find a comput person six month befor  and final get someth done and buy equip and so forth   has anybodi tri to sort out the impact of y k relat factor from those big invest number   do we have ani idea what that    shock effect    was
y k is a veri complex phenomenon to analyz   it is particular complic for the capit servic measur becaus there are two part to that               measur   on the one hand  there s the capit stock itself and there are also weight  rental price or effici weight  that get attach to those various item   inde  one would expect to see the phenomenon you talk about with respect to the capit stock  as firm replac older equip that probabl was not as effici as the new equip that replac it   on the other hand  the flow of capit incom that all of this is benchmark to through the rental price  in the way the bls calcul it  was reduc  i would assert    by y k and the remedi effort associ with it   peopl spent lot and lot of  e and money and probabl reduc profit relat to where they would have been had there been no y k effect   and in the process that pull down the rental price in the weight  which can either fulli offset or more than offset the posit benefit obtain from replac old equip with new equip   so i don t think it s a foregon conclus  just becaus old equip was replac with new equip  that in this set it necessarili was an enhanc to product   when we total up all the piec  i think the y k effect probabl was a negat  although that is extrem difficult to show empir
that was the thrust of my question
we came up with a number of     billion for what it cost corpor to remedi their y k concern in term of labor and consult   that number didn t includ the capit   so that would have been taken out of their flow of capit incom and would have been reduc profit and hold down that rental price measur   we don t have a full account for all these factor   i don t think it s clear that y k necessarili boost capit deepen as measur in this system
that was the reason for my question   i was wonder if we might actual see a level off from the product growth number here  as a result of the negat impact of y k
may i follow up on that   that answer suggest to me that the way you think about that event is similar to the way some view the      s  when we had enorm capit expenditur  mandat expenditur  on clean air and clean water  but they were not output enhanc capit expenditur   some peopl at least assert that the declin in trend product growth at that  e occur becaus we were produc someth  i e  cleaner air    or more precis  not produc dirti air and dirti water  but the associ capit spend didn t add to what got sold in the marketplac
the way bls construct these number  they are part of the capit stock from the product side obvious  but there is also a flow of capit incom from the incom side   to the extent that those pollut abat expenditur produc no profit but actual reduc profit  then that would have been a compens factor in the bls number   it would alreadi be in these data  so you would not have to make a separ adjust for it
further question   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to congratul the author of the paper   i thought they were all veri good and i believ it was an excel idea to have this as a topic for our session today   i just want to make a coupl of comment about the so call    organiz  improv    portion of multifactor product   the paper defin multifactor product as a catchal for technolog or organiz improv   we often talk about the technolog side but we rare talk about the organiz side  at least in this forum   have spent some  e in privat industri  i think the organiz side is               extrem import   i know that some research studi have been done on this  but i would encourag us to do more work in that area   also  the analysi that we   ve done  go back five or six year now  at the chicago fed about the resurg in the midwest economi show that it was due larg to the reengin and restructur of firm  in part relat to inform technolog but by no mean sole   a lot of it just result from better manag  figur out how to get thing done in a more effici way  also  i think the term    multifactor product    is a veri difficult one for a non economist to understand   i   ve had convers about this topic with lay peopl a number of  e and i person think that the term    innov    is a better character of what we   re talk about here   again  i   m use innov in a broad sens  not just in term of technolog but innov in manag and other area as well   i simpli want to make that comment becaus i found that terminolog help  at least in my convers with non economist
may i make just a brief comment   there   s a veri interest paper by eric brynjolfsson and loren hitt in last fall   s journal of econom perspect that provid some veri nice evid on the import of organiz improv   also  on the adjust cost point that presid parri and   mention  i didn   t mean to suggest that a zero adjust is appropri just becaus we do it that way   that is onli a baselin   it   s a veri simpl  transpar framework that peopl understand   i think  as you suggest  that adjust cost are a veri import issu  and the work that   fernald did is an import first step in think about that   it is someth that i think we need to continu to focus on  henc  the reason i mention it as one of the weak of the approach as we implement it
i have a question that   s relev to the measur of output and capit  i   ve seen a lot of stori about compani that invest in equip  last year  let   s say    that didn   t work out and they are write that equip off at ten cent on the dollar or someth like that this year   the equip is includ in last year   s output at     cent on the dollar becaus that   s when it was produc   what happen to it this year when it get written off   how is it treat in the capit stock figur   and how   it affect the nation output figur this year
that   s a complex question   i   ll tackl a piec of it   the equip got into output when it was produc  it get into the capit stock  as measur by the bls  when a compani purchas it   to the extent that it ever yield a profit  that get into the incom flow from the corpor sector that we will see this year and in all subsequ year  had it paid off the way peopl thought it would  it would have produc a flow of capit servic greater than what you   re actual go to see in the data when they   re final publish becaus basic it   ll be in the capit stock   but if it   s written off  it is yield zero capit servic or it may even be caus loss to the firm  which would be pull down
but it isn   t written off   it   s basic just not produc profit   the point that presid pool is make is that it   s a problem of abus the concept of gross product origin data  use that rather than net data and then have that item of capit destruct in the depreci account   mayb we ought to add to it someth  say  econom destruct
yes  econom obsolesc
but the way it is treat in the capit stock data that you use is that it would be accumul  sort of a perpetu inventori but depreci at whatev is the normal depreci rate
it actual end up as lower multifactor product or  excus me  innov
but i gather that the reason for the sharp drop in product this year might have to do in part with the fact that compani are write off capit  at least some of this capit is equip  fa  than the depreci assumpt you have built in   so there   s capit in your capit stock figur that compani in fact aren   t use   is that right
so that will show up as reduc product from capit
but that capit has been sold and purchas at a lower price and is yield a veri good yield for those compani that bought it
well  it depend on the natur of the capit   those compani might be get a yield on it that   s worth    cent on the dollar  but it   s be carri as if it   s worth a lot more than    cent on the dollar in the capit stock data that the staff is use
well  i think that   s absolut right   what you   re think of is what actual appear on the book of the compani   the properti account ad up from the ir return will produc a differ set of number from the capit stock we use becaus the former   includ write off   nation incom account don   t pick that up
but the point of the question is that some of what we call output last year   and it enter our data as     cent on the dollar  in fact hasn   t turn out to be use becaus it is be written off this year to    cent on the dollar   so in truth we produc less last year than we thought becaus part of what we produc turn out to be junk
we should have call it consumpt last year
or wast or someth   that   s my point   some of this huge spike in measur product is perhap a consequ of overst output last year  but some of that is show up this year   that   s the way the data system work   is that right
just on this point  you alreadi write comput softwar off in a four year period  don   t you   it has a veri rapid depreci
three to five year  depend on the type of softwar
so the point is true  but it   s not go to be with us veri long
no  that   s right   but what i   m focus on is tri to understand the most recent data and how that bear on our outlook right now   that   s what i was get at with my question
but  bill  isn   t part of your point that no capit servic is be gain from this invest and that   s whi it end up look as though there   s realli no product improv   that   s becaus there   s no servic that get paid off from this invest
or it   s    cent on the dollar  right
it   s creat an expens
so it   s realli a problem of servic be generat as oppos to the account concept  which is the definit of servic here
and it also underes  the multifactor product number becaus that   s pick up in the residu   so it can distort the project   ani other comment or question
i   d like to go back to gari  n   s question about other countri and focus on europ   i realiz most of this is about structur product rather than total product   what about the idea of    give growth a chanc      dure our period of rapid increas product monetari polici was fair easi   we were probabl get readi to tighten and then the east asian crisi came along and we didn   t tighten   and then the russian situat came along and we actual eas a bit   as i recal  dure most of this period europ was move toward the euro and tri to get the maastricht condit settl  so their monetari polici were all rather tight   then they start tri to improv their credibl   is it possibl that part of the answer is that monetari polici in europ has been too tight  particular recent    that polici has just not given enough room for their economi to grow
i think that would be say that they are misjudg  as it were  how much growth they could in fact experi and still not get inflationari pressur
i was think that in some sens we accident found out what our economi was capabl of do
that is true   i certain  and mani other  have challeng our european counterpart not to be held hostag to the number from the past and to be open to the concept that their economi could grow more rapid and not encount inflationari outcom that would be unaccept at some point   then along came the oil price increas and the               weak in the euro  so that perhap has cloud the opportun for them to realiz that their economi actual could grow fa  use inform technolog even if they use it less complet and less success than the unit state   so in some sens the juri is still out   if it turn out that europ experi some acceler in it growth five or six year later than this countri did  part of it will probabl be the result of the  e issu   but it   s certain not the case that observ inflat is surpris lower anywher in europ   so the european have not reach a point where they believ in the capabl of their own economi to grow more rapid without inflat
okay  whi don   t we take a coffe break   let   s tri to keep it to ten minut if we can   coffe break
given the avail of these color chart and staff advisor  it appear that we have a chart show come up   mr
thank you  mr  chairman   if the vice chairman found the last present a refresh admiss of ignor  wait until he hear this chart show     laughter  as you know from read the  book  we continu to believ that the economi is bare grow at present   real gdp  the black line in the upper left panel of your first chart  has deceler sharpli from it rapid pace of earli       that slowdown has been amplifi by a substanti inventori correct  but the growth of real final sale  the red line  also has move down mark  on net  in recent quarter   we have receiv two import piec of inform sinc the forecast was complet last wednesday  intern trade figur for april and  this morn  a read on new order and shipment of capit good in may  the implic of these data for our forecast are shown at the right   revis in the trade data point to even weaker growth of real gdp in the first quarter  about     percent at an annual rate instead of the     percent we show in the  book  this morn   s figur on order and shipment were in line with our expect and leav our es  of growth in the current quarter at about   percent   for the year as whole  we now expect real gdp to increas     percent  just a touch lower than in the  book forecast     copi of the chart show materi are append to this transcript    appendix                 with the growth of real output project to run well below the growth of potenti into next year  the unemploy rate is expect to rise from it current level of       percent to about       percent next year  overal pce inflat  the black line at the right  is expect to drop from the       percent rate post last year to about       percent in       that deceler larg reflect our anticip that consum energi price will be fall notic in come quarter   core price inflat  the red line  basic move sideway at just under a   percent rate   the deceler of structur product in the staff project  discuss by sandi and dan  is a sourc of upward pressur on price inflat over the project interv   but the indirect effect of fall energi price and the emerg of slack in labor and product market are expect to keep a lid on core inflat through       clear  the extent of the weak in the economi has come as a surpris to most forecast   as seen at the lower left  the blue chip panel has mark down it forecast for real gdp growth in      by about a percentag point sinc januari  while make onli a margin adjust to their outlook for        our forecast    the lower right panel  alreadi was well below the consensus in januari  but we too have revis down a bit further our project for growth of real output this year  like the blue chip  we have revis up our forecast for inflat this year  but have not chang our outlook for       your next exhibit highlight the two relat influenc that have most shape the veri rocki econom perform that we have experienc sinc late last year    inventori and capit good   earlier this year  we had expect the sharp cutback in product that began last fall to have larg elimin most inventori overhang by earli summer   as you can see in the upper two panel  that has not happen   inventori sale ratio for high technolog product  the left panel  have soar in recent month  and those in the non tech sector  the right panel  have  on net  edg up further   firm in the aggreg have been liquid stock sinc about the turn of the year   but virtual all of that liquid has come in the non tech sector   for tech product  inventori accumul appear to have crest this spring  but the bulk of the liquid phase for that sector still lie ahead  the collaps in invest has certain weigh on final demand and contribut to inventori problem   as seen in the middl left panel  order and shipment of comput and communic equip have plummet in recent month   and the outlook for invest in other equip  shown to the right    has deterior as well   revis data now indic that order have been run well below shipment sinc the turn of the year  impli order backlog have been drawn down   all in all  it   s a veri weak pictur  as a result  we now anticip that industri product will fall sharpli through the third quarter  and recoveri will onli take hold earli next year as               inventori are clear out and demand begin to firm   in the technolog equip sector  the lower left panel  product is expect to declin into the autumn  comput and semiconductor should turn up befor the end of this year  but communic equip is not expect to post ani gain until        outsid of technolog and motor vehicl  we are expect deep cut in product to continu through the summer befor output reach bottom toward year end   the subsequ recoveri that we are project for next year is a weak one by histor standard  your next chart highlight a few sector that have  thus far  prevent the weak in capit spend and industri product from tip us into outright recess   light vehicl sale  shown in the upper left panel  have held up veri well   and report for earli june suggest that the sale pace has not yet slacken appreci   to some extent  automak have been hold up sale through the use of more generous incent   even with some further sweeten of incent  we expect the deceler of incom and the weaken of household wealth to result in some drop off in come quarter   as seen to the right  prompt and aggress cut in product succeed earlier this year in curb motor vehicl inventori  but if our sale forecast is correct  further cut will be necessari in the second half  hous start  the middl left panel  also have been well maintain this year  low mortgag interest rate have larg offset negat incom and wealth effect  and we are project residenti construct activ to be littl chang over the remaind of the year  consum spend  shown in the panel at the right  has surpris us to the upsid   still  after a jump earli in the year  real spend has been on a shallow trajectori than was the case over the past few year   moreov  we think that the slower pace of spend would have been even more notic by the second half of the year absent the effect of the tax cut  the blue line in the chart  while i hate to throw cold water on even these few warm spot in the economi  it is worth point out that these sector are not like to provid much upward momentum to activ in come quarter   we think motor vehicl product will be a slight negat  hous will be rough flat  and consum spend will be restrain by fundament that are onli be offset by the tax cut  the risk surround that outlook are like to be further test by the soften under way in labor market   as seen in the lower left panel  a four week move averag of initi claim for unemploy insur has march steadili higher thus far this year   accompani that deterior has been a sharp slow in privat payrol   as seen by the black line at the right  manufactur and relat firm in wholesal trade and help suppli have been shed worker at a progress fa  rate sinc last year   and in recent month  we have seen evid that employ increas in privat servic produc industri have step down consider   all told  we anticip total privat payrol to shrink               by about         per month this summer  with a pickup in employ onli occur earli next year  from this current posit of weak  it look like a long way to get to the         percent growth that we have project for        and  inde  we expect the period immedi ahead to be touch and go with respect to whether the economi can avoid outright declin in aggreg output   assum it    the eventu cessat of inventori liquid should provid a boost to product  employ  and incom   moreov  we see two other consider pluse for the economi  the s ulus from monetari polici and fiscal polici  the subject of your next two chart  as shown in the upper panel of chart    the recent eas of monetari polici has restor an upward tilt to the yield curv  after last year   s invers   the consider declin over the past year in both long term and short term interest rate should help buoy activ by eas balanc sheet strain and lower the cost of capit to busi and household   but other element of the financi configur are not so support as interest rate   in equiti market  the price earn ratio  shown in the middl left panel  has general move lower over the past year  even as real interest rate have come down   moreov  the real exchang valu of the dollar  shown at the right  move still higher over this period  the lower left panel reproduc the bluebook chart that summar these various factor in the form of an es  rang for the equilibrium real feder fund rate  the shade area   the actual real fund rate has now fallen below it histor averag and below our es  of the equilibrium real rate   of cours  while the actual real fund rate has fallen  so too has the equilibrium rate  suggest somewhat less s ulus from the current set of polici than might be judg from movement in the fund rate alon   in the panel to the right  we use the frb us model to pars out it es      basi point declin in the equilibrium fund rate sinc the middl of last year   about half the declin reflect increas in the equiti premium and the exchang rate   the other half of the declin larg reflect the drop in es  structur product growth   while the rang of uncertainti surround ani of these es  is larg  we do think the analysi suggest that monetari polici will be a sourc of s ulus to activ go forward  the same can be said for fiscal polici  the subject of your next chart   the tax plan sign by the presid was similar in it element to the one we incorpor in the may  book  though a bit less generous in the near term and more generous next year   the key element are describ in the upper left panel   a tax rebat of     billion will be paid out between juli and septemb   a perman tax reduct of    billion will take place this fiscal year and a     billion cut is schedul for fiscal       as i am sure you can appreci  we had to engag in a process that was as much art as scienc as we built into our project the effect of these cut in tax               on privat spend and product   as note to the right  we made a number of key assumpt each of which is a gross simplif of a complex realiti   we assum that for some household consumpt track cash flow close  and they are assum to spend tax rebat and perman tax cut reason fulli over sever quarter   other household will spend onli a small fraction of their rebat check and will adjust spend slowli to their increas in after tax incom  final  some of the initi effect of the boost to spend will be absorb by a drawdown of inventori  the effect of the empir implement of these assumpt on the level of real gdp are depict in the graph at the middl left   the black solid line show the effect of the tax cut on inventori invest  the red shade area show the es  spend effect  and the red solid line show the total effect on the level of real gdp   as can be seen  we expect the initi jump in spend s ul by the tax cut to be part met in the second half of the year by a drawdown of inventori   move into       the next instal of the perman cut maintain the s ulus to spend  and busi should  all els equal  move to replenish inventori   taken togeth  these influenc push up the level of real gdp through much of next year   the panel to the right simpli convert the level effect on gdp shown at the left into growth rate contribut   as you can see  the effect on the growth of real gdp are largest in the second half of this year  but they remain posit through most of       govern spend also boost activ over our project period   real feder purchas  the red bar in the lower left panel  are project to acceler this year to a   percent annual pace and to increas about       percent in       purchas by state and local govern  the dark bar  are expect to be reason well maintain over the project period   mani of these govern are now experienc some revenu shortfal associ with the slowdown in activ   howev  assum that there is a pickup in spend and incom next year  overal fiscal posit remain strong enough to tide these govern over dure this period without a sharp curtail of current spend plan  at this point  we no longer see further substanti fiscal s ulus as a major risk to our project   the feder budget surplus is expect to be      billion in fiscal year      and      billion in fiscal        but the on budget portion has dwindl to between     and     billion this year and next  and if you take out the medicar hospit insur trust fund  the surplus avail for spend or tax cut is just about gone  with that  i   ll turn the present over to
as dave note  the tax cut has been a key influenc on our think about the near term project   almost all of the rebat check should be mail out over a ten week period begin the week of juli   rd   as shown in the upper left panel of chart    we are assum that spend out of the rebat  the               gray portion of the bar  will provid an import lift to pce dure the next three quarter  with the largest effect in the fourth quarter of this year   as shown by the red portion  the perman cut like will have onli a bare percept influenc this year  but next year they should come into their own as a second and more substanti round of rate reduct come on line  the upper right panel show the influenc of the tax cut on the growth of real pce   absent the tax s ulus  as shown by the red line  we would have pce growth slow further in the third quarter to less than   percent at an annual rate  befor pick up somewhat through the rest of the forecast period   but if the tax relat s ulus play out as we expect  the quarter just end will mark the trough in term of pce growth  and spend should acceler in the third and especi fourth quarter of this year  over the longer term  the person save rate help to anchor our pce project   the middl left panel outlin a few recent and prospect influenc on the save rate   first  with some crack detect work  our flow of fund section discov that bea has been underes  employ contribut to privat pension plan sinc        by last year  the miss had ramp up to rough     billion   bea has indic to us that the problem won   t be fulli address until       when they next publish a comprehens revis of the nipa   second  bea announc earlier this year that data from the unemploy insur system show about     billion more in wage and salari incom in      than is current reflect in the nipa   this one will get fix next month  with the public of the regular annual revis   as shown in the middl right panel  all els equal  a veri import caveat when think about possibl revis to the save rate  these two factor suggest that the actual save rate is higher than the measur save rate  and by enough to put it back into posit territori   more import  these adjust remov a littl bit of downsid risk from the outlook  over the project period  the various provis of the tax cut will caus the save rate to bounc around  as household smooth their spend in the face of choppi incom   and  we expect the revers wealth effect to be put some upward pressur on the save rate   by the end of next year  onc the tax cut effect have larg play out  the save rate  shown as the black line in the bottom panel  should have settl at the somewhat higher level impli by our project ratio of wealth to incom  which we have shown here as a three year move averag  on an invert scale  your next chart turn to the subject of whether there is a capit overhang   you have receiv a staff report on this issu  which  i should say  benefit from the help that sever reserv bank provid in facilit convers with busi contact   the top panel summar the key econometr result   for each of two type of equip  high tech and other  we es  a target level of the capit stock  shown in each panel with a red line  which we assum to be a function of variabl such as the level of output and the cost of capit   then we compar the               target to the actual capit stock  which we show with black line   if the actual capit stock exceed the target  we say there is a capit overhang  and indic it with gray shade   by this method  which obvious is imprecis and subject to a slew of caveat  we es  that firm are hold rough    percent more high tech equip than they would prefer  the left panel  and about    percent more other equip than they would like  the right panel   one thing to say in favor of these es  is that they do seem to line up reason well with the view of our busi contact  an interest relat issu is the role that network type market might play in generat capit overhang   the middl left panel trace through whi this might be so   as you know  market that involv network effect tend to tip toward one provid  becaus everyon want to belong to the network that has the largest number of user   each competitor in such a market will therefor have a strong incent to invest aggress in the earli go  to improv it chanc of becom the domin player   if sever firm each invest on a suffici scale to serv most of the potenti market  a capit overhang is almost sure to result  this kind of dynam may help explain recent develop in the market for long haul optic fiber   as is shown in the middl right panel  capac in this industri has explod in the last five year  by so much as to challeng our graphic softwar  even with a ratio scale    laughter  moreov  the volum of fiber in the ground  the black line  onli begin to tell the stori  the devic attach to either end of the fiber are also veri import for determin the capac of the network  as shown by the red line  we es  that if cut edg devic were instal on all the fiber in the ground today  the effect capac of the network would be multipli by rough six   this evid  along with a raft of convers that we   ve had over the past few week  convinc us that there is inde a glut in long haul fiber that could take quit some  e to absorb  the bottom panel summar the main conclus of our studi   first  we believ there is a capit overhang today   second  we believ that the overhang disproportion involv high tech equip   given the fa  depreci of high tech equip  this conclus suggest that today   s overhang may have a shorter half life than would otherwis be the case   third  for most firm  financi factor seem not to be a major drag on capit expenditur   to be sure  some firm are have more troubl rais money today than a few year ago  but in mani case that seem main to reflect the absenc of a viabl busi plan   final  with regard to the implic of the overhang for monetari polici  we think there are two main point to be made   first  we think the overhang is onli a moder negat influenc on the outlook   put simpli  even if we could somehow take the overhang away immedi  we would still have a weak project for real activ  second  we believ that the overhang is not like to notic impair the effect of monetari polici   if monetari polici work primarili by influenc the demand for equip  we might think otherwis   but monetari polici work on a wide varieti of spend  includ hous  pce  and net               export  through a number of channel in financi market   moreov  we never have been abl to demonstr a vigor channel oper through cost of capit effect on invest spend  especi in the short run   therefor  despit the capit overhang  we believ that monetari polici will be about as effect in the current eas cycl as it has been in previous eas cycl  your next chart turn to the broader topic of the outlook for invest   a good deal of concern has focus on the volum of debt that was issu to financ the invest boom of the late     s   but  as shown by the black line in the upper left panel  interest expens remain onli a moder sourc of pressur on cash flow through the first quarter of this year for the nonfinanci corpor sector as a whole   to be sure  as shown by the red line  the telecom servic firm  which collect have seen a doubl of their interest burden in just five year  are a notabl except   similar  as shown in the upper right panel  the expect default frequenc has increas much more sharpli for the telecom servic firm than for the nonfinanci corpor sector as a whole   we interpret these data as suggest that  for most firm  financi consider will not sharpli curtail capit spend  that said  a sober reassess of prospect for the telecom sector may have help put the spark to the tinder last year  but onc the fire was go a tradit acceler dynam appear to have taken over  as is illustr in the middl panel  as the growth of busi output slow in the second half of last year and into the first half of this year  firm cut the growth of their real spend for non high tech equip and softwar sharpli   and while we believ that some of the extraordinari weak in this sector will abat later this year  a reviv in e s spend may not be on solid foot until some  next year when it becom more evid to firm that busi output is reacceler  turn to nonresidenti invest  some crosscurr are influenc the outlook   activ in drill and mine has been boost by the high price of oil and natur gas  and spend by util has been support by the need for new electr generat capac   but as shown in the lower left panel  these two sector account for onli about a fifth of overal nonresidenti invest  moreov  as shown at the lower right  prospect for the sector overal are much dimmer than in the past year or two  reflect among

left panel  is one of the key build block in our think about the prospect for inflat  you may be reliev to learn that i plan no further dissert on that topic today  other than to note that fluctuat in structur product growth shape our es  of the    short run    or    effect    nairu  shown in the upper right panel   inde  given our anticip path for structur product  we expect the effect nairu to rise to about       percent by the middl of next year   this impli that the project rise               in the unemploy rate put a bit less downward pressur on inflat than one might otherwis have thought  in addit to lower resourc util  a number of other factor influenc the contour of the price forecast over the next year and a half   one factor help to reduc core inflat is a moder in energi price  which  as shown in the middl left panel  now seem to be well in train   if it continu as we expect  energi price should take about     percentag point off the chang in core inflat from this

togeth  all three measur of core inflat shown in the bottom panel are more or less flat from their current level  your next chart examin the situat in the labor market   the top panel relat the

inflat of the last two year  the gray bar  is like to contribut to a more rapid rate of growth of compens this year  the red line   and  as shown in the middl right panel  we believ someth similar will occur with respect to product growth  compens demand appear to reflect product develop onli with a veri long lag   as a result  the rapid growth of product dure the last few year is like to still be feed through into compens growth at least for the remaind of the forecast period   all told  as shown in the bottom panel  we expect compens growth as measur by the employ cost index to be about the same this year as last  as the effect of eas resourc util is about offset by the larger contribut from lag inflat   next year  howev  we expect the eci to deceler as the downturn in energi price

thank you veri much   what i found most interest in the present was the veri inform evalu of the capit overhang  a subject on which a detail report was sent around to the committe   specif  i thought the elabor of the situat in the telecommun industri was realli most use   in that regard  as i recal that report gave a number that indic that the volum of network type market doubl everi year   what is the sourc of that number   and what is it definit
if i   m recal correct  i think that was from a convers we had with one of our busi contact   i believ it was in the context of one of the ceo remark that previous he or she had thought that demand would doubl everi three month and now catastroph had befallen them and it onli doubl onc a year
no  as i rememb  the quot was that it had been doubl everi year but was go to start to doubl everi three or four month   then whoever wrote that part of the paper said that inde it had not chang  it was just doubl everi year  now  the implic is that that mean someth   if onli i knew what it was   it   s obvious refer to some digit flow measur and i   ve seen the quot befor   moor   s law i understand becaus that can actual be document   but what are peopl talk about here
mayb somebodi can help me by find the refer
it may be the data packet that are be transmit across the fiber optic network   we get those es  from a major consult firm that we have an arrang with
what is the frequenc
i suspect it   s semi occasion  but i   m not sure    laughter  speaker      whenev they have a contract that pay them to do it
yes  okay    laughter   incident  on chart     one is obvious struck by the middl panel in that asian semiconductor product appear to track world shipment data  i mean allow for play around with scale
yes  the scale is make that relationship look good
yes  but i m just curious about that big breakaway at the end of the most recent period   is that a price or market share issu or just plain statist nois
to be honest  i don t know   let me just make sure that what we   ve plot there is understood  it s the whole industri product index of the asian semiconductor produc countri that is be averag
it s a physic volum index
right  but it   s of their total industri product not just their semiconductor product
the chart say asian semiconductor produc
the ip of asian countri that produc semiconductor is how you should read that
that identifi the countri and it is the averag ip for those countri
okay  sorri about that   the chart could benefit from some improv in the label  if i may say so   presid
mr  chairman  i too thought the capit overhang paper was a veri good paper   i was particular impress with the fact that the staff did the econometr analysi and then went out and spoke to peopl in the industri  and essenti those convers verifi the find in the econometr analysi
i won   t make ani comment on our standard error
well  i was wonder if you had ani thought as to whether the financi market actual are reflect this overhang now  and whether you can relat that in ani way to one of the altern simul in the  book  the    earn disappoint     one   is this alreadi built into market price or is this an indic that we   re go to see a big earn disappoint relat to that simul
i think it s hard to know   it certain is the case that the telecom sector has been punish incred   stock price of the telecom servic firm and the equip maker have been beaten down by just astonish proport   whether they ve taken on board the full extent of the outlook as we see it  i can t say  though by and larg the raw materi of the analysi we ve done are in the public sector   in this particular regard i don t think we have ani inform that is not avail to a care market analyst   that  sn t insur that it   s reflect in the current level of price by ani mean
it s hard to know exact how close connect it is to the capit overhang per se   obvious  what we are tri to communic in that particular simul is               that we do see some possibl of consider tension in our outlook for profit  which is weaker than market analyst are current report   now  that could be resolv in a number of way   one  earn could turn out to be weaker than the analyst think   mayb that is alreadi discount in the market  which is part of what you are ask   two  investor in essenc could be more patient in this period of weak earn if they realli foresaw a snapback in activ  even if it s go to be a bit delay   three  as in the simul that we present in the  book  there could be some consider downsid risk to stock price go forward   or four  as in the simul that we present in the bluebook  we could be wrong about product  mayb develop on the product front will turn out to be better than we are current anticip and we   ll get a bit better earn growth than is envis in the  book forecast   so  i think there is a wide rang of possibl here  but we do see some tension current in the financi set relat to our econom forecast
thank you      on chart   label    fiscal polici     in the lower right hand corner the unifi budget surplus for fiscal year       for this fiscal year  which is three fourth over  is shown as      billion   i recal see the other day that the treasuri report a surplus for the month of april alon of      billion   am i right that from this point forward  the combin of the spend growth that you and other have assum  the rebat and the lower withhold  mean that outlay will exceed receipt for the balanc of the calendar year
i m not sure exact   you re cite  i suppos  the month treasuri statement figur   and if those figur are right  that   s exact what our forecast would               be anticip   we have also heard from the treasuri that receipt are come in weaker than had been expect  and we   ve tri to factor that in   but there could be some downsid risk even to the receipt forecast go forward as well
yes  but from that standpoint  abstract from the fiscal year and the full calendar year issu  your interpret would be that at least for the near term there is go to be less fiscal drag and more fiscal s ulus for the balanc of the calendar year
probabl yes  though i m not quit sure   to gaug the overal  effect on the economi one would want to look at the month flow of spend and receipt   so i would be more comfort look at a more aggreg level   anoth factor that is affect the pattern of these figur somewhat is a shift of corpor tax receipt out of the end of this fiscal year into next fiscal year  that was a part of the budget deal in the tax cut propos in order to give some room to do a littl more spend in fiscal        the basic point we want to make is that in recent  book we have been argu that there were perhap more upsid risk on the fiscal polici side than we had built into the forecast becaus we could see these unus  on budget surplus out there   and by our current es  the tail of the distribut in term of risk for s ul fiscal polici go forward has been consider shorten
i would say that the unifi budget surplus forecast in the  book suggest that on a not season adjust basi the third quarter is about in balanc and the fourth quarter is a slight surplus   but the season pattern this year isn   t signific differ from other year  asid from the     billion outflow   last year  almost the entir surplus occur in the second quarter  of cours  becaus that s when the person tax receipt come in   so  the basic pattern isn t that differ this year  asid from the     billion go out in rebat in the third quarter
part of the reason i m ask is becaus the huge tax payment that were made in april by busi and household  which were come out of the privat economi and into the govern side of the economi  are behind us now   from this point forward  at least for the calendar year  we don t have that flow impact
incident  do we have a fiscal      unifi budget es  consist with the current data we have here
we don t yet becaus we have not yet extend our forecast out to       but we will be do that in the next few month
thank you   this is just a clarifi question on chart    the middl panel   in your discuss you suggest  i think  that the spark that creat the movement down in invest start with telecommun and then move over to real e s spend other than high tech   did i hear you correct when you were refer to the relationship of the high tech sector to the declin in other invest spend
what i was tri to do was to lay out some theori on the  e  or the sequenc in which these event might have unfold
i ask becaus activ in the manufactur sector was probabl declin even befor the downturn in the high tech sector   so i had it revers in a sens   i   m just have a hard  e follow your theori exact in term of this downturn and i wonder whether there are ani implic if i disagre with you on that  if i don t think the tech sector had much to do with this perhap
i would hate to go to the mat on that issu without have a chanc to look at the data first   my sens is that the gist of this channel  as shown in the middl chart  is               that by and larg a sort of tradit acceler mechan seem to have oper here   one element that is unusu  though  is that mani peopl perceiv the origin shock to have been one to busi invest   and at least a compon of that shock seem to have come from the telecom servic sector   those firm themselv account for what is  at least to me  an astonish fraction of overal invest   i don t have the figur nail down but it   s somewher between    and    percent of overal equip invest   so clear  the reassess of the prospect for the telecom servic sector was import  but that s not to suggest that develop in the industri sector were not also an import contribut factor
there is no doubt that mani manufactur firm also have been under intens pressur from competit abroad  given the strength of the dollar   we saw that by the declin in a varieti of area outsid of the tech area as well   we do think that was also an import element in promulg this weak
i just want to make sure i heard it right
back on the tax cut issu  you make an assumpt  right  i think   about how much of the spend is go to come out of inventori   but i don t see anyon suggest that ani of the spend is go to be use for import  which in a mathemat sens would be a drag on gdp   how should we think about that   is that such a small number that we shouldn   t worri about it at all   or has it just not been talk about much and we probabl should think about it
well  we   ve look at the number a bit   we don t have ani analysi that would enabl us to say that these tax rebat will be spent differ than other consumpt dollar are spent   but we did look at the histor track of import as a percent of consumpt               and it has been rise   it s not possibl to calcul it precis becaus the way the import are report there are capit good  there are consum good  and auto is a separ categori  auto general are some of each  so who know   put import of good in the numer and consumpt of good in the denomin produc a ratio of            percent or someth like that and it has been rise over  e   that is one step in the direct of answer the question  that s exclud the auto complet  i think  and it would be a littl more if one tri to make some allow for that by put in some auto
i  too  thought the capit overhang paper was veri good   among other thing  it move my knowledg of fiber optic from   to   percent  a big increas   but as i look at chart    i   m troubl by someth   as best i can tell from draw line  the capit overhang began to open up about    month ago  right around the start of year        and if one look close  it s realli not close at this point     month later   in the  book baselin project  it appear to me that equip and softwar is slack through the fourth quarter of this year and then start rise at fair healthi rate   so  we   ve got this overhang that has develop and has been with us for a year and a half  and we know the economi is quit weak   the question is   what is it that turn this around and get invest grow at seem reason rate in just six month
well  there are a coupl of element that i can throw out   one is  as we tri to emphas in the report  that these gap that open up between the es  target and the actual capit exert some drag on aggreg demand   and at least if you believ the model es   though i could give you a long list of reason whi you shouldn   t  these gap are rather slow to work off   so  for exampl  in the high tech graph on that chart we can see that through               most of the     s there was an alleg gap that didn t get correct   that s just to say that the overhang in high tech equip and in other equip is a moder negat on the outlook  but that in and of itself  sn t have a larg increment effect   in his remark i believ dave   highlight the two key factor that we think are go to turn the economi around  one is monetari polici and the other is fiscal polici   all this sort of roll togeth  if it becom appar that the momentum of the economi is shift  then through normal acceler effect other thing start to come along with it   but the two key prime mover would be fiscal polici and monetari polici
may i jump in   i think one of the other point that has been made in this area  you ve made it befor but you didn   t make it this  e  is that this type of capit tend to depreci relat quick compar to some other type   i assum that s part of your think as you consid how this gap might start to close   is that a fair point
yes  but that s realli onli true on the left side  the high tech side  and there is a big gap in the other than high tech e s spend
so your stori is that the gap may be with us for a while  but that  sn t mean that invest won t be recov   that s basic it
yes  you can see it in the upper right panel of     s chart   if those es  are to be believ  we have had a gap for a decad   we had growth of invest over that period as well   it s alway tempt  when we re in a period of extrem slow growth or even a downturn in activ  to wonder how we will ever get back to posit growth again   as   mention we see polici  both monetari and fiscal  support that   we also see support from just the simpl inventori dynam that we are go through right now where product is               well below sale and we have inventori liquid   when that process end  we do get a pickup in employ and incom and that begin to feed sale and sale expect   so we don t think it s unreason to expect that by the middl of next year we ll be return to more robust growth in invest spend   but in keep with governor     s edict  we would readili admit that there is enorm uncertainti about that
may i just ask a question about the regress analysi use in creat your target   in the upper right hand panel  the target is a calcul number come off a regress  i presum  fit to the actual data
fit to the actual data and es  in a system of four equat involv these two element of equip plus nonresidenti structur as a third and inventori as a fourth
if you take the trend out  which give you a nice fat correl  it look pretti aw to me   how can you be confid that what you have is truli excess   if you were deal with rate of return or someth like that  perhap you could somehow demonstr that the rate of return are fall  that you re get less return per unit of capit   do you feel comfort with this sort of relationship     it tell you all that much
i could never plead guilti to feel comfort with someth as far remov from what ordinari busi decis maker see as their realiti   if i were to tri to defend this as best i could  i   d say that one piec of corrobor evid is that if we look at averag period over which there has been an overhang  defin by the shade gray area  they correspond to period of slower than averag growth   and by contrast  the period when the actual stock was short of the target stock are one with fa  growth   now all kind of thing were go on dure those period  the overhang wasn t the onli factor by ani mean   but that s               one piec of corrobor evid   and then  consist with presid   s comment  it   make me feel a littl better that when we went out and talk with some real peopl
that i can understand
i guess i manag to take some comfort in that  mayb more frank than from these model es
is there ani way you can back out the excess  essenti  what we mean by overhang is capit that is not yield it rate of return in the way presid pool was rais the question   sinc we do have profit data by industri and we have capit by industri  isn   t there a way to infer whether or not the capit is short   in other word  if capit is short  one would expect the rate of return to be abov normal and vice versa  wouldn t that give you a more sensit judgment as to where the overhang are
i don t think i can answer that on the spot  but i ll certain think about that   it s an interest question
the reason i rais the issu of look at it in term of individu industri  rather than on a macro basi  is that there are five or six major sector of the economi for which we do have profit margin and  i would think  effect data on capit stock  presid broaddus
i have a detail question on chart         in those panel on the right  export for we n europ are buck the trend   whi is that  ms  son   well  it is the case that for longer than ani other region of the global economi we n europ believ itself to be protect  in a sens  from some of the negat consequ of what was go on   in part that was becaus  they would alleg  the region is a larg self contain and relat close economi and   not have a big high tech                 produc sector   that had been in some sens a shortcom dure the boom year of the late    s  but sudden it becam a benefit   other than nokia and ericsson  and i suppos philip  they don t have ani major technolog firm   in ani event  they are certain less into high tech than the unit state   so they didn t have clear sector with larg employ that were go to lead the charg down   in all honesti  if you look on chart     you ll see that domest demand in the euro area was actual rather weak in q   but their export to other part of the world held up and kept up their gdp   obvious  sinc that figur is for h   it incorpor our view on q   but you can see that gdp is much stronger than domest demand in the earlier period on our calcul   that was certain true in q    so their export held up and they bought from us  and for a long  e they assert that their gdp was at about potenti in a level sens  grow at what they thought was an accept rate of a robust   percent  and they felt they were in good shape   now  export fell off after q  and the most recent number have been weak   but this is sort of a new develop from their point of view  and i would assum  therefor  that their import demand for our product will turn out to have weaken in q    but through q  the pictur was differ
you mention that japan may be get to the point of implement some reform that might be help   did you see the articl in the wall street journal by   sach and paul krugman
that one i miss   i ve been read mani in the last two day
well  they basic said the patient is so sick that the medicin might kill it  so japan should be care   they were make the argument that au  type measur may be too harsh for japan and the countri may not be abl to handl it
it s the same argument they ve been make for a year  that the japanes have to pump up the money suppli  howev they do it
there s a cadr of peopl within japan who are argu that there is a sequenc issu  recoveri and reform or reform and recoveri   there are reason peopl  and i consid krugman and sach on some day to be reason  on the side that say recoveri and then reform   the problem with that argument  of cours  is that to some extent that is the histori of the past    year  and look where it has gotten them
the other problem with the argument is that it   s wrong
well  it has been tri for    year and noth has happen
it hasn t work yet anyway  but the   th year might be the charm
do they just fritter away their ammunit by do thing on too small a scale for a long period of  e
well  there   s some possibl of that   the other concern is that it  sn t necessarili answer your question about whether the patient can toler the medicin   it   not mean that if they aggress undertak reform that the patient won t die  in the sens of have some signific negat and social disrupt sequenc of econom event beset them   at this point it s almost an articl of faith between these two camp as to what s import  caught in the middl  of cours  is the bank of japan  it may have one last arrow in it quiver and it   s call    quantit eas     which mean differ thing to differ peopl   boj offici are wait to shoot that arrow at the point when they think it is most need and will do the most good   so they are say do the reform and if the patient start to get sicker befor he start to               get well  we will step in and do what we can   other are say no  use this devic now to get the economi stronger so it can withstand the physic therapi a littl better   again  i think it s veri hard to be certain  ex ant  which of those argument is better found   but the histori of the last    year suggest that normal recoveri step aren t go to buy them anyth
thank you   let me return for just a minut to the project for restor growth next year   it s pretti clear that the impetus for that is go to come from fiscal and monetari polici and mayb the cessat of this inventori cycl   you have essenti a trend growth project for next year of around     percent growth   where is this go to manifest itself in the various sector of the economi   what do you see lead us back out here  are capit expenditur go to come back and be a leader again   are we go to see renew growth in hous and automobil   what sector are go lead the return
in some sens  governor    as we show in the chart  we do think that in the near term fiscal polici is go to be provid a boost to an alreadi weak economi
right   that s where the impetus come from but where   it manifest itself
as we move through the second half of the year  we are look for some impetus on the consum spend side and through the eventu cessat of the inventori correct   we think monetari polici will be provid some support as we go through the year and into next year in help to maintain the reason high level of auto sale and hous start we have had   also we expect monetari polici to be provid an environ in which busi can pump up their balanc sheet and then be prepar to take advantag of               the opportun on the invest side that we think are go to be there from the trend product we   re project   so when that underbrush get clear away  there will be an environ in which both consum spend and busi invest are back  in term of provid import support to growth   for the near term it   s consumpt though  we don   t realli see much in capit spend until next year
well  next year will be fair balanc then  if i m hear you correct in term of where the growth is go to show up
next year will be fair balanc   we are still get some depress effect on consumpt from the wealth effect   it s not push growth further down  but it is a factor keep the growth of consumpt run below the growth of incom   but yes  by the middl of next year we think growth will look more balanc than it   current
okay   i think it s about  e we recess   let me remind you that we have a dinner at the british embassi this even   the board van will be at the waterg hotel at        cocktail are schedul at        i presum that we can leav our paper here   this room will be made secur  so you don t have to worri about lug your paper around unless you choos to do so   meet recess                june     morn session
good morn  everyon   we are now at the point on our agenda where the committe   s discuss of the economi begin and i m look for volunt  presid jordan
thank you   now that i have volunt  all i have to do is find my paper    laughter   sorri  i wasn t quit prepar   i would like to comment first by provid some general impress about econom activ in the district   as one of our busi advisori council member said  we are    bump along the bottom      activ is not continu to declin but it is not rebound   and except for the steel industri  i think that general summar what director and advisori council member think about the situat in our region  we had report from a corrug box compani and separ from a freight deliveri compani that are both headquart in the district of a rebound in the second quarter after steep declin in the first quarter   now  one assert was that corrug paper box are the best indic there is  but the chairman should know better than i whether that   s true   a supplier of side  deck  window materi  and pvc pipe  and this is a compani that manufactur and sell nationwid as well as a bit intern  report that they had experienc a veri recent pickup in order   accord  they are hope that the second half will be better than the first half   a manufactur of tape and glue said that demand for industri use of their product continu to declin but consum busi was flat or up slight   a contact from a compani that suppli materi for motor vehicl part said that demand from the u s  big three was down while demand from transplant and from plant in mexico was up   he also note that their busi in europ was weaker in the second quarter than it had been in the first quarter               report from import industri in kentucki were mix  and some were especi interest   first  the state s budget is be bail out in a sens by strong coal sever tax revenu   the complaint in that area is still the lack of coal miner  but other than that busi is terrif   second  it is es  that    percent of this year s crop of thoroughbr colt die or were born dead   those death had someth to do with cherri blossom and spring and caterpillar  and it s a long stori   industri observ es  that over the next three year that will cost kentucki thoroughbr farm a half billion dollar   now that the caus is known  they think this year   s experi will not be repeat   but of cours noth can be done about the loss that have occur alreadi  as for retail compani  feder is headquart in our district and we have groceri compani and other retail as well   feder report  and this relat to it store nationwid rather than just in our district  that apparel sale were down sharpli and are expect to continu to declin until the first part of next year   but kroger   s say that groceri store sale are at record level and they are confid of sustain growth   in fact  a director from a dri good compani said that the onli explan he could come up with is that peopl must be buy food in store and cook it at home   he cite that as a sign of how bad thing are  a major landscap compani  scott   s  said that it spring sale were the weakest in year   layoff continu to be announc in manufactur but we have had some report of continu labor shortag in other sector   a larg region bank note that it has about     job open compani wide and that it is especi difficult to hire for it urban area locat   some hospit health care organ report open in as mani as    percent of their staff posit  includ the housekeep staff   a compani that oper nation and employ       worker in the tree surgeri and mainten busi report that worker turnov is still               veri high  it some  run as much as    percent   they continu to use recruit  retent  and reloc bonus in their effort to fill open   our contact said that all segment of their busi in all region are strong except for the california power compani  which are delinqu and refus to pay their bill   it continu to be hard to recruit and retain long haul truck driver   high fuel cost had been affect those compani but a contact at one firm at least said that they were now get some relief on earn becaus fuel cost have come down a bit  let me turn to the nation situat   it seem to me that at a  e when the problem of some industri and sector are so clear due to excess suppli  structur kind of problem  whether domest or foreign  there is a risk that ad abund liquid will caus overh in those area such as hous that continu to be strong   but that liquid is not go to provid ani relief to other troubl sector   neither the price nor the avail of credit is a problem for the smaller compani  for the truck manufactur or telecommun firm  the furnitur or textil compani in al broaddus   s district  or the person comput and electron firm in texa or elsewher   the excess retail space is not go to be quick absorb as a consequ of increas monetari s ulus   and ad further to the alreadi ampl liquid in the financi system is not go to caus apparel sale to rebound sudden  we seem to have three sourc of s ulus in the work right now   we have monetari s ulus and fiscal s ulus   moreov  after two year of higher energi price  those price are now declin and  from what i hear  they may declin even more than the staff forecast suggest  certain  some advers effect on household and various industri  sector  and region  not onli in our countri but around the world  occur when energi price were high  most notabl in our own prc  the peopl s republ of california    laughter   but the effect were not all               advers either for the unit state or elsewher   the increas in energi price did effect communic the need for greater energi suppli as well as the valu of innov in energi conserv   it is gratifi to see that we have had a signific increas in energi product  and a lot more will be come on stream over the next year or so  especi electr capac  also  some truli remark effici in energi consumpt are be achiev by commerci enterpris  thank to better manag   so we are now in a period of fall energi price  in larg part a reflect of the substanti greater aggreg suppli of energi  not declin demand   and that is go to increas both our incom and our output   we have monetari s ulus  of cours  i don t need to say anyth more about that   and final  we have fiscal s ulus  american busi and household are go to get four    postcard    over the next nine month to give them an idea of how perman the tax reduct is   start next week  they will see a reduct in withhold   quantit it may not be larg  but it is a messag  some  in the next two or three month they will get a check in the mail   whether it s larg or not  it will be a messag   on januari  st of next year they will see a further withhold reduct  and then next april they will either pay smaller tax or get a bigger refund than previous   so in nine month     e peopl will get four messag that their tax  state as well as feder  are go down   over the prior month  the first four or five month of this year  american peopl sent a lot of check to their govern  mani of them larg check   a lot of those tax payment were on earn realiz in the year       and peopl may not even have the money anymor   in some case  they probabl had to borrow to pay their tax   so over the first four month of this year  as my question ye day was tri to impli  household as well as busi were feel the pinch of have to shift a great deal of cash to uncl sam and their               state and local govern   that period is now over for this calendar year   from this point on  basic we are go to have fiscal s ulus in the pipelin  augment by monetari s ulus and fall energi price   we d better be care   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   while our southeast economi is still show modest growth  it has slow further sinc our last meet   we continu to look for some first sign of a rebound  but have not seen them yet   the economist who led off the region part of my brief for this meet start his present with the remark     it look like a bummer of a summer      retail seem to have grown more weari with the now sluggish pace of sale   while sale are general in line with lower expect  retail are pessimist about the month ahead   for the first  e sinc the disappoint christma season  mani are express concern about inventori be abov desir level   manufactur continu to contract  with weak now show up in apparel  textil  aluminum  steel  petrochem  truck  and luxuri boat   on the other hand  despit our general concern about the pace of invest spend  compani in our grow southern auto industri  includ nissan  toyota  honda  and saturn  are proceed with major new invest and expans  should over invest result or auto sale falter  our expect is that cutback would not be at these new  more effici facil but rather would be born by older plant in other part of the countri  report have also been a littl less posit on the outlook for tourism  one sector that has been on my list of posit until now   while book are slight below year ago level  the strong dollar and higher fuel price are both seen as cut into busi   and the fire in               florida are keep some peopl away   excess capac is also contribut to tourism   s woe  as a host of larg new cruis ship and luxuri hotel are come on line at just the wrong  e  trade in our region depend  more than in other part of the countri  on a healthi and grow latin america      son has alreadi touch on some of the negat in that part of the world  but i would like to underscor the observ that develop in the import economi of argentina and brazil do not bode well for the short term outlook in south america  argentin author have de facto begun to devalu the peso and have abandon their dollar peg under the guis of an export subsidi   in my view  that is unlik to spur econom growth and may well be the precursor to increas financi instabl in the region   in brazil  the emerg of electr power crise virtual halv the outlook for real econom growth in the short term  and further foreign invest in the region may be threaten   the two largest economi are not the onli troubl spot in latin america  and the deterior overal outlook in that region onli add to the potenti for a drag on both our southeast economi and on the u s  economi more broad  one other negat develop is the deterior fiscal outlook for sever of our southea n state   revenu collect are down in alabama  louisiana  florida  and tennesse  and spend has alreadi been cut  the bright spot in our region remain the same   in addit to auto  which i have alreadi mention  construct is hold up amaz well   residenti build is about flat on a year over year basi but still at a veri high level   commerci construct continu at a respect pace but we are now see some slack develop  as larg block of offic space come back on the market for subleas and develop becom more cautious   while more slack is appear in our labor market  employ growth at l     percent continu to outpac that of               the nation by a consider margin   loan activ has slacken  and that is onli part due to tighter lend standard   fund for qualifi borrow continu to be avail but credit qualiti concern remain   inde  inform from visa  pass on by one of our director who manag a larg credit counsel busi  indic that they have rais their es  of the increas in bankruptci this year from    percent to    percent if the bankruptci reform legisl pass and to    percent if it   not   have highlight those concern over credit qualiti  i would observ that our bank examin are still express confid in our bank    abil to deal with the present level of stress   final  the pocket of signific price increas remain most the same  health care insur  asphalt  and truck rate   lumber price have join that list for some special reason  at the nation level  my sens of where we are and what is like ahead is not appreci differ from the  book s   the economi continu to stumbl along  with littl evid that the     basi point of polici eas that we ve done this year is yet have much notic effect on key sector of the economi   although i continu to say both privat and public that i do expect to see more encourag develop by year end  it s hard at this point to see where a quick shot of broad new momentum is go to come from   our patienc is about to be test   i share the view that major new invest spend   not seem immin and that it s not just high tech firm that are be cautious   the chief financi offic of up  whose corpor headquart are in atlanta  told us earlier this week that they are hold off on the purchas of new truck and airplan until busi resum   the stori we hear over and over again is that it s not lower interest rate but rather increas sale that will trigger a new round of invest spend   consum spend other than for hous and auto is now more subdu  and the under fundament other than the expect s ulus from the tax cut do               not suggest to me that basic spend is like to pick up over the near term   the deterior employ outlook push in the other direct   with corpor earn and stock price languish  there s no wealth kicker at work   and we are not go to get ani push from export or from state and local spend over the near term  so where do i think this leav us   as i suggest earlier  i believ we are at a point where we need to grit our teeth  mu  up some patienc  have some faith in our forecast  and help other to do the same as well   while we are almost certain to get more disappoint data in the month immedi ahead  it is also clear that the adjust from the excess that develop earlier are well under way   furthermor  our aggress monetari polici eas  with it lag  and the fortun  e of the tax law chang can reason be expect to kick in at about the  e the economi get back on track for it own fundament reason  we   ll have our polici discuss in a few minut  but i have a few broad lead up thought on that   it s my sens that most fed watcher have come to believ that we will continu eas  perhap in big    basi point step  until we see concret evid that the economi has turn around and has new upward momentum   that is not what i think we intend or want to do   my sens is that it is not still lower interest rate that will cure the remain ill  but rather some fundament adjust that other in the economi need to make and in fact are make   while i recogn that not everyon is a believ at this point in the grow risk of inflat in the outlook  i have to give some weight to those forecast  includ my own bank   s model work  that suggest it is  e to give those risk more weight   pile on still more eas is veri like to make our job even more difficult when we need to revers polici   substanti downsid risk remain   one more smaller eas move now so as not to disrupt market               expect at such a fragil point  along with a clear    all done    messag and a remind of the lag polici effect  might be our best contribut at this point   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the seventh district is much the same as i report last  e  sluggish   most industri contact in tradit manufactur character their industri as bump along the bottom  similar to what jerri jordan said about his district   there is a littl differ from the situat he describ in that some of our contact report that condit are still get wors   report from high tech firm were uniform dismal   at our last meet  i note that an increas number of firm were delay invest expenditur  and that trend has continu   some firm are simpli refus to buy ani more comput equip until condit improv  on a more posit note  the latest chicago purchas manag    report  to be releas this friday  show the composit index move up from      in may to      in june  that s it highest level for the year   all compon indic less weak in june except for inventori  where a sharper declin probabl should be review as good news   the report general suggest both better prospect for growth and lower inflationari pressur   this inform  of cours  should be kept confidenti until friday morn  we held our eighth annual auto outlook symposium in detroit earlier this month   it drew over     particip   like the  book  the consensus of    forecast submit by that group was that light vehicl sale would be about      million this year   those forecast were more op ist than the  book for next year  howev  in that they saw a slight increas to      million unit versus the  book forecast of      million   we also had some report that the steel industri may be near bottom   meanwhil  consum spend and hous activ               still are hold up reason well in our district   as is often the case  report from retail have been mix  with weather be an import factor influenc sale of apparel and season item   furnitur sale have been weak  while sale of other home relat item were still said to be relat strong   jewelri sale have soften slight but have not shown the sharp declin that are normal associ with a recess   hous start  permit  and sale of exist and new home in the midwest all increas from april to may and contact throughout the district indic that there has been no notic slow in hous activ in june  there was an interest dichotomi in how firm were react to looser labor market condit   on the one hand  mani firm employ higher skill worker appear to be tri even harder than usual to avoid layoff   consult and law firm were encourag new hire to take  e off befor start and were ask current employe to work part  e or take vacat sooner rather than later   but they general were not let peopl go   we had similar report about skill job in manufactur and in certain segment of the build trade   on the other hand  lower skill worker were be let go at a fa  than expect pace   one senior execut with mani year of experi in the temporari servic industri character the current period as the worst drop for his industri that he d seen in his career   outsid the high tech area  howev  he has seen real evid of lessen wage pressur  we also held our academ advisori council meet last week   we had a larger than usual turnout  lead academ plus four busi economist   there was a good deal of pessim about the near term outlook for invest  especi from the busi economist  no one  howev  thought the economi would slip into a recess   particip rais mani of the issu cover in ye day s discuss of the product acceler   the common opinion was that we should be cautious in base our forecast of product trend too heavili               on the last sever year of excel perform   the key messag  howev  was that the fed should not becom complac about inflat   mani thought we were give too littl attent to inflat  and the academ general thought we had either adjust polici enough or had alreadi gone too far  turn to the nation economi  a great deal of uncertainti remain about the outlook  clear  econom growth stall in the second quarter and signific sign of weak continu   the high tech overhang will persist for some  e and will be a substanti drag on futur invest spend   more general  the manufactur sector continu to contract and low rate of capac util will limit further capit invest   as unemploy continu to increas  slower incom growth will like begin to weigh on consumpt growth  in the absenc of further downward econom shock  the third and fourth quarter should show improv over the current quarter  but the downward risk to econom growth this year remain high  have said that  there are clear limit to how effect the real side risk face the u s  economi today can be address by lower short term interest rate   and i think we re get close to those limit   so far the core inflat outlook remain reason contain  howev  with the real fed fund rate well below it equilibrium level  the inflat risk becom greater as  e pass   we alway have to be alert to that danger  as we said at our last meet  there is alreadi a lot of s ulus in the pipelin   the aggress polici action taken by this committe earlier this year should soon be have notic effect and the tax cut will provid addit s ulus later this year   if the econom turnaround proceed as quick as our forecast suggest  the committe will need to quick return polici to a less expansionari set of the fund rate

thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our may meet the main chang in the econom outlook for our region is an improv in expect about futur econom condit   overal  econom activ continu to edg up   news on manufactur in our district is somewhat better than that for the nation   while manufactur activ remain weak in our district  condit have improv steadili sinc the begin of the year   our busi outlook survey of manufactur for june  which was releas last week  show some improv in the index of general econom activ   although the indic for new order and shipment both show modest declin in june  they too are much improv sinc earlier in the year   moreov  survey respond    expect about activ  new order  and shipment over the next six month move up sharpli   of cours  it remain to be seen if such expect will be fulfil   retail sale remain most flat in our region as they do in the nation   our beig book contact indic that cool  wet weather hamper sale of summer cloth and other               season merchandis   sale of big ticket item have been slow as well and sever store execut said they are prepar to reduc order if sale do not turn up   corrobor of this anecdot evid is seen in the pennsylvania sale tax collect  which have shown weak in recent month   employ in the retail sector has been flat this year  the construct sector is hold up fair well in the region  although recent sale of both exist and new home have slow somewhat   the demand for offic and commerci space has soften   the offic vacanc rate has held steadi in the philadelphia central busi district so far this year  but vacanc rate have move up in some suburban market  which had been among the fastest grow area dure this expans   despit the soften in recent activ  construct employ in our region has increas this year   howev  recent data suggest that the overal employ pictur for the district has deterior somewhat   in april and may  payrol employ declin     percent in our tri state area  revers the first quarter increas   as in the nation  initi claim for unemploy insur are up sharpli sinc the begin of the year  price increas in the philadelphia region appear to have caught up to those in the nation   over      and       cpi inflat in philadelphia had been less than that for the nation  so far this year  price in our region have been rise more sharpli  reflect strong increas in the cost of medic care and hous  in summari  the economi in our region continu to inch up at a sluggish pace   in our staff   s view  the economi is near an inflect point   we expect the region economi to grow at a moder pace over the second half of the year  help by the s ulus from lower interest rate and feder tax cut               we hold a similar view on the nation economi   the economi has turn in a weaker perform this year than our staff  and most other forecast  i might add  expect   the inventori correct has been both deeper and has taken longer than we anticip  and the slowdown in busi invest was sharper than we expect   our current forecast is similar to that of the  book  howev  we incorpor further monetari s ulus in the near term  we expect the s ul effect of the rate cut that the committe has put into place to build dure the second half of this year and the first half of next year and then begin to subsid   we are more op ist than the board staff about inventori correct  and we see busi start to rebuild inventori veri slowli later this year and pick up the pace next year   we have stronger gdp growth in the third quarter than   the  book  but somewhat less strength in the fourth quarter   this differ is larg becaus we expect tax rebat to have a bigger posit effect in the third quarter than   the board staff forecast   averag across the second half of       we project gdp growth to be abov   percent  which is about     point fa  than the  book forecast   for       our staff forecast and the  book forecast are similar  but we see slight less acceler in growth over the year   with rise unemploy  a resumpt of fair strong product growth  and flat to slight lower oil price  we see somewhat better inflat number from mid      through       but we   re not as op ist on the inflat front as the  book part becaus we see smaller increas in unemploy  frank  i d be content if either the baselin  book forecast or the philadelphia fed forecast come to pass   unfortun  as all of us who forecast know  there are risk   our sens is that these risk  absent ani reduct in the fed fund rate  are still bias toward the downsid   but there are some upsid risk as well               i believ the most signific risk factor is the  e of the impact of the polici action we have alreadi taken   on the downsid  monetari and fiscal polici s ulus could come too late to offset weak in the labor market  and that could set in motion a more negat scenario than the forecast   with corpor profit weak  i m concern that the weak in busi fix invest  especi spend on equip and softwar  could continu for longer than the forecast suggest   but there are also risk that the combin s ulus could be stronger than we current anticip   we could be in danger of overdo it  result in a buildup in demand pressur in the futur   thus  go forward i believ it s  e to take more measur step  to remain forward look  and to convey the messag that the lag in the effect of monetari polici mean that the committe will have to temper it action befor the data actual reveal a strong resurg in econom activ   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   meet with our bank   s director  our small busi advisori council  and member of a local high tech heavi qualiti group  taken togeth with discuss with area ceo and report from our beig book contact provid similar insight about region econom activ   that is  despit the continu of relat good econom data vis  vis the rest of the nation  thing are begin to deterior in new england  current data about region employ growth and state unemploy level remain relat posit   new england grew over twice as fast as the countri as a whole from may      to may       and all state except rhode island have unemploy rate below the u s  rate   connecticut continu to have the lowest unemploy rate in the countri   but this relat benign situat seem pois to chang in a negat direct   initi claim for               unemploy insur continu to rise   manufactur product hour drop closer to the nation averag   and both print want ad and internet help want advertis declin sharpli this april  with some flatten sinc then   manufactur contact were consider more pessimist than even as recent as six week ago   larg high tech firm like emc and teradyn now report layoff   one ceo said that in his thirti year experi he has never seen such a sharp fall off in demand   small manufactur report that they are tri to hold onto the skill employe that were so hard to find just a few month ago but that if thing don t pick up in the third quarter  they will have to begin downsiz as well   some small firm  such as comput servic and firm that suppli seat for arena and school  report healthi condit   but other more direct involv in the high tech chain as supplier or outsourc are dead in the water  in relat term  the defens industri in the region seem in better shape than other manufactur   contact report littl cyclic varianc sinc defens contract    move to the beat of a differ drummer     to quot one sourc   nation  defens order are rise and  with the except of submarin

which is expect to propos increas budget author for defens  continu on a bit of an upbeat note  deterior in the loan portfolio of the region   s largest bank has begun to taper off and remain confin to larg syndic loan in particular industri like telecommun   addit downgrad relat to the as yet unavail snc data remain  but these bank also report strength in middl market and region credit   how long this will last  given the gloomier region outlook  is a question  howev               overal consum confid stabil in may at a level    percent below the previous year   new england remain more posit about the present than the averag nation consum but have sever downgrad their expect about the futur   similar  the busi confid index for massachusett drop to it lowest level in near    year  busi concern were more heavili weight in the present and less negat about the futur  though this was wide interpret as reflect a general level of increas uncertainti  construct continu to be the fastest grow job categori   residenti market remain strong  though the pace of hous price increas has abat a bit   commerci vacanc rate have jump  though most of the increas are in area like boston and cambridg  where space a few month ago was extrem hard to find   inde  one of the bank   s largest tenant who had been pois to move to get more space than we could provid decid to stay put and wait out the uncertainti   rental rate have fallen as well  though onli to level that are solid versus stratospher  accord to most report  in sum  the region seem to be slide  perhap rapid  from it posit abov the fray sever month ago into a downturn that more close resembl other high tech orient area of the nation   when ask if they see a turnaround  most contact repli    not yet      op ist are use this  e to train employe and to integr more fulli that last piec of equip or softwar they purchas  and mani report that their focus on product is as keen as ever  pessimist are not hard to find and they report no light at the end of the tunnel  turn to the nation data  there   s not much to distinguish our forecast for the remaind of the year from the  book   s   next year the rebound to potenti is almost immedi in the  book  while our forecast reflect a more gradual return   both forecast suggest that unemploy will rise to someth like       percent or so in      and that                inflat will level off if not declin  depend on the measur use   one could debat differ nairu assumpt  i suppos  and these are import  but for the  e period most relev to today   s polici decis  there is littl differ between the two forecast   the question is whether one is satisfi with this project outcom and what the risk surround that forecast seem to be  i must say that i   ve been struck by a sens of increas uncertainti on the downsid  this is not simpli becaus new england now seem to be mirror other area of the nation  overal  the data seem increas downbeat  particular as they relat to foreign growth  corpor profit  and busi invest   with regard to layoff  one cannot help but think that the other shoe may be in the process of fall  especi if demand   not strengthen a bit in the third quarter   if so  then the consum could well stop be the mainstay of the expans even with the s ulus of the tax cut   if peopl are lose their job  the tax cut may well all go to reduc debt or increas save  with littl immedi impact on consumpt   inde  i continu to wonder what a full percentag point uptick in unemploy   to spend and whether our model fulli captur that and  more import  if that outcom is desir in an environ of moder inflat   that would be rough anoth million and half peopl or so who want to work but can   t find employ  or about doubl the increas from novemb      to now   it seem to me that that sort of chang in a relat short period could have spinoff effect that are hard to captur  on the other hand  monetari polici eas has been aggress to date and fiscal polici will provid a further impetus earlier than expect   not everyon work in high tech and relat servic and temporari help industri  and continu layoff by these firm may not have the same broad base effect as the declin in auto and steel had late last year   in fact  i found the                paper ye day on the capit overhang extrem help in think about the situat and at least a littl reassur   there may be no    killer app     as the phrase goe  on the horizon  but after a year of declin in level of invest  small chang in technolog and increas final demand could spur further rate of invest over the next six to nine month   clear  the  book assum this will be the case  final  while rate of inflationari growth seem to have moder a bit and financi market seem less than accommod to excess  there   s still a need to consid how much polici eas is enough and when to step back   there may well be headroom now for a bit more eas  but i continu to believ that caution is necessari

thank you  mr  chairman    i ve comment for some  e that the district economi has been perform much like the nation economi  and that continu to be the case   the weak and problem are concentr in the manufactur and mine sector where activ is clear declin   labor market condit are eas  although net job creation remain posit   on the other hand  the construct sector  both residenti and nonresidenti  is healthi   consum spend has held up and tourism could probabl be describ as mediocr  no better  no wors  the one thing that has chang is attitud  which clear have deterior accord to the anecdot report i   m receiv   i think they   ve deterior princip becaus of what has happen in the labor market   the eas condit in that market  the layoff and job loss both region and nation  have captur a lot of attent and i think have convinc a lot of particip in the economi that inde the economi   s perform has stall or perhap even wors                at the nation level  my view isn t all that differ from the view express in the baselin forecast in the  book   i do think the inventori correct process still has some consider way to go  and as a consequ i expect the reacceler in growth to occur a littl later and initi to be a bit more modest than in the  book forecast   nevertheless  i am confid that a reacceler will occur and that next year econom growth will be a good deal better than it is go to turn out to be this year  i believ the risk at this stage are reason symmetr   of cours  it s possibl that the contract in capit spend could be more sever than we current expect or that consum spend could weaken as the unemploy rate rise   but it seem to me that monetari polici has larg allow for this alreadi and  of cours  we have fiscal s ulus in train as well   in ani event  i think we need to bear in mind  as i   ve said befor  the lag between our action and their effect as well as our respons to promot sustain econom progress by keep inflat and inflationari expect low
mr  chairman  i think our district s economi has weaken sinc the last fomc meet   all the inform we get on manufactur suggest that that sector  at least in our region  is continu to declin and that the declin may have acceler a bit in recent month   we also conduct a month manufactur survey  as   your bank  toni  and i m struck by the differ between your and our   all of the indic we look at in our latest survey  shipment  new order  capac util  and employ  were down sharpli in april and may   in addit to the general deceler in demand  the basic mainlin industri in our region  textil and furnitur  are also be negat affect by increas                intens competit  especi from china  which i think has been heighten by the strong dollar  with respect to consum spend  as elsewher in the countri new car sale have held up surpris well  but spend on non auto durabl good and servic has been weaker recent   one of our board member in richmond is the retir chairman of a larg depart store chain and he receiv a lot of data on depart store sale   he gave me some inform a few day ago on store sale in the first three week of june and indic that even when correct for promot program and so forth  sale were quit weak in that period  hous activ still look rather good in our district market   new home sale  as elsewher in the countri  have been strong most recent and new residenti permit are almost    percent higher than they were a year ago   commerci real estat activ  on the other hand  has weaken  district labor market have loosen further overal   actual  unemploy rate are down a bit in three of our jurisdict  d c   maryland  and west virginia   but in the state that have heavi concentr of manufactur activ  unemploy is up   that   s especi true in north  ina where the unemploy rate has move up from     percent last may to a littl over   percent this may  on the nation economi  i think the situat we face today is not all that differ from what it was at the  e of our may meet   invest in both high tech and in more tradit capit good is quit weak   but household spend still seem to be hold up better than might have been expect   on balanc  as the  book put it  there is weak but it   not yet seem to be cumul in the way that has character previous recess                at the may meet i talk about the current situat in comparison with the           period when  at least by some measur  the real fund rate was last at a quit low level   i argu then that if econom activ were current at a bottom  we probabl had enough s ulus in the pipelin   and in fact  the  book point forecast   show real gdp growth at or veri near a bottom in the second quarter without ani further eas of monetari polici   of cours  as we all know  in the forecast this bottom seem to result main from the monetari s ulus that is alreadi in the pipelin  the anticip addit fiscal s ulus  and the complet of at least a good bit of the inventori correct by the end of the third quarter   that s the  book point forecast   but clear  the tone of the  book commentari focus most on the downsid risk in the outlook   that s entir appropri  in my view  sinc we do have a dramat weaken in equip invest which  if anyth  could be intensifi current   given that downsid risk  i think a case clear can be made for further monetari s ulus   our action to date have undoubt help to shore up household spend in interest sensit sector   and that has probabl help to offset some of the cumul weak in equip invest   at this point  again by some measur  the real fund rate is at a veri low level   but it s not at zero yet   so there is still some leeway to bring it down a bit further  but frank  and this is the main point i would make  it echo comment that a number of other peopl have made  i realli doubt that addit interest rate cut at this point are go to do a lot to deal with the critic weak in equip invest   what i m hear frequent from member of our board and other busi contact is that a rebound in invest spend is unlik to occur until invest busi have some sens that the economi is at a bottom or veri  veri close to a bottom   so i think the direct s ul effect of                low real short rate on the economi overal may not be veri substanti at this point  which might tempt us to move rate even lower   but that could be a mistak becaus onc a bottom is perceiv to be reach  veri low real short rate may becom veri s ul  with busi pois  as i think mani are  to resum invest to profit from opportun present by the still rapid pace of technolog progress   so the risk  as i see it  is that if a bottom is confid reach sooner rather than later  labor market will still be relat firm and the inflat rate may still be drift up   i know we can debat that latter point but i don t think we can rule it out  and in that situat it may be veri difficult for us to revers field and tighten polici as quick as need to keep both inflat and inflat expect from move back up   thank you
mr  chairman  not a great deal has chang in the tenth district   our economi   remain sluggish  as it was at the  e of our may meet   manufactur overal remain in the doldrum   capac util continu to declin and plant manag say that they are still work with inventori that they feel are too high   firm are delay some of their expans plan but the dichotomi among firm is interest  reflect somewhat the contrast mention in ye day s discuss   a corn plant in oklahoma  which manufactur optic fiber  has delay addit to it capac for obvious reason   on the other hand  one of our metal fabric  while say that the manufactur industri is still in recess  report that they are begin to see light at the end of the tunnel   they are see some strengthen of order  so they are more op ist   that reflect  i think  a bit of the contrast in the economi  consum spend has held up better than might have been expect  but the outlook obvious remain quit uncertain in these  e   while there are some sign of a rebound in                consum confid within the region  we are still see some cutback in discretionari spend  especi in the consumpt pattern of some of our higher incom household  residenti construct has held steadi but the demand for hous  base on recent anecdot data at least  is show sign of slow   sale are down somewhat from a year ago  in most of our market the inventori of unsold home has increas and hous inflat in our citi has slow  especi in denver where it had been most promin   the pictur is much the same in commerci real estat   construct is hold steadi but there is some downward pressur on price and rent   again  denver is show some increas problem  part reflect their high tech orient  becaus level    one of the compani build some of these fiber optic network  has laid off a consider number of employe  the energi sector remain a strong factor in our economi   the rig count rose again in may and is at a new eleven year high  and drill activ continu to be restrain to some degre by a shortag of labor and equip for that industri   our agricultur economi remain mix  meat produc are do well and grain produc are do veri poor  as for the labor market  firm are find it easier than it was a year ago to hire worker   from high train it specialist to retail and other lower skill worker  the market has eas up   the unemploy rate hasn t budg a whole lot  though  especi sinc our last meet   the proport of busi contact report labor shortag has been about the same recent as it was in march   reflect the sluggish  wage pressur have eas somewhat in our area and overal price pressur also have remain relat subdu  turn to the nation situat  i have mark down my growth project for the near term but remain fair op ist  in line with the  book  in term of the longer run   i now expect the economi to grow at a sustain rate approxim the economi   s potenti by                the end of the forecast horizon   at the same  e  i ve becom more concern about the inflationari pressur that may follow   price pressur should be contain for the  e be   i recogn that the current stanc of polici has the potenti to push up the under inflat rate as we go forward  it is not surpris  of cours  that the outlook for the u s  economi remain pessimist in the near term  which i think still reflect some of the lag effect of tighter monetari polici and higher energi price from last year   and as we discuss ye day  i believ it also reflect a buildup of excess capac in import sector such as telecommun and technolog as well as a signific slowdown in foreign economi  in this environ  mr  chairman  our accommod polici has begun to revers the effect of our previous tighter polici and has had an impact on certain sector in term of increas demand in those area   it is not clear  though  that further eas can immedi revers the effect of some of the other factor that i ve just mention   of cours  the question we now confront center on whether we should eas further to better assur recoveri or whether in a determin effort to turn thing around we may be eas too much and therefor risk overshoot our longer run goal  i acknowledg that it is difficult to be patient in an environ of rise employ and slow growth but that  of cours  is what i am suggest here   i keep come back to the follow logic   by most es  the real fed fund rate is below the equilibrium long term rate  and polici is by that definit accommod  addit fiscal s ulus is in process and will have an impact on the economi later this year and next  monetari polici work with a lag  as other have said here today  which suggest that our recent eas move have yet to be fulli experienc  they will have increas influenc later this year and next   i admit that we don t                know if we are be too accommod  but the risk of that are certain increas   i m concern that if we follow a polici in which rate are set much below current level and they remain there over the next year  we risk over s ul the economi in      and we risk higher inflat in      and beyond   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my convers with offici at fedex and up lead me to describ the situat as be essenti unchang sinc the last  e i talk with them   my fedex contact said that the firm   s custom are expect flat volum for the next three to four month  fedex see busi as essenti stabil at the current level  the firm   s express volum is down about   percent year over year  but ground volum is up by about the same amount  that   s essenti the same kind of pictur my contact describ six or eight week ago   intern volum is still show posit growth of   to   percent year  fedex busi in europ is do well while that in asia is weak  on the labor market  fedex is not plan layoff but has built into it plan an assumpt of attrit  not replac all the worker who leav   but fedex is find that turnov is unusu low for the profession rank of the firm  it   s typic   to   percent and is now about half of that  accord to my contact    that suggest that peopl are develop some  concern about their abil to find new employ should they leav their job   blue collar turnov is also down   fedex report no difficulti in hire new peopl to fill posit when that is necessari   as with other contact  fedex is concern about health care cost   those cost are back to doubl digit rate of increas and that s a notic problem for them  the tone of the stori from up was a littl more pessimist but rough the same as the situat at fedex   up is reduc it capac somewhat by take some smaller aircraft                out of servic and also put some ground deliveri truck into storag   up report that volum in europ is hold up fair well and volum in asia continu to be weak  which echo the fedex pictur   up continu to manag it domest busi quit tight  hold the line on hire  use the phone instead of travel  and that kind of thing  my contact at wal mart said that the compani had seen some slight sign of weaker demand   i thought the firm   s analysi of recent develop was rather interest   wal mart has a mid month and a month end cycl to their busi   the month end cycl is tie to transfer payment that are paid out on a month end basi   that cycl seem to be a littl weaker but a normal pattern continu at mid month  which typic is the regular paycheck cycl   wal mart has note a shift in demand toward lower price merchandis in ani given line   in apparel  a line of shirt  let s say  the open price point  or the lowest price item in the line  has stronger demand than the higher price item   the situat is quit atyp   no one there can rememb such a larg shift of this type under condit of the sort that we have   custom traffic is flat to slight higher and there is a healthi mix between the total traffic and the averag size of a sale ticket   that is  peopl are continu to spend about as much as they had befor  despit this appar shift toward lower price item  my contact was question me on what i might know about the like effect of the tax rebat   i could onli talk at a rather abstract level but i did refer him to the      experi  which his peopl are go to be look at care   wal mart   s inventori are on the lean side and one of the thing they   re concern about is that if a notic pickup in consum demand materi as a consequ of the tax rebat  their store are go to be out of stock on some item   so they are debat about whether to step up their order   my contact said that the retail sector in general is fair lean on inventori  it s also true of their competitor   he made a big                point about medic cost   in his word they are    go through the roof     up    to    percent this year   the compani had expect increas more in the neighborhood of   percent but now is expect the situat to be wors next year   my contact said he is not see price pressur from vendor  but he note what he call a    latent desir    by vendor to rais price   that is  vendor don t have room to do it now  but with a pickup in demand they would want to put some price increas through   everyon is face with cost pressur that they are tri to deal with  let me offer a few comment on our current situat   i think the econom situat we face has mani uniqu characterist   it is decid atyp of u s  busi cycl experi   that mean that we don t have a lot of the typic pattern that help inform our judgment about it   the downturn has been concentr to an unusu extent in a particular sector of the economi  manufactur   i believ that real adjust are necessari in that area and they are be made   obvious  a contract is take place in the dot com and telecom industri  and that contract is go to continu no matter what happen to monetari polici  expect by those industri were too buoyant a year ago   those expect have not been met and are not go to be met within the next few year   so those firm are go to have to contract and they are contract  on a more general basi  i think earn expect and the stock market have been too high   the notion that earn can grow at    to    percent for an extend period of  e when the nation economi  at reason stabl inflat  is go to be grow at   or   percent   sn t add up   it  sn t fit   so those earn expect are go to have to adjust over  e   i m talk not just about the current year and next year  but about the longer run earn expect   probabl some adjust is go to have to take place in price earn ratio  by convent measur the stock market is still generous price   i call that a real                adjust becaus it reflect attitud toward the futur   it s not fundament a nomin phenomenon but relat to attitud about risk and the like cours of earn   in my view we probabl are go to see a continu adjust bring price earn ratio more in line with histor experi   that  sn t mean that p e ratio will go back to histor averag but rather that they will be more in tune with past experi  the staff and privat sector forecast of where the economi is go are broad in agreement   those point es  make perfect sens to me   there is no guarante  of cours  that we re go to get exact that outcom  and we have to be awar of the potenti risk on both side  hous continu to do well  as mani peopl have comment   i think that s import  not just becaus hous invest involv a signific number of dollar but becaus it is perhap the best singl measur of confid among those in the household sector  peopl don t commit themselv to larg mortgag  veri big financi commit over a long period of  e  if they don t have a signific amount of confid in the futur   i put a lot more weight on the actual perform of the hous market than i do the survey data on consum confid  the monetari polici background  i think  has been veri expansionari   money growth  no matter how measur  has been high for some  e  and we   re not talk about a matter of a few week or a few tenth of a percentag point   we don t have to quibbl about exact what it is   the staff document  of cours  report m    i like to add mzm to the mix of money measur  it is the definit that i think most close correspond to the friedman schwartz m  definit that produc a continu seri back to the  e of the civil war   mzm has grown    percent in the last year  it has grown in excess of    percent at an annual rate in the last six month   we                are creat or permit to be creat a veri larg amount of liquid   the largest mistak in u s  monetari polici histori have come  i think  from ignor money growth  and i believ it would be unfortun in the extrem if we  too  made that mistak  as for other measur  certain credit market are accommod   the amount of fund be rais is ampl  and firm that are reason creditworthi have no difficulti borrow through intermediari or direct in the market   the real feder fund rate is on the low side of es  of the equilibrium rate   ani way you cut it  it seem to me there is no question that monetari polici is in a veri expansionari mode   a number of peopl have comment about the lag in the process   a lot of the monetari polici eas has come relat recent   we would not expect to see it show up in real activ right away  i think the inflat risk are rise   i note that we have been count on declin energi price   one of the thing i ask my staff to do was to look at what has happen to crude oil futur for the decemb      and the decemb      contract   from them we see that the date when energi price declin will take place keep get push into the futur   i have a chart that goe back to the begin of       when the decemb      and the decemb      crude futur contract were both trade at about     a barrel   over the cours of      they went down a littl but they have been increas steadili sinc then and actual increas a good bit over the last year   so in term of where oil price are go over the next coupl of year  what look like a fair quick return to a per barrel price in the low    s is now more like to be in the neighborhood of the mid    s   i think we are in danger of build in some more or   less perman increas in oil price  and in my view we should not just take that out of our price index and ignor the fact that it s there                how the economi is go to evolv in come month is obvious go to depend on how market respond to the outcom of this meet   i think it s interest to note that the ten year bond rate today is about the same as it was in decemb of last year   i don t know of ani period in which the feder fund rate has chang by such a larg amount and there is noth to show  realli  in the longer rate   this is a veri unusu circumst   clear the impetus of monetari polici into invest spend is go to work at least in part through the behavior of long term rate of interest   and if monetari polici is in fact not press those long term rate of interest down  we re not go to see a quick respons in longer live kind of invest   invest spend is not go to respond to what we do  i think we ve gotten ourselv into someth of a bind in term of the market   s expect of where we are go   in my view the languag in our balanc of risk statement has turn out to be a forecast of what we   re go to do at our next meet   i think the market read it that way   if we look at the histori sinc we   ve use that languag  it has in fact been a perfect or almost perfect forecast of our action at the next meet   to me  that   s clear the way the market interpret it   unfortun i think we have a problem becaus if we say the risk are weight toward econom weak  the market is go to take that as a forecast of more eas to come   if we choos a neutral balanc of risk statement  though  i m concern that the market would take that as a forecast of noth more to come   to me that would also be veri unfortun becaus whether there is more eas to come or whether we will start to move in the other direct is go to be driven veri import by the inform we get in the come week and month   so i hope that somehow we can get across the idea that the current situat is not typic but has a lot of veri unusu aspect   this is a rather uniqu situat and we are not frozen into a cours of continu to lower rate  which would be my biggest fear   given my                interpret of how the market is read that languag  i would consid it veri undesir to have a balanc of risk statement weight toward econom weak   i think that   s just a signal to the market that there are sever more step of eas to come no matter what we do with the fund rate today   that would open us up to a difficult situat if it turn out that we feel compel to revers direct as the data come in   so i hope we can give the market the impress that our best guess is that we are now finish eas  but that we are veri open to respond to incom inform that might requir rate to be either higher or lower in the futur   i think we need to convey that there is no convict on our part as to the direct in which we will move the fund rate in come meet   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   befor i comment on the second district i would like to say that i think that assess of the market   s interpret of the balanc of risk statement is complet wrong   i believ the market look at incom data and tri to evalu what the feder reserv will do   that s what the market look at   to my mind  ani notion that what we say about the balanc of risk is tie to or determin our next move involv fall into the intellectu trap of post hoc  ergo propter hoc  anybodi who has ever studi logic has been taught that that is a great fallaci  as for the second district  we appar should have migrat south slight to philadelphia   wherea the scene of relat prosper had been center in new england and the second district  it appear to have move away from presid   and me   econom growth in the second district has shown distinct sign of slow sinc the last  e this committe was togeth   employ growth in the district has deterior sharpli   in new york state  privat sector job growth slow from a rough   percent annual rate in the first                quarter to a     percent pace in april and may   in new jersey  privat sector employ  which was virtual flat in the first quarter  declin at a   percent pace in april and at a   percent rate in may   new york s unemploy rate has held steadi recent at     percent  while new jersey s has risen from     to     percent in just the past three month  manufactur employ has continu to shrink at rough a   percent pace  in line with it trend over the past year   construct employ is up near   percent from a year ago  though it has level off in recent month   job growth in servic  and that s a lead driver of our region economi  has deceler in recent month but remain fair strong at an annual   percent pace   in the region s key financi servic industri employ fell notic in both april and may after rise through march   the disarray in the major secur firm is continu   you no doubt notic the profit warn from merril lynch   the firm on wall street that have a veri strong bond trade and underwrit capabl have done relat well  shift their profit realiz to that area from invest bank and equiti  consum spend is hold up reason well   retail sale appear to have pick up in late may and earli june with the arriv of warmer weather   but they remain littl chang from a year ago and are still okay but a littl on the sluggish side   sell price and merchandis cost are steadi to somewhat lower  and wage pressur in the consum area appear to be rather subdu   everybodi in the district  as we have been hear from other reserv bank presid about their district  continu to complain about the escal cost of health benefit and util  we have a shift in the balanc of prosper and lack thereof in new york state   the upstat area  with the partial except of buffalo  is actual look quit good   and the new york citi area  becaus of the financi servic industri  is look relat weak                 commerci real estat has deterior further sinc we were last togeth but home sale and construct have remain robust   the manhattan offic market has slacken substanti in recent month   ask rent are still up from where they were a year ago  but those rent are usual not be realiz  deal are be made at consider below the ask price  avail rate in downtown manhattan have risen from     to   percent and are go to rise further  in midtown they are up from     to     percent   so the bloom is definit off the rose in new york citi  the financi servic industri is a major sourc of tax revenu for both new york citi and new york state and  therefor  the fiscal situat of the citi and the state will certain be deterior   inflat level in the district are about similar to those of the nation   as for the intern situat  i think it continu to deterior   i believ    son   s report ye day outlin that well  as have certain remark this morn  on the nation economi  our bank   s forecast is about the same as the  book   s  so i won t quibbl on the detail   we have the same view that the risk are veri substanti to the downsid   i think we have to accept the fact that until we get into next year  busi fix invest will remain veri weak   so in my view our role as a central bank is to think of what we can do to keep consum confid about as robust as it is  which is veri necessari for all of our forecast   and with that  busi confid will at least not get ani wors and will recov with the benefit of monetari polici  fiscal s ulus  and relat subdu price increas  at the fomc meet in may  when we were last togeth  i had hope veri much that we would be abl to go to a balanc risk statement at this meet and at least paus in our eas   unfortun  i think the downsid risk is even greater today than it was at the  e of our previous meet   so i believ we have to continu to offer an accommod monetari                polici   but i do think we have to slow down it pace   if we were to keep eas at the pace of    basi point a crack  that would seem to be overdo it   that amount of monetari s ulus would seem to indic that we think the economi is even weaker than we in fact think it is  with the combin of monetari s ulus  which in my view should total     basi point by the  e we leav today  plus the amount of fiscal s ulus that we all anticip  the likelihood of our forecast be right is improv somewhat   but i think the risk still will be to the downsid   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   six month ago polici was veri restrict  as evidenc in the bluebook chart on the real fund rate   given the sharp drop in spend demand  we knew that the stanc of polici had to be chang dramat and quick   one could quibbl about the detail  but basic we made this transit and now polici is clear accommod   even a relat acerb critic like   makin is compliment the fed for be attun to realiti and do it job   and he has attribut the strong dollar part to the fact that we ve been more effect than other central bank  that was then  this is now   it s alway t i to know when and how to stop a prolong movement in rate  and we are face with that uncertainti   our job becom even more complic by what seem to be a real schism between the output forecast and the financi forecast  the output forecast have respond to this steadi drumbeat of weak data by lower their forecast   everi month as new  weak data arriv  the forecast write down the near term and push out the date of the bounceback   dave   point out ye day that revis to the blue chip forecast have been much larger than revis to the  book                forecast  but both set of forecast have basic follow this strategi   with the capit deepen link  the  book even write down long term growth rate   accord to project made earlier in the year the economi should alreadi be snap back by now  but of cours it is not   and at present  near term forecast look rough as gloomi as they did earlier in the year   this forecast strategi has also been follow for europ  asia  and latin america  in each of these area  spend data have been weak  forecast have been revis down  and recoveri date have been push back  but for the financi forecast  especi those influenc long term bond market  we encount differ behavior   as short rate go down  impli forward rate often go up  econom theori would attribut these rise in forward rate to expect of higher inflat  but frank  i don t see much evid of such expect either in direct measur of inflat anticip or in lead indic such as commod price or produc price   moreov  those who feel that anticip inflat is in some way relat to unemploy or output gap should be look for reduct in inflat  not increas  the analyst who make earn forecast are somewher in the middl   when the weak data arriv  they seem to revis their project downward just like the output forecast  they also push back their anticip recoveri date   but while they don t actual have futur earn forecast rise  they put in pretti strong rebound  not unlik the bond forecast  in some way these differ forecast strategi reflect our own quandari   if the output forecast were right  weak data could be view as weak data and we could take appropri action   but given the behavior of the bond forecast  there s a reason chanc that such a move would be met by no chang or even increas in long term rate and in the cost                of capit face those who invest in hous and other capit equip   we could take action  but our action might not reviv the economi much or at least would be strong dilut  there are  of cours  potenti resolut to this conflict   one is that long term rate are rise for some other reason  say  the lower expect that treasuri debt will vanish  but swap rate should not be much affect by such expect and those rate have been virtual unchang throughout the period of our rate reduct in       though they did fall slight last year befor we began lower short rate  anoth potenti resolut is that these forecast will come togeth   either the output forecast will decid that there is more chanc of an earli and vigor recoveri or the bond forecast will decid that forward rate should not be so high   one could think of mani other such resolut   in the end there may be littl we can do but pick our hors and ride it   to me the  book baselin forecast seem sensibl and there are plenti of downsid risk in that  earn forecast might get revis down again and the stock market might weaken   these earn disappoint and the capit overhang might dampen the rebound in busi fix invest   this  book forecast alreadi describ a rather weak economi  and anecdot evid of layoff  spend plan  and so forth certain has confirm that pictur   in this view  even though monetari polici has alreadi emphat switch to a postur of accommod  a bit more can be done to help reviv the economi   bond trader may dilut the effect of our action but they may also fall into line   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  the incom data have indic to me at least that it is still too earli to declar that the economi has                bottom   while we knew that the data would be weak  in fact they have been weaker than we expect   the gradual eros of the nation economi appear to be unab  the manufactur sector continu to face a daunt environ   with capac util at a level near match the low of the         period  this sector could legi  be describ as be in recess   more import for the longer term  product of high tech good fell sharpli in may and april  and industri contact suggest that inventori remain bloat in both the semiconductor and communic equip industri   and while comput may have hit bottom  that industri is unlik to revers it relat flat product pattern quick   ye day   s order and shipment data  while a surpris to the market  are quit consist with this general sens of relat weak in the high tech sector  as dave   has indic   import  while manufactur has been the center of this cyclic episod  the napm nonmanufactur index suggest the possibl that this weak may well be spread  evid from the labor market similar suggest continu weak   the most recent employ report indic that busi are still either shed worker in some case or ad worker at a much more gradual pace   in addit  busi are maintain hour of product and nonsupervisori worker at a level below that of the first quarter   week initi claim data point toward ongo labor market weak and  at the mid         rang  initi claim are at level not too dissimilar from those seen in       to be sure  there has been some good news   the hous sector continu to hold up well and consum confid appear to be firmer   but these are except in the face of main negat news   as dave   note and governor   just reiter  forecast in both the feder reserv and the privat sector have trim their near term                outlook   while most have faith that the economi will not have even one quarter of negat growth  i think confid in that relat favor outcom  at least for me  has been test with almost everi new piec of data   howev  as mani have indic  polici work with a lag and henc we must tri to discern the futur   unfortun  the futur is distinct murki and some factor are like to weigh on the economi more than the baselin forecast envis  in the busi sector  analyst expect a rapid rebound in earn   but given the ongo weak of the economi  it   s hard to have ani certainti that these observ are correct  should earn disappoint  as seem like  the appetit of busi for new invest may well be slower to rebound than mani current assum   and investor would see some further eros of wealth as well  which could weigh on consum spend  anoth imponder is the effect of the tax cut   it certain will add s ulus in the second half of this year and go forward   the question is how much  i think  and that is subject to some uncertainti   we can make assumpt about the margin propens to consum out of tax cut and how that consumpt will be divid across import good  good come out of inventori  and new product   but we must also recogn that while confid appear to be hold against a backdrop of rise unemploy and in the face of high household indebted  consum may be reluct to spend accord to ani pre exist model  final  in addit to the uncertainti inher in our own evolv situat  we should be mind that our trade partner might also be head for a period of subpar growth  just as with the domest forecast  weaker than expect incom data in mani countri have forc some mark down of foreign growth prospect   slower growth abroad in combin with a strong dollar is like to continu to limit export opportun   therefor  in my judgment  the risk remain distinct to the downsid                against this backdrop of a veri slow economi  i believ that inflat is unlik to be an import factor in the near to intermedi term  and that   give us some polici flexibl  while we have been aggress in our action to date  i think our challeng is to decid how to respond at this point   and given the ongo weak  i believ that we are like to find that our work has not yet been complet   as i said at our last meet  our goal is not to tri to speed up an invest acceler  which polici cannot do   nor should our goal be to stop a redress of imbal  which polici should not do   our goal  i think  should be to cushion the household sector and interest sensit sector as much as possibl in order to give busi a chanc to work through their inventori and to return to a period of growth in invest spend   should the bond market op ist  as governor   has describ them  turn out to be prescient  then we may have to retrac our step veri quick  and we should be awar of that as a possibl   but for today  at least  i think a bit more eas   seem to be the better cours
thank you  mr  chairman   the condit of our economi has been thorough examin by the other committe member   there s littl i can add to their comment  and in the next segment of the meet we will decid what all this impli for polici  so let me take a minut of the committe s  e to comment on a concern that i believ bear on our polici strategi go forward  i think it s import in today s situat to be mind of the distinct between the level of econom activ and the momentum in it rate of chang   momentum has been lost  but the economi continu to oper at a veri high level   to be sure  our measur of capac util is at a near recess level  unemploy is rise  and manufactur is veri weak                 howev  the volatil light vehicl and homebuild industri are hold near their veri strong recent high   person consumpt expenditur continu to rise  albeit more slowli   and while we have seen small net job loss in the past sever month  they are but a small fraction of the veri strong gain made over the past sever year  and most of those peopl are still at work  while unemploy is rise from it recent histor low level  there is a veri good chanc that it will not rise abov what mani would consid to be the long run nairu  impli that the labor forc would still be quit fulli util when this cycl bottom out   the stock market  despit a vicious shakeout in some of it segment  remain quit elev overal  in sum  one hope that this is the worst economi we   ll ever experi   and it would not be so terribl if it were just to rest here for a while   but it will not do that  which rais the question of momentum   the power upward thrust of the economi broke in the third quarter of last year when gdp growth came in at     percent and it has been slide downhil ever sinc  that quarter follow a year  from the third quarter of      through the second quarter of         when growth was     percent   the decompress of this declin has been pain and frighten   without have done ani research to verifi it  i suspect that this fall has been about as steep as that which occur in a substanti recess   yet gdp isn t fall  it just isn t rise  momentum is our problem  not the level of activ   will the economi regain momentum   it ongo strength  bol  among other thing by fed eas  the tax cut  and the conclus of the inventori correct  make recoveri the most like bet   but fragil confid  fragil financi market  stall capit expenditur  and mani other threat could readili kick us into a new further and possibl sever down cycl   so far the expect upturn is not in clear view and this ongo weak must be appropri address in the near term                as for myself  i remain confid that we will success deal with the loss of momentum   but i worri that if we are too success in do so  we could quick rotat into an overh problem initi by the high level of activ from which the regain momentum aros   that would be most unfortun  in my view  if it were to occur   in the past       year we have been through one major tighten and two major eas cycl  total some     basi point in polici move  disregard sign   while there were good and suffici reason for all this  in my view that is more than a desir amount of polici volatil over so short a period of  e   i am convinc that the economi   best in an era of small and infrequ polici chang  just as it   best with low and stabl inflat   i hope the committe will seek to find way to dampen this volatil over  e   when polici need to chang  of cours  we must chang it   but let s work veri hard to do much less  in the interest of make sure that we do not unduli whipsaw our economi and therebi perhap inhibit rather than enhanc our effort to achiev maximum sustain growth over  e  one further cheeri word on this subject   to ani other who  like me  worri about overdo this eas cycl  we may as well relax becaus if we are go to sow the seed of a futur inflat  i fear that we ve probabl alreadi done that    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to start by identifi three theme that summar my interpret of the outlook context for today s polici decis   first  growth appear to be at or below   percent for the third consecut quarter and there are few sign in the incom data of an immin rebound   this weak reflect a combin of a negat wealth effect on consumpt  a sharp retrench in high tech invest  the continu drag                from an incomplet process of inventori correct  and the sharper than expect weaken in foreign econom activ  second  sever forc are in train that should collect contribut to a gradual improv in the second half and a return to near trend growth by earli or mid next year  these includ the consider degre of monetari eas alreadi in place  the fiscal s ulus on the way  the check are liter almost in the mail  and the prospect for a period of declin energi price   in addit  a continu elev rate of structur product growth  mirror the continu rapid pace of innov and rapid declin in the relat price of high tech equip  should rekindl the appetit for high tech invest  third  this cyclic episod is uniqu in an import respect   in my judgment the slowdown in growth began with output abov potenti   as a result  if the consensus and  book forecast are in the ballpark  when growth return to near trend in       the economi will be oper close to full employ   this point is veri close relat to governor   s discuss that the economi  though it has lost momentum  remain at a high level of output   to be sure  there remain a high degre of uncertainti about both the sustain unemploy rate and the rate of trend growth  as well as about the  e and vigor of the prospect strengthen in demand   but it seem to me that an import implic of the  book forecast is that the upturn in econom growth may begin in      without the usual slack present at the start of expans   inde  we may begin      where we usual find ourselv late in an expans  close to capac  and at a place where we have to be particular alert to inflat pressur   chart    use in the staff s present on the outlook ye day illustr this third theme   it show that the unemploy gap was about   percentag point earli in this expans   the staff project the gap to be near zero as we enter                     now  the first theme evok a concern about the downsid risk relat to the baselin and keep on the tabl consider of further eas  at least as an insur move   on the other hand  the second and third theme are more forward look and suggest upsid risk  specif the potenti for overshoot   these theme point to a more cautious approach to further eas  some have dismiss concern about overshoot by note that ani risk could be counter by our quick move to tighter polici onc the economi show more tangibl sign of reviv   that logic   not entir relax me for two reason   first  i suspect that a quick revers of monetari polici is a lot easier when an eas is call for to partial undo an earlier tighten rather than the revers   in addit  while our job is to stabil inflat and output  not interest rate  there is some valu in avoid a pattern of excess sharp movement up and down in interest rate  let me comment now on how the excel staff analysi of the capit overhang  in my view  fit into the stori   it seem to me that the capit overhang stori contribut to both the first and second theme  the prevail weak and the promis of a rebound   the main sourc of the overhang  accord to the staff  is a reassess of the profit of produc high tech capit   this lower the target relat to the actual capit stock  potenti result in a capit overhang   the paper suggest  howev  that a rapid respons of invest and henc of the actual capit stock to the declin in it target valu has help to prevent a serious overhang  the stori   not diminish the import of the retrench in high tech invest in the current period of econom weak   a sharp declin in invest that has prevent a more serious overhang and the effect of the modest overhang that nevertheless have result appear to be import sourc of the prevail weak in demand   but the analysi   suggest that                ani capit overhang is like to be modest and short live and  therefor  unlik to be an obstacl to the project strengthen of the economi in the  book forecast  from the product paper  i took two conclus that help shape the forecast  first  both the board staff and the boston fed believ that structur product growth will remain elev relat to the experi from the earli      s to the mid      s   this contribut to confid in a rebound of high tech invest next year   second  and perhap more controversi  the board staff believ that structur product growth may now have deceler   at first i thought the project partial revers of the earlier acceler in structur product might be just a small wrinkl in the outlook   howev  it appear that this may be a more import part of the stori  at least if the staff is correct about the dimens of the deceler   the effect of acceler and deceler in product are  i would expect  symmetr   all the good news that come with an acceler turn into bad news dure a deceler   so whether or not there has been overshoot  and if so by how much  would have an import influenc on demand  equiti price  and inflat   in addit  the effect of a possibl deceler of structur product growth on the equilibrium real rate highlight one of the challeng perhap face by monetari polici in the recent slowdown   if there has been a deceler in structur product growth  monetari polici has had to eas enough to lower the real fund rate relat to the declin equilibrium rate   the aggress eas has achiev this   but if the economi move to full employ and trend growth in      as project in the consensus and  book forecast  the challeng to monetari polici soon will be to return to neutral   the extend bluebook simul confirm this view  two consider signific enhanc the prospect of maintain inflat under control as we move toward neutral  the project declin in energi price and the still low                capac util rate project to        still  how we set polici over come month will also be import in determin just how big a challeng the return to neutral will be and what the inflat rate will be when we get there
thank you   that complet the committe discuss and i turn to don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart in the    longer term strategi    section of the bluebook   in the current circumst  the question of what the committe should do today may seem more tight link than usual to some of the issu discuss in that section   the committe has eas substanti in a relat short period of  e  leav the stanc of polici by some measur at it most accommod sinc the earli     s  when the unemploy rate was much higher   and financi market particip believ your most like polici go forward will entail further reduct in interest rate follow not long after by a revers of a substanti portion of your eas  not a common pattern of market expect for polici  the baselin simul  shown on chart   follow page    highlight sever import implic of the staff forecast for polici strategi   first  given the staff   s assess of the longer run attribut of the economi  the stanc of polici is now accommod  in the sens that if the real and nomin feder fund rate are held indefinit at current level the economi will eventu produc beyond it potenti and inflat will rise  as a consequ  although there is slack in the economi at the end of the  book forecast horizon  it would disappear quick  and polici would have to be tighten at some point  on the order of       percentag point  to avoid have price acceler   the temporari forc restrain demand in the near term  though  are so strong and persist that the tighten can be delay for some  e without result in inflat rise from recent level  as you can see from chart   after page    the properti of the economi embed in the staff forecast and model are such that  to hold pce inflat around it recent rate  a path similar in contour to the baselin is deliv both by simpl polici rule  such as the taylor rule plot in blue  and by a more complic process  such as what we have dub    perfect foresight     shown by the dot red line   that latter polici is construct on the assumpt that the policymak has full inform about prospect econom tendenc  as given in the  book and it extens  and full knowledg of the dynam of the economi   given the current forecast  the policymak respond activ and forc to near term econom                weak  even in the knowledg that the fund rate is be reduc to well below equilibrium valu and will need to be rais substanti in the futur   in the context of this simul  lower and then rais that rate in a short period isn   t    overshoot      it   s a ration respons to the circumst  a respons that take full account of the forecast and  on the assumpt that the forecast embodi a correct evalu of the economi  will work better than other polici to stabil econom activ while keep inflat low   this polici both ration the prompt action we have alreadi seen and produc a substanti revers begin next year  although nowher near as pronounc as current anticip in financi market price  of cours  these implic are sensit to a number of judgment that form the basi for the staff forecast   chart   and   focus on a key judgment relat to your discuss ye day  the rate of growth of structur product   chart    follow page    examin the consequ of a prompt return to the rate of structur product growth of the last few year  in effect assum that the recent slowdown is quit temporari  interest  such an assumpt produc result for interest rate that look closer to those embed in financi market than   the staff forecast  particular so with the    perfect foresight    polici   with aggreg demand boost by the more rapid expans of earn and incom  the rise in interest rate need to begin sooner and to be larger than in the baselin to avoid longer run inflationari instabl  even though inflat would be restrain in the short term by better behav unit labor cost than in the baselin  in the experi run for chart    structur product growth fall anoth     percentag point  lead to growth in potenti output at a rate onli modest abov it averag of the     s and      s   this is the revers of the experi of the late     s and is accompani not onli by slower growth  but also by a much more unfavor short run relationship between the unemploy rate and inflat   the taylor rule and the perfect foresight polici  put some weight on both output and inflat stabil  allow unemploy to run abov it long run nairu and inflat abov it implicit target   just as real and nomin feder fund rate had to rise in the higher product growth scenario  with lower product growth they have to fall to achiev a short run balanc between these advers outcom  as these simul illustr  your decis about the fund rate today will depend on your assess of the under trend in the economi  the extent of the shock caus the economi to deviat from those trend  and the strength of the countervail forc of expansionari monetari and fiscal polici                suppos you see under product trend as like to be quit strong but not acceler and the unemploy rate therefor as need to rise appreci to get to a more sustain level   if in addit you see the restrain effect of inventori  capit stock  and household save rate adjust as level out soon and begin to dissip on balanc befor long and you view polici as alreadi suffici accommod to counteract the effect of these restraint on demand  you might want to consid hold the stanc of polici steadi at this meet   in the staff   s forecast  at the present feder fund rate  the econom adjust in train result in a rise in the unemploy rate that neutral the intensifi cost pressur inher in the cessat of product acceler   core pce inflat is cap  though at a level in      that is a bit abov it averag from      through        with expect inflat perhap alreadi near the upper bound of what mani member might consid accept  and polici need to be tighten at some point to keep it from rise further  the committe might see addit eas as tip the balanc away from risk of near term weak toward longer term inflat   concern on this score might be accentu if the committe felt that revers polici direct in an environ of moder growth and higher unemploy rate would not turn out to be near as frictionless as in the statist rule and model  howev  keep polici unchang would seem to requir a degre of confid that interest rate are low enough to fo  an adequ rebound in econom growth befor veri long  or at least that the risk around such an outcom are reason balanc   in that regard  the experi of the recent intermeet period of disappoint data on demand and downward revis to forecast may suggest that the risk to these forecast are still substanti weight to the downsid   soft econom data and reduct in expect corpor earn also have erod the market op  that seem to be take hold over the previous intermeet period  result in declin in equiti price and bond yield   and the downward revis in expect and their effect on asset price have not been confin to the unit state  rais the possibl that a weaken global outlook will imping on u s  export  especi with dollar strength persist   against this background  the consider surpris that would result in market were the committe to leav polici unchang could have quit a negat effect on attitud and asset price  damp the rebound in econom activ  the revis in econom forecast and market expect may impli that  in effect  polici is not as s ul or the forc restrain spend are somewhat stronger than you  and financi market particip  had anticip at your last meet   the gap between the actual real feder fund rate and the rang of equilibrium real rate shown in the bluebook may overst the degre of accommod now impli by the stanc of polici   for one  if the nairu is lower than embed in the staff forecast                the equilibrium rate will also be lower  and the economi will be abl to accommod a stronger rebound to a high level of product without generat inflat   in the staff model  the effect of altern nairu assumpt are not trivial  about     percentag point on r  for everi percentag point on nairu   for anoth  the feder fund rate in this exercis serv as a proxi for a broad array of interest rate and asset price along the transmiss channel   in fact  in this episod the dollar has firm and stock price have declin appreci sinc last fall   with some of the tradit financi transmiss channel block  the real fund rate may be overst the amount of monetari s ulus    in the pipelin     in addit  mani bond rate  while drop substanti last fall in anticip of polici eas  have risen slight on balanc sinc late march   the behavior of these rate appear to stem larg from the market   s view that the economi is pois to snap back suffici strong to requir a firm of polici next year   while you may want to give some weight in your decis to the possibl that these expect are correct  the potenti for a backup in bond yield should you eas   not impli that reduc the feder fund rate would be ineffect or counter product and should not deter you from take an action you otherwis thought necessari   for one  a failur to eas would probabl produc substanti declin in equiti price and increas in interest rate  tighten financi condit consider   in addit  were the economi to turn out to be much less robust than market particip seem to expect  long term rate would ul  adjust to the easier stanc of polici   in these circumst  wait until econom weak show through into lower long term rate and creat appar more recept market condit for polici eas would onli accentu the econom weak your eas would be design to address  if you thought that resourc util was like to be on a consider lower track than need to contain inflat  you might consid a    basi point reduct in the target feder fund rate at this meet   such a judgment might follow from percept of downsid risk to the staff forecast of demand  aris for exampl from the possibl of a substanti declin in equiti price  as earn disappoint further   or that judgment might follow from a sens that the staff has underes  the contribut of ad flexibl in labor market to reduc the long run nairu and contain cost pressur   a    basi point reduct would be a littl more than is now incorpor in financi market price   the best bet is that equiti price would rise  but the reaction of long term interest rate is harder to predict   even if they should increas  the net effect on financi condit of your action is like to be s ul   ani rise in real long term rate would probabl be a respons to an outsiz gain in equiti price  if the economi turn out as weak and price pressur as damp as the expect that led the committe to choos this option  ani increas in                long term nomin rate from higher inflat expect should be short live  if  howev  you thought that after your previous action this year the risk on econom growth and inflat were not so one side and you suspect that polici was alreadi close to suffici accommod to fo  an adequ pickup in growth  a    basi point eas would be more appropri   in light of the uncertainti  such an action would give you greater assur that financi condit were support of a satisfactori strengthen in demand late this year and earli        even if you thought more eas might well be need at some point  with real interest rate alreadi relat low  the committe might see substanti gain from shift to a more gradual pace to allow more  e to calibr polici to the emerg effect of earlier monetari and fiscal action  as well as the evolut of demand for capit good and pressur on cost and price   a    basi point eas would be less than the market are anticip  declin in stock price and increas in bond rate are like  but such movement would be limit to the extent that market particip did not see you make major shift in your reaction and intent  but onli chang the trajectori of eas and becom a bit more cautious   if the action and it accompani announc  howev  is seen as signal your intent to end the eas cycl at this  e and to respond consider less forc to unexpect econom weak in the futur  the declin in asset price could be substanti  whatev your polici choic for the feder fund rate  market reaction will be affect also by your choic of balanc of risk languag in the announc   at your last meet  sever of you remark that this meet might be  e to consid shift that languag to indic the risk were balanc   in the bluebook  howev  we assum that you would retain languag indic that the balanc of risk was weight toward econom weak   with incom inform still quit soft and suggest that econom growth stall in recent month  and with forecast insid and outsid the feder reserv be revis down  the balanc of risk seem to us still to be weight in that direct   in those circumst  short term risk of weak may still seem to be a potenti more import influenc on polici  at least for now  than longer term concern about inflat
question for don
don  in term of the press statement that you talk about at the end of your remark   what do you think the market s reaction would be to a statement that note the downsid risk but also indic that we might be finish eas  depend on the data that                accumul over the next sever week   i don t want to put word in bill pool s mouth but i   m think about his suggest that we say we   re inclin to wait with regard to judgment about our futur polici cours
i think there would be a consider reaction for the follow reason  market  although they have an eventu upturn in rate built in  also have    or more basi point of further eas built in   assum you accompani that statement with  say  a    basi point cut  they would be take out that other    plus basi point of eas   and i think they would also see you as tie your hand to a certain extent  as inde it would be your intent to do  in term of your respons to incom data   you would be say that the data could be weak and you might not respond to that  that you intend to be less activ in your respons   in my view  that would affect not onli asset price  bond yield  and equiti price  but expect as new data came in   how market will respond to new data on employ and sale and output would be affect becaus they would see you as respond less to those data   so i think there would be some immedi effect as well as a continu effect over  e
but don t you think there s a possibl that the messag is that if the incom data were weak  we would evalu that  especi if we had a balanc of risk statement weight to the downsid   isn t that just as like  or perhap more like  i think  to be the real messag
the balanc of risk statement toward weak would help take away from the reaction i describ to a certain extent  you ve rais a complic thought in term of how the committe might want to tri to nuanc it postur to the market   to make the market understand that you are chang your postur is go to be veri  veri difficult to convey in the press statement  particular one that we ve attempt to shorten this  e in respons to the                committe   s request last  e   this is someth that perhap the chairman might address in his tes oni  but i think it would be veri hard to do in today   s announc   i believ the immedi market reaction would be fair strong to a statement that rather explicit indic that you thought you   ve done all the eas you need to do
i have two question  don   but first let me follow up on the exchang between you and tom hoenig   at some point we have to back up our confid in the futur with action or lack thereof  not just our word
the bluebook   a remark job of put togeth a lot of option for us to consid depend on the assumpt we want to make   i know you can t put in    altern to satisfi all    of us  but you are get close   if i want to be a product op ist as in chart    then  of cours  i take serious the kind of caution that suggest   that by itself  on the basi of partial analysi at least  say that we might have to consid go in the other direct sooner and by more than under other assumpt   but i also believ that the labor market have been influenc in a fundament way by a sustain low inflat environ and by a pickup in product in technolog   so if i also want to be a long run nairu op ist and believ that the downward move in the natur rate is perman and not just transient  do those two offset
well  yes  though it depend on how much you would lower the natur rate   they wouldn t offset entir   if i may  i   d like to amend my remark to presid broaddus ye day  when i said that the tradeoff might be a littl more than one for one   in check with the model folk this morn  they said it was about one for one in term of a                percentag point of product growth and a percentag point on r  over a longer term  five to ten year  from where r  is now   so it depend on how you mix and match this   and  as i just note  in term of the nairu it s about one half point for one point   the long run nairu embed in these forecast is       percent   so if you thought the nairu was   percent  you could take     point off the equilibrium real rate  and that would offset to a certain extent the     point increas that we have in product growth   but you would have to have a rather low nairu  i haven   t done the exact arithmet  but a nairu of about   percent  i guess  to offset entir the effect of the higher product growth
my other question relat to the fact that i share the concern bill pool cite about growth in the various money and credit aggreg be extraordinarili rapid  and  of cours  histori suggest  whether it s relev to the futur or not  that to ignor money growth is at our peril   are you comfort in look at and understand those money number in a way that say they are not a risk
the money and credit aggreg tell me that we are not face blockag in the financi market   as presid pool note  credit is freeli avail to creditworthi corpor   now the spread  certain on junk bond and on margin invest grade credit  are veri  veri high by histor standard   so money is avail  but it s cost   the cost of capit has been rais for those borrow  but the money is there   and i think the committe s eas this year has certain facilit a restructur of balanc sheet  the volum of bond issuanc has been huge    corpor that can access the market have  been abl to strengthen their balanc sheet  and that s obvious a posit element go forward                on the money side  money growth has been veri  veri strong   some of it we can explain just by the usual respons to declin in interest rate  the usual fluctuat in veloc as opportun cost chang   but money growth is much stronger than that   in our analysi we thought some special factor were at work  such as mortgag refinanc and a few thing like that   in addit  our view is that the volatil and less favor perform of the equiti market has probabl led household to shift away a bit from equiti invest and into m    so there has been a shift in the demand for money   that shift by itself wouldn t suggest strength go forward  it s a shift in the demand curv   but onc again  like the credit flow  i think it suggest that there is ampl liquid out there  so financi concern and liquid concern shouldn t be hold the economi back   whether there will be a s ulus go forward more than is indic by the interest rate  i don   t know   i have some question about whether demand for money is stabl enough to draw that conclus   but i think it s support  it s help for sure
don  if i follow governor   s comment  he was tri to reconcil the appar inconsist between the expect in financi market of a veri prompt  quick  and fair substanti revers of polici earli next year and the consensus forecast for the economi
if i interpret chart   follow page   in the bluebook correct  the market expect a revers in short rate of about    or     basi point begin earli next year  that expect is overlaid with a consensus forecast that growth will still be pick up  and might not even be at potenti  unemploy may still be increas  and inflat  if it come                 may not yet have shown itself   are financi market tri to tell us that they see that degre of inflationari pressur out there and that they think we would respond that preemptiv to that kind of phenomenon
whether they re see inflationari pressur or real pressur i think is a veri difficult question   as some of you have remark and as we note in our brief ye day  it   s veri hard to pars the recent rise in rate between inflat and real rate   although the tip market tend to suggest that on balanc sinc the end of march there has been a bit of a rise in inflat expect  there   s veri littl corrobor evid of that   governor   himself note that there   s no such evid in commod price  survey  or in the behavior of the dollar   after all  if there were an increas in inflat expect  one would think that would not be a favor environ for dollar asset   that should be caus some pull back from invest into the unit state   but the continu strength in the dollar  though that   s relat to the realli poor perform in other countri perhap    suggest that peopl haven   t lost confid in the abil of the feder reserv to keep inflat contain at reason level despit what the tip spread might be do  so  the market may well be expect a littl more inflat  a bit more than they were anticip a few month ago when they expect it to declin  but they probabl reflect more a sens that activ is go to bounc back and that real rate will be rise   and i think market do expect the feder reserv to respond prompt   you   ve respond veri prompt    and    forc    as you like to say  with a declin in rate   and  gratifi  they   ve built in a certain symmetri to that   obvious  as a number of you remark  they seem to have a more op ist view of the situat than economist do both insid and outsid this build   but i do believ they expect you to begin to tighten and cut off inflationari impuls pretti quick
that   s help  thank
mr  chairman  i just have a comment  which is veri similar to what don just said   financi market particip do have a view of this committe  and it is reflect both in rate and in commentari   live in new york  one see a lot of these peopl and talk to them   they believ that this committe has great courag of it convict   the degre of credibl of the committe is extrem high   the market believ that what we   ve been do so far this year has been front load an eas of monetari polici  and they   re absolut convinc that when the  e come to revers that  we will front load the correct   i think that   s veri complimentari to the committe   i share governor     s view in that i wish we could get out of all this activ  and over  e i think it would be good if we could   but in my view what you   re read in the market is a combin of the fact that they   re a littl more op ist about the recoveri but veri convinc that when the  e come to move rate up  we will front load our action
i hope they   re right
shall we break for coffe   coffe break
it is clear that the economi and general expect erod further after the may meet  but in the last week or so there appear to have been some movement away from the unmitig weak that character a good part of the new inform earlier in the intermeet period   for exampl  the most recent data suggest that motor vehicl sale were hold up in june  at least through the first half  even though a signific part of that may reflect general motor    recent effort to get custom to turn in their                leas vehicl earli and buy new car   even asid from that  it seem clear that the auto market has been hold up  i think to the surpris of the motor vehicl manufactur   we know that home sale are do reason well and consum confid  although down sharpli  seem to be stabil at least temporarili   i want to emphas  howev  that these recent develop are not inconsist with a new wave of econom weak   they are type of develop that are short term in natur   we do have the chicago and philadelphia purchas manag    number  which suggest that the rate of declin in manufactur is slow   it is true that there was evid of that earlier  although our number did not show it and inde they still don t  the overal climat   seem to be a littl better after a period in recent week when absolut everyth was negat  but there is no doubt that the overal pictur is still quit weak  we are observ an import declin in energi price that i think is go to reduc some of the pressur on profit margin   price in the gasolin futur market are off more than   cent per gallon today   crude is down  depend on which contract one is look at  some    cent to a dollar per barrel   so we are see the demand for energi begin to eas in various part of the economi  and that is have a salutari effect not onli on energi price but it is probabl spill over into inflat expect  the yield spread between nomin ten year treasuri  i should say our synthet version of the treasuri yield calcul to obtain the same degre of liquid as in tip  and tip itself has come down a good deal recent  and inde the declin in that spread has pretti much revers the previous rise   core pce as es  by the staff for may is unchang   the most recent price trend are veri soft   there is veri littl in the way of price power in the economi  the major problem that i think still exist for us is essenti the one i mention at the last meet   we have seen veri dramat capit loss   these loss are weigh on the                system  and as best i can judg the effect have not fulli work their way through the economi  inde  they probabl have onli partial work their way through on the demand side   the crucial concern in that regard is the fact that  sit right on the edg of the third quarter  secur analyst have earn per share es  for the s p     that season adjust reflect a doubl digit rise for the third quarter   that is not at an annual rate   now that just  sn t squar with what i have heard from a number of peopl whose firm and earn number are in the s p       this lead me to question whether the sec   s financi disclosur requir  which as you know has prohibit the chief financi offic from give out inform select  may have had a major inhibit effect on the abil of corpor execut to communic to secur analyst   as i have mention befor  sinc these are not secur analyst in the old sens of the term who realli look at the compani and made their own judgment rather than reli on compani report  it may be that we are get some short circuit here   it s go to be veri interest to watch develop over the next sever week if we get some veri dramat declin in earn expect or  to put it more exact  when we get veri dramat downward revis in the secur analyst    es    i   m not sure at this stage whether that will have a market or econom effect  larg becaus it s hard to know what impact this sec rule is have on the system  the problem that we have is not that the economi is go to be a shade weaker or a shade stronger than the  book forecast   that s not what ani polici in this regard should be or is all about   it s basic the issu that i rais at the last meet   there is a low probabl  i would say    to    percent or mayb less  that we may get a signific weaker outcom than the  book forecast       point out that econom activ is still at a high level and that the glass is half full   in the other half of the glass there is potenti a veri long drop on the                downsid  especi in the capit good area   rememb  order and shipment of capit equip are just back to where they were in earli       when the reaction was euphor   they are well abov where they were  say  five year ago   and if the current econom weak feed on itself  the cutback in capit spend could proceed a long way on the downsid   i think the probabl of that outcom is actual less than it was in januari   if we look back at what was happen then  we see that the expans was weaken veri quick   the  book forecast has the economi as a whole stabil   that probabl may have gone down some  but it s still out there   as best i can judg in ani event  it s still a fair signific probabl  as bill pool mention in a slight differ context  we are in a type of busi cycl that we have not seen befor  and it might be use to think of it in term of it unusu characterist   in      and earli      we experienc a plain old fashion invest boom  the like of which we had not observ for a veri long  e   what we are see now is an economi that is come off that boom  hope in a manner that will gradual lead to stabil   my best judgment is that busi invest will come down in tranch   that is  it may drop  stabil  and fall further at a later date but not by as much   the basic issu here is that we don t in fact know what the distribut of probabl is  and i think that we face a degre of risk that we are not abl to assess fulli   if the data continu to show sign of stabil  then i think the  book forecast is the most like outcom   inde  i actual think that it has the highest probabl  as i note  i believ that discuss of whether gdp will be margin higher or lower are besid the point   i do think that if the economi begin to stabil  the current fund rate could be too low   i don t think that is the case  but that s certain a credibl view   the fact that we are below our es  of the equilibrium rate is exact where we ought to be in my                view   we ought to be below it   the issu is not whether we want to be at an equilibrium rate in a context such as this   i think the answer is    no      but the problem of have had this big surg in capit invest rais the question of whether we can maintain  as     i think quit appropri observ  a more stabl regim with respect to the fund rate as inde was the case in much of the period from earli      until the earli fall of        if we believ that monetari polici can stabil the economi when confront with the type of forc we are see  the implic is a high volatil feder fund rate that move against those forc on the upsid and in the other direct on the downsid   it may veri well be that befor this economi stabil we will get a pickup next year and in that case i think we will have to rais the fund rate   i don t think there s anyth wrong with move the fund rate up provid we re deal with an economi that has not stabil   when we were deal with econom condit in      and       for exampl  and we were keep the fund rate remark stabl  i thought at that  e that we had found the right equilibrium becaus there was no seem tendenc for anyth to veer off   the problem as we learn is that the longer we maintain a degre of stabil  the lower the risk premium becom   so there is a question of whether we have an intern problem in policymak  name that if we inde stabil the system for too long  risk premium fall  specul tend to emerg  and we face the type of problem that we ran into  that may be  and i suspect it is an inevit consequ of ani form of discretionari monetari polici   unless we go back to the gold standard or adopt some automat mechan  or conduct a black box type of monetari polici  i don t see how we can get around this problem   i would prefer that we keep the fund rate stabl as long as we can  but there are risk   so i don t think that move the rate up and down in and of itself is necessarili bad                i had hope at the last meet that we could hold at a   percent fund rate if the may  book forecast held   in the event  the forecast was not on target  thing began to deterior  specif  with inflat expect if anyth fall at this point  i think we can afford to reduc the rate anoth    basi point   i would hope that will be the end of it   and inde it should be the end of it if the  book forecast were to materi as we have been hope  the reason whi econom condit should stabil have been articul around the room  and i agre fulli with them   i think that s the correct way to look at this economi  the chanc of the economi acceler veri fast  more so than in the  book forecast  are veri low in my view   i think such acceler would requir capit good market to turn and move up relat quick   i thought the anecdot discuss relat to the capit overhang present ye day were veri use and inform   as i indic ye day  i didn t find the econometr veri persuas   inde  it seem to me  especi with regard to the non high tech area  that if the target capit stock was calcul that way  somebodi put wrong data into the equat   it  sn t work that way   and as i indic  unless we make the calcul in a rate of return context  i m not sure we can readili es   at least econometr  what the op um capit stock is   i believ it is quit conceiv that we have a much larger overhang here than the busi communiti know   the point is that there are veri great uncertainti out there  i would say that it s too soon at this stage to chang the balanc of risk statement larg for reason that don kohn elabor upon  i thought eloqu  becaus of the risk that the economi could get aw weak   i have no way of know this  but we may end up with a veri signific increas in the unemploy rate for june when it come out next week   we may be look at a second phase of this weaken economi  which would be a littl more                troubl than the one we have been through   i think that is a low probabl event  but it is by no mean a zero probabl  what i would like to put on the tabl is a    basi point reduct in the feder fund rate  and if we were to do that i would expect the feder reserv board to follow with a similar reduct in the discount rate   i would retain the statement of risk toward expect of further weak   if we move    basi point we will signal to the market that we are now in the process of complet our eas action   if we then do noth at the next meet  i don t think we would have a particular market reaction   at some point we will have to stop eas   what is go to happen as far as i can see is that if these latent data or signal we   re get that the economi is stabil actual materi  the feder fund futur market will adjust automat   in other word  we can go into the next meet with the expect of no chang in the market   that frank is my best es  of what is like to happen   forecast in period like this is a veri high risk undertak anyway   i do think  as was suggest at the last meet  that if we move the rate down    basi point  we ought to indic in our press statement that we have reduc the rate by     basi point sinc the begin of the year   that will signal that we think we   re at the end of our eas action or close to it   i don t deni that the market may react negat becaus we didn t move    basi point  but i think if we were to do    basi point today it would put us in a posit where we would not be abl to stabil this side of a   percent fund rate   as i see it  that get a littl scari frank   anyway     basi point is my recommend   vice chair
mr  chairman  to synops what you just said  we would eas by    basi point and we would have a balanc of risk statement that indic continu concern about econom weak   i complet agre with that conclus   and i                share the hope  probabl best describ as a fond hope  that by the next meet we can issu a statement that the risk have even out
i think your recommend is just right  mr  chairman   while i believ it is too earli to stop the eas process altogeth  i think it is import to send a signal that we are not continu on the path that we have been on   and in my view this propos balanc these consider just about exact right
i  too  agre with your propos   this is exact what i had hope would come out of this meet   in my view a move of    basi point  as you have note  is a signal   to me it also indic a measur of confid on the part of the committe that the central tendenc of forecast  that is  a bounceback by year end and into earli next year  is someth with which we had some level of agreement   there was a lot of discuss about econom forecast and the financi market   s forecast  but i think what the market are tell us is that they expect us to be forward look   and in that regard  as you mention  we could well see data in the near futur that are weaker than they have been  though perhap not weaker than we expect in our forecast   we just have to live with that and have some level of confid that the forc we think will fo  a pickup by the end of the year actual will oper   so i think this is exact the right move
mr  chairman  i agre with your suggest   i must say i do so reluct in one respect becaus i would realli like to stop lower the fund rate at the level                where it is right now   but the downsid uncertainti is still too high and the psycholog is still too fragil  so i think anoth  smaller eas move is the best way to go today
mr  chairman  i support a further cut in the fund rate to provid a bit more insur against addit downsid surpris   therefor  i would support your recommend of    basi point   i also support retain the balanc of risk statement weight toward econom weak   you mention that it would be desir to indic in the statement someth about the amount of eas to date   it seem to me that in addit to that we should make the point that those cut will have a signific cumul impact that extend beyond the near term
i don t think we actual have to say that becaus everybodi in the market know exact what such a statement mean
i think it is more power if we let them draw the conclus than if we draw it for them
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend as well   on governor   s point  i don t like volatil in the fund rate either   i would point out that if we were follow a hard line monetarist regim and the demand either for money or for good were bounc around  the fund rate would too   that  sn t mean that fund rate volatil is desir but i think as you said  mr  chairman  some  that is necessari when condit chang a lot   also  i would note that if we follow your recommend  it would be veri close to what the bluebook label the    perfect foresight polici      and how can we get ani better than that
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i guess the best way for me to put it is that i do not disagre strong with your recommend   i am concern that we   re make a littl too much of the incom short run data on the economi   earli in the year  as you know  there was a debat about whether the economi was go to follow a    v    shape versus a    u    shape pattern of reacceler   i think what we ve learn is that the    u    shape propon have turn out to be correct  at least so far   and if we are honest  we have to admit that we don t know how long the bottom of that    u    is go to last   as i said at the last meet  some patienc is go to be call for along the way here  especi becaus the logic of our polici is that we ve been eas fair aggress becaus we think it matter   so we ve got to give it some chanc to see whether in fact that s go to work or not   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with your recommend for the    basi point cut and for the balanc of risk toward weaker econom growth and i  too  hope this is our last move   i do have two major concern and they are on both side of this issu  one is that i  too  am concern  as you are  that there may be a second phase to this down cycl  i think it is a low probabl but in my view this action give us some flexibl and keep our option open go forward   my second concern relat to the long term impact on inflat and inflat expect   and i think this is a somewhat higher probabl   in light of the discuss we had  as you said  we must be will to move rate up when appropri  when this downturn stabil   as someon said in our discuss  i forget who it was  the market are expect us to move prompt and forcibl when that  e come
mr  chairman  i do not support the recommend becaus i believ that the balanc of risk statement will be read by the market as a forecast of more eas to come  as i read the balanc of risk languag  i think it is correct that over the next month or two the balanc of risk is genuin weight toward econom weak and higher unemploy  but the relev polici horizon is more   to    month out and over that horizon i believ that the risk are truli even balanc   in my view that s the right sort of polici horizon   if the incom data are weak  and that s not my forecast but i certain don t rule it out  none of us can rule that out  i think there s ampl room for the market to bring long term rate down   as i note  those rate have not come down sinc decemb   look at long term rate  if it appear that the economi is much weaker than we now see  long term rate easili would have room to come down     or     basi point with the fund rate where it is   i m concern that we are build in a problem for the futur by indic to the market  in accord with my view of how the market will read our press statement  that there is more eas to come   this is an empir judgment   it s not a matter of logic   it s my judgment or forecast of how the market is go to react to the statement   i suspect that the market will have anoth    basi point declin bid into the septemb futur  and that s a testabl proposit   in fact we re go to test it veri soon  i suspect  on the issu of inflat expect  i think it is import to understand  it s veri fortun  of cours  that inflat expect are hold steadi   that s a vote of confid in the committe   it is not a read on whether we have polici tune correct   it s a vote of confid that we will do what is necessari to creat that outcom  stabl inflat  in the futur   and i   m concern  take account of the lag that are inher in these monetari process  that polici is on an excess expansionari cours
thank you  mr  chairman   i concur with your recommend  with respect to the issu that presid  n rais  when incom data are weaker than we expect  particular when the economi is as weak as this one is or is grow as slowli as this one is  i think it s not unreason to react to them   if the data came in exact as we expect  i don t think that would call for reaction   what has happen is that they have been weaker   and if the economi continu to weaken  we may find ourselv have to act again   with respect to the languag  i happen to believ that over the forese futur the balanc of risk is toward econom weak  and our languag reflect that   whether or not the futur market build in anyth i think depend veri much on the data between now and the next meet
thank you  mr  chairman   given my view of the economi and the risk  i concur with your recommend on both side   i think it s the right thing to do to respond to the weaker data that we have been see and to recogn that there is a downsid risk   i also like the notion of recogn what we have alreadi done so that the market understand we are cogniz of the fact that in our polici action we have been front load  if you will  and they should expect us to take that into account go forward
mr  chairman  if i had my prefer  i would have stop the eas process by now   i would not go the quarter point   but  given your recommend  includ the third part of your recommend on signal that we are most like done  as i understand it  unless there is signific new inform  i can accept your recommend   i                would add that i would like to see more of an explan in our press statement  but sinc i argu last  e for a shorter statement  i will not push that point here today    laughter
mr  chairman  i support the recommend   i wish i could be more comfort with the balanc of risk statement   i hesit to reopen that issu even a crack   i hope that the signal effect of your statement will work   i find myself a good bit in bill pool s camp in have the sens that the market and mani of us perhap are read the  e dimens in the statement as a veri short term horizon   and if market particip translat that into the view that more weak data will mean more cut in the fund rate until the data turn around  i don t think that s the outcom we   re look for   i think we are go to have to come back at some point and talk about the  e dimens of the balanc of risk statement   but for the moment i support your recommend and i hope it has the effect that you think it will
thank you  mr  chairman   a year ago at this  e when we came into the meet we had the hope from the prior meet that we would not need to move again  we had made a    basi point increas in may last year and by the  e of our june meet peopl expect that we would move the rate up more   we hope that we wouldn t have to do that when we came to that meet   the outsid pressur and expect on us were that we were go to do consider more tighten  and we disappoint those expect   so  i was hope for a repeat  a mirror imag of that  in that after the may action our approach would be symmetr to the one we follow last year and we wouldn   t have to move again at this meet   but mayb the risk are not symmetr or the economi  i don t know   i do agre that we have to be as vigil to lean against boom as we do the subsequ inevit bust   when                we discuss the balanc of risk for the press statement  we make some remark that can have no possibl bear on a statement that s alreadi been draft   nevertheless  the risk that we see on the downsid are fair narrow and we have to worri about the risk spread   not all sector  industri  and region of this economi are in fact show weak  some are show remark robust   and i think we have to tri to be a littl clearer in the statement that some of us make  perhap you can do so in your tes oni  mr  chairman  that what we have seen  as you and bill pool have said  is fair uniqu   there is no weak in the auto sector or the hous sector  area that have been associ in the past with a weak economi and recess   therefor  our abil to respond to this type of weak and the risk involv is differ   moreov  we are not the onli game in town   we do have fiscal s ulus and we do have declin energi price   so there is a lot of eas in the pipelin
i agre with reduc the fed fund target by    basi point and with put the bias toward econom weak becaus i think that s where it is   i do think  though  that have to vote on the risk statement and then announc it is not serv us well   i think it s make our decisionmak process much more complic   so  i would hope that sooner rather than later we might consid not vote on a bias   if we just limit our vote to the fund rate decis  we wouldn t have to announc our assess of the balanc of risk   i realiz we can t stop announc it while we continu to vote on it   but if at some point you could just say that this is not work as well as we had hope and henceforth we are not go to have a formal vote on a bias  i think that would serv us well
i believ that we may be at an import inflect point for monetari polici   it s import today  in my view  that we at least deceler the pace of eas and signal that the consider degre of monetari eas in train is like to contribut to improv in the pace of econom activ   mr  chairman  i believ your recommend for a    basi point eas and a statement of unbalanc risk move in this direct   a case could be made base on the  book forecast for hold the fund rate constant today and recogn the downsid risk with a statement that the risk were unbalanc toward econom weak   you wouldn t have to twist my arm too much to get me to support that   but your propos polici recogn the clear downsid risk that remain  while at least signal a more cautious approach to further eas   it alert market that we may be at or near the end of an eas cycl   it make it easier for us to hold the fund rate constant at the next meet  while also retain the flexibl to eas further should the incom data point in that direct
okay   would you read the appropri statement for that polici
this is on page    of the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around       percent      and the balanc of risk sentenc for the press statement     against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk continu to be weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur
call the roll  pleas
chairman  spa vice chairman   governor   governor   presid hoeni governor   governor   presid   presid   presid pool yes yes ye   ye  ye  ye  ye yes  ye no
can we distribut the draft statement conson with this   do we have copi   this statement is written on the premis that the board of governor will move on the discount action   obvious  should that prove to be incorrect  we d have to revis this
do you want me to say a few word about the statement
go ahead  whi don t you
in respons to the discuss at the last meet  chairman  span thought it might be wise to make a few chang with regard to the statement releas after committe meet   one is to have a littl more structur discuss by have me introduc the statement and the think behind it word   second  we want to give all of you a littl more  e to read it and react   third  in respons to your request at the last meet  it has been shorten substanti   we did so primarili by refer to a continu of recent pattern  which meant that we didn t have to refer to all the piec of those pattern  just the main part  that was our think behind the second full paragraph   the statement   refer to the     basi point of eas to date  which was intend to send the messag that the committe                recogn that it has eas a great deal so far   there is no refer to    monitor care     word some market particip are look for as a signal that over this eight week intermeet period the committe will be on high alert to respond to incom data   so  that is not in there   and final  we tie the product trend and their implic for the longer run outlook to the statement about the balanc of risk in the forese futur   so there is a bit of a contrast between the longer term prospect for product growth in the economi and the shorter term risk for the forese futur
i guess the silenc could be replac by applaus   the silenc is pretti pleasant
i   m not so bold as to make that interpret
did we make it short enough so that there is noth to be said about it
well  i hate to depart  laughter  from this general satisfact  but i would take out that refer to profit and just say    declin busi capit spend     my guess is  given the trend in labor cost and so forth  that declin profit may be with us for a while   i don t know whi we   d want to singl that out
no  i think that s precis the reason we do   in fact it s a crucial element in the
well  but there are some interest issu involv  have to do with profit share and labor share  and so on   you know  it may be that all we re see is a return to more normal   i guess that is my thought
yes  but even if that s true  if that argument were valid today  it would have been valid at the last meet and the meet befor
well  i was go to rais it at our last meet    laughter
there   s a statut of limit    laughter
well  i don t know   is there a law that say onc profit is in here it has to stay forev
no   frank  take it out at this particular stage i think creat more potenti problem than leav it   becaus this word is almost ident to what we   ve said in the past
okay  i will find that a compel argument   but i would also hope that at some point we can find an excus to get it out of there
yes  when profit start go up    laughter
mayb even befor then
is that all right with everybodi  can we go into recess and have the board of governor meet in my offic   we will be back to report on that deliber   recess
the board of governor vote to lower the discount rate by     percentag point   we will continu by conven a board of governor meet to discuss the lombard rate  but everybodi here is go to be particip in that discuss and we will do it over lunch   so whi don t we adjourn  get our lunch  and then   madigan will start us off with a brief on the lombard rate issu   the next fomc meet  incident  is august
let me remind you that ani revis to your individu forecast should be submit to dave   by juli
let   s adjourn  get our lunch  and come back into this meet room  end of meet
