would somebodi like to move approv of the minut of our novemb  th meet
is there a second
without object  they are approv   mr  kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were distribut to you this morn   the top panel on the first page show u s  and euro area cash and forward rate   the   month u s  dollar deposit rate  the solid red line  is littl chang sinc your last meet and as you can see the   month forward rate larg track the cash rate   but the   month deposit rate   month forward  the red line with narrow dash  reflect the volatil of expect in the past month  first  the   month forward rate move upward after releas of the stronger than expect retail sale report on novemb   th   then it declin about     percentag point after the novemb   th michigan confid report was weaker than expect and comment by governor   were perceiv as keep the door open for a further eas of polici   subsequ  on decemb  th  that rate rose again after the nonmanufactur napm index  an indic that general receiv littl notic  rose sharpli and heighten expect for a near term recoveri   friday   s weak employ report did not alter the op  that is built into forward rate   that leav the market in a somewhat unusu posit of have price in a bit more eas in the near term  inde    out of    primari dealer expect an eas at this meet  but then an aggress tighten begin some  in the second half of         the chart use by mr  kos are append to this transcript             in the euro area the ecb reduc polici rate by    basi point on novemb  th  two day after the fomc action  and cash rate  shown in the solid   line  have been stabl sinc then   forward rate fluctuat most in respons to u s  data   on balanc  the market expect that short term rate probabl will declin by anoth    to    basi point over the next few month  as you can see in the bottom panel  interest rate in japan remain veri low   the discuss in japanes financi circl is about what further step the bank of japan  boj  can take to make polici even more accommod   so one might ask whi forward rate are begin to drift higher   the answer is not fulli clear   certain  there is no expect that the boj will abandon it zero interest rate polici ani  e soon   one possibl  and i stress it   s onli a possibl  is that forward rate agreement  which are oblig of bank  are begin to reflect a credit risk premium that is not show up  at least not yet  in other money market instrument  turn to page    the chart on the top half of the page depict the volatil of treasuri yield over the past    day   the top left panel graph the   year yield along with the target fed fund rate   the top right panel graph the     and    year yield   in general  these yield move in veri much the same pattern as the   month forward rate i mention earlier   they rose in earli novemb becaus of op  about the economi  retrac that rise as the op  cool  and then spike higher despit data on some day  such as friday   s weak labor market report  that would typic be associ with lower  not higher  interest rate   on balanc    year yield have risen a bit more than     percentag point over the intermeet period and the spread between the   year note and the fed fund rate has risen to     basi point  the largest this year   yield on    year and    year treasuri rose about    basi point  the complaint from market particip about volatil can be support by the data in the bottom chart on page     the red line is the volatil of daili yield chang in the   year note  measur in basi point on the left scale  sinc februari        fluctuat have been smooth by use a    day move averag   in general  dure most of that period this measur of volatil move in a rang of   to   basi point and usual between   and   basi point  recent  the volatil of the   year note was as high as   basi point  that level had been approach briefli a coupl of  e in the mid     s and was exceed onli in the late     s   the chart also graph the target fed fund rate over the same period   the relationship between the two rate is not perfect  but casual observ suggest that spike in volatil are frequent associ with anticip of the end of a monetari polici cycl or are coincid with the begin of a new one   for exampl  the volatil spike in      occur at end of the earli     s eas cycl and the      spike coincid with the tighten cycl that began in februari of that year   again  the relationship is not precis and i don   t want to make too much of it   nevertheless  it is possibl            that at least some of the volatil in recent week reflect indic that the bond market is begin to adjust to expect that the forward market are take more serious  name that this cycl is near a conclus  anoth question is whi have yield on coupon secur risen so high  expect about econom recoveri are certain part of the stori   the ralli in the equiti market suggest that this factor is at work there as well   but it is difficult to explain the scope and speed of the move by that explan alon  the second factor at work may have been posit among dealer  specul fund  and other investor   a number of strategi involv go long in treasuri bond  especi at the short end of the curv   this work fine for most of the year  but the trade attract mani imit and creat ingredi for a pronounc effect if everyon were to head for the door at the same  e   third  corpor suppli has continu at a rapid pace   and a fourth factor cite recent is the reput impact of hedg by larg mortgag investor   with rate rise  mortgag investor tend to sell treasuri to maintain their durat target  a point i   ll talk about a bit more in a minut  final  there may have been a calendar effect   novemb   th is the fiscal year end for a number of larg invest bank and decemb   st the year end for almost everyon els   with dealer scale back posit and individu trader protect their bonus  it was not an opportun  e to have larg demand for liquid from both investor and hedger on the same side of the market   ul   the dealer communiti absorb this suppli but onli with a larg price adjust   perhap ani one of these reason alon would not explain the fluctuat we   ve observ  but a shift in percept  a posit overhang  a price insensit group of hedger  and a risk avers dealer communiti came togeth at a delic point in  e  the fourth factor i mention was the import of the mortgag market  that market has grown substanti in recent year  increas influenc the treasuri market   the top panel on page   graph the outstand suppli of public held treasuri and the outstand suppli of mortgag back secur  mbs    five year ago the treasuri market was twice the size of the mbs market   now the two are converg   and if one take a broader definit of the mbs market  it size is bigger still  the bottom panel graph the yield on the    year treasuri note and the es  durat of the aggreg mbs market from septemb  th to decemb  th of this year   i should stress that this is an es  by one invest bank and differ assumpt regard prepay speed could chang the durat  though the overal pattern should be similar   when yield fell in septemb and octob the durat of mortgag back secur also fell  as prepay rose and investor receiv cash flow sooner than expect   in that environ  asset manag will buy treasuri or swap to maintain their durat target   even if the hedg is via swap  ul  swap dealer will hedg themselv with treasuri and the net result will be            the same   when treasuri yield rose in novemb  the durat of mortgag back secur  shown in the blue line  rose sharpli   follow their model in such circumst  larg mortgag holder sell treasuri  which contribut to rise rate  which in turn extend the durat of mortgag portfolio and lead to more sell until the process final dissip  becaus mortgag portfolio are manag against a durat benchmark and becaus hedg behavior is driven by similar model  asset manag will to some extent be price insensit   if the volum of those sale or purchas is larg enough  given the set of liquid condit  it could influenc price in way that are counterintuit to new piec of inform   that may have been the case last friday when the weak labor report was follow by higher  not lower  yield   final  given the swift with which american homeown refin mortgag in respons to lower yield  mortgag back secur are becom more concentr in fewer pool than in the past   and this impli that as a mortgag pool get closer to the point where refinanc is econom advantag  the impact of relat hedg will be larger   as of novemb   th  mortgag back secur pay coupon of       to   percent repres    percent of the entir outstand mbs market  turn to page   and the corpor market  the top panel graph the spread between a and aaa corpor bond and also the spread between bbb and aaa corpor oblig   on balanc  spread were relat stabl despit the continu larg suppli and the enron bankruptci  the bbb spread rose slight while the a spread narrow   the spread of high yield bond to treasuri  not shown here  actual narrow from     basi point to     basi point  the bottom panel depict chang in commerci paper spread as the year end approach   the red line show the a  p  minus a  p  spread for             the   line is the spread for           and the blue line is the spread for the current year to date   on the left side are the    day spread and on the right side the    day spread   both the     and    day spread widen earlier this fall after      but actual have begun to narrow more recent   and both are narrow than in the compar period last year   one reason  and perhap the main reason  is that the a  p  sector has shrunk substanti as mani a  p  compani exit their cp program and instead issu longer term oblig  generat breath room but also increas their interest cost  turn to page   and develop in japan  the top panel graph the dollar yen exchang rate sinc septemb  rd   the dollar has been appreci gradual sinc the boj   s late septemb intervent and the close of the japanes fiscal half year   in part  the yen   s depreci may be due to the perform of the japanes economi  which has deterior  with few forecast look forward to a strong recoveri in                  recent the dollar yen exchang rate has also been influenc by a boi   if some  confus  debat in tokyo about the boj   s

foreign bond  the reserv impact in yen is the same   while step up purchas of jgbs may add more liquid and weaken the yen  buy foreign bond is view as a more direct way to influenc the exchang rate   henc  the foreign exchang market is monitor this veri close for sign as to whether monetari polici and more tradit foreign exchang intervent will be converg   ad confus to this mix is uncertainti about the u s  respons to the idea  newspap stori have suggest that the administr favor it  or more subt that a weaken yen would be accept as part of the broader effort to counteract deflat in japan  the middl panel show the    year jgb yield over that same period  jgb yield have stay low despit recent downgrad of japan   s debt by both moodi   s and s p and despit the talk about the bank of japan

debt problem deterior still more  final  let me say a word on domest reserv manag   sinc the last meet we have been build up our hold of long term rps to help meet need associ with the season growth in currenc   we expect that currenc will have increas about     billion from it late octob level to it peak in earli januari befor begin to unwind   over this rough two month period  our hold of    day rps will have risen a net of about    billion and are expect to peak at     billion or so befor revert to the low     billion rang by some  in februari  mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will nee  approv of our domest oper  and i will be happi to take question
i   ve been hear talk in the last week to ten day or so about this issu concern whether or not we  the unit state govern  approv of this notion that has surfac in tokyo of purchas of long term u s  treasuri by the bank of japan   we are the govern   what in fact is our opinion on this issu   i guess we   re not the govern    laughter             i know of no offici who has made ani comment  certain not public   has anybodi spoken to the treasuri   there are onli two possibl sourc  larri   at the white hous or   taylor at the treasuri   i haven   t spoken to them about this issu   has anybodi
i have had convers with lower level offici of the treasuri   the view have been somewhat vagu in the sens of suggest that if the yen goe down becaus of action taken to s ul the economi  that   s one thing   but if there   s a deliber attempt to weaken the yen  that would be anoth
well  how in the world can you distinguish between purchas for one reason or the other
absolut  that   s the difficulti
mayb i   ll ask somebodi the question   i won   t have to ask you  though i may have gotten a clearer answer out of you than i will from them    laughter  i find this correl between the    year treasuri yield and durat in the mortgag back secur market bizarr   it   s not a correl that one normal see  it   s one we see onli when one of the variabl depart from the other   i look at these week jiggl or daili jiggl that are occur and i wonder what this correl would look like if you went back to befor septemb    the first observ on your chart
i haven   t look at that   one should look at it over a decad or so and we haven   t look at it back that far   but i think  and this is onli a hypothesi  this correl has been get tighter over  e and the reason relat to the trend depict in that top chart on page     that is  the mortgag market has been get bigger and there are more method for hedg and manag the mortgag book   as mortgag book first of all becom concentr  and there are some veri            larg holder of mortgag out there  and as model becom similar  the impact is greater both becaus of the size and the techniqu
in the studi the chang has not been that great in the last few month   what would happen if you went back to the spring   do you have ani idea
i don   t  but that is work we will do
my problem is that when i see somebodi publish a chart like this i know the earlier data don   t fit becaus if they did  the produc of the chart would show them   laughter
i haven   t look at that
mr  chairman  they are high correl becaus they are function relat   the prepay speed is a function of the level of mortgag yield  and given the close relationship
yes  i know that   sure
right   and if you look at a short period where there hasn   t been much chang in the under pool of mortgag  that function is go to show up as much closer   if you stretch this back over  e  where there is a bigger divers in the outstand pool of mortgag  then the correl will be chang   so i think you   re right   if you take a snapshot  a relat short window  they are go to be high correl becaus basic you are look at prepay speed for a given set of mortgag that all have similar coupon
clear  the    year treasuri note is a crucial element in the calcul of the option adjust durat
exact   it   s a crucial element given the net extent of the distribut of mortgag   in a relat short period of  e  the distribut of mortgag isn   t chang so you            realli see the function   over  e  as the distribut of mortgag chang  as some age and as prepay occur  then you   re go to see a weaker relationship   so when dino and his colleagu go back and examin this  they   ll see a shift relationship   in ani short window  though  you   ll see a relat close one
further question for dino
i move approv of the domest oper
without object  they are approv   we   ll now move to the econom situat       oh  today it   s a    doubl          is back
i hope your mother is do well
yes  she is  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the data that we have receiv over the past month present the usual up and down for us to contend with   but befor i discuss the detail of our interpret of that news  i thought i would take this rare opportun to make the case that  at least in broad term  event are unfold just about as we had anticip   in labor market  employ has been fall at a rapid clip in recent month  and the unemploy rate is on a steep upward trajectori   as we had expect  the manufactur sector is bear the brunt of these cutback in job  and factori output has continu to drop   overal activ appear like to have contract at a moder pace in the fourth quarter  led onc again by a sizabl liquid of inventori and ongo declin in capit spend   these were all import featur of our novemb project  in write down our near term forecast  we were influenc import by read on the labor market and by the avail product indic   for the second consecut meet  we receiv a month labor report onli two day after we publish the  book   for have devis that meet schedul  mr  kohn  your good secretari  will not be receiv a holiday gift from the  research divis this year    laughter   to be sure  don was  as usual  attent to the need of the committe by enabl your access to these import data befor the meet   but the schedul also virtual ensur maximum embarrass to those of us on the forecast staff             in the event  the surpris in last friday   s report were less embarrass than those of a month ago   the unemploy rate rose to     percent last month  a steeper rise than we had anticip   and  after declin near         in octob  privat payrol tumbl an addit         in novemb   we had been expect a drop of about           but the report present some posit for us as well   the workweek rose  and total product worker hour did not drop as much as we had been look for   all in all  it was a weak report   but it probabl was not as weak as some of the headlin figur would suggest and  on balanc  it was not materi differ from our expect  the event of septemb    continu to cast a shadow on the labor market   job loss were onc again sizabl in the airlin industri  and level of employ in area such as hotel and amus remain depress   not surpris  the hire of secur guard has been brisk  but this provid onli a small counterweight to loss elsewher   health care is the onli major sector in which job growth appear to have been unaffect by the econom downturn this fall  the most promin featur of novemb   s labor market report was the continu extraordinari weak in manufactur and relat industri  manufactur shed more than         worker last month  while help suppli job drop near        and wholesal trade employ declin         although the falloff in employ and hour might suggest anoth veri larg drop in industri product in novemb  we are expect onli a modest declin  perhap down about     percent for the month   the reason is that  in a number of area where hour declin signific  we have more reliabl measur of physic product that show greater strength   still  assum anoth moder drop in decemb  ip will be off at near a   percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  veri close to the weak perform that we had anticip at the  e of the last meet  this conclud the self congratulatori portion of my remark  and i shall now return to a more familiar motif character by a combin of confess and excus   there have been some develop in the incom data that have had import implic for our forecast go forward   while product and labor market indic have been come in close to our expect over the past month  we have been consist surpris by the strength of the read on final demand   sale of new motor vehicl remain much stronger in novemb than we had anticip  even make allow for the extens of the recent incent program   retail sale outsid of auto bounc back more sharpli in octob than expect  as did the consumpt of servic   new home construct and sale have also exhibit greater resili than we had expect   in the busi sector  shipment of capit             good move up on balanc in octob  and the rebound in new order was even more pronounc  these read have present us with an especi challeng signal extract problem   in almost everi case  the rebound in octob follow a sharp drop in the preced month that was  at least in part  relat to the event of septemb      in most of these area  we had anticip some improv  but one that was stretch out over a few month   the octob increas might just indic that we had the  e wrong   altern  the data could be signal that under final demand is stronger than we had been think   true to form  our econometr and statist filter model suggest that the best interpret is probabl a littl of both  a quicker snapback and stronger under demand   and  for the most part  that is how we have construct the near term forecast  we have revis up the growth of final sale in the current quarter  but not by the full extent of the octob surpris in the spend data  the incom data have led us to alter one other import aspect of our forecast   we no longer expect an appreci further hit to consum confid stem from the event of septemb      as i note last month  the extraordinari strength in car sale had given us paus about this element of our project  and that concern intensifi over the past few week   both the continu firm of the avail measur of consum confid and the actual strength we have observ in household spend led us to remov most of the restraint we had impos on our consumpt forecast in anticip of a serious retrench in confid  taken togeth  these chang have led us to mark up our project of final sale to show a   percent annual rate of increas in the fourth quarter rather than the       percent rate of declin that we had project a month ago  becaus we don   t see correspond strength in product  we have revis up our forecast for the growth of real gdp onli a bit  from a drop of     percent in the last  book to a declin of     percent in our current forecast  obvious  this forecast requir a much sharper liquid of inventori to reconcil the dispar revis we have made to the near term outlook for spend and for product   in the case of motor vehicl  we have some hard evid suggest that this is  in fact  occur   but outsid of motor vehicl  our project of a     billion annual rate runoff of inventori in the fourth quarter is still larg forecast  not fact  these revis also have implic for the dynam of the economi as we move into next year   the combin of more upward momentum in final sale and deeper inventori liquid suggest the likelihood of greater impetus to product in the come month   that ad impetus is obscur a bit in our forecast becaus we push back by a coupl of month the second round of tax rebat assum in our fiscal packag   but we would character our             forecast as one in which the economi will be enter      on a stronger note than we thought like a month ago  in that regard  there are some notabl upsid risk to this outlook   a signific further posit surpris to sale could caus firm to revis up their plan for product both quick and sharpli to meet higher sale and to rebuild deplet buffer stock   sign that materi price could be firm  such as have been appar in commod market in recent week  would provid further incent for these action   with the stanc of monetari polici remain quit accommod  fa  sale growth might also lead firm to retriev capit spend plan that had earlier been shelv   add in some knock on multipli acceler effect  and the economi could pick up a stronger head of steam next year than we have anticip  clear  particip in financi market appear to be expect a more ebulli outcom than is incorpor in the staff forecast   the increas in rate impli by fed fund futur  the declin risk spread  and the rise in the stock market over the past few week suggest that a consider shift in sen ent about the economi has occur over the past month or so   i   ll admit that my jaw has drop on a coupl of occas at the extent to which rate have move all along the yield curv in appar respons to data that we do not see as have especi high inform content   the non manufactur purchas manag    report and the preliminari michigan survey certain come to mind   but  i don   t think the signal from the financi market should be ignor entir either  we made an attempt in the  book to gaug how larg a revis in the econom outlook would have been requir to generat the shift in the path of the expect fund rate that we have observ between fomc meet  needless to say  that exercis should be taken with an ampl grain of salt   the result suggest that financi market particip have like revis up their outlook signific  but the size of that revis   not seem implaus  so whi haven   t we share fulli the market   s enthusiasm for incom inform about the economi   i have alreadi note that we are a bit leeri about read too much into what must be consid still veri tentat improv in the spend data   moreov  we still see consider drag on activ go forward   even allow for the recent improv in the stock market  the deterior that has occur in household net worth over the past year and a half seem like to restrain household spend and keep the save rate on an uptrend over the next year or so   in addit  our earn forecast   not provid much encourag for further strong gain in the stock market   and  while we can   t rule out a fa  recoveri in invest spend  we are hear few report yet of a signific chang in busi sen ent regard capit spend   final  we do not expect the rest of the world to provid much s ulus to activ in the unit state              inde  we see a few conspicu downsid risk to our project   the stock market is one   the equiti premium implicit in recent stock valuat has again gotten mighti low   it is not difficult to imagin a disappoint similar to that which occur last summer if the recoveri is weaker next year and earn fail to rebound with the vigor current anticip in the market   we remain worri about the possibl fragil of consum spend in come month   with the labor market continu to weaken  consum may at some point pull in spend plan more sharpli than we have now allow for  perhap we have thrown in the towel too soon on our stori of deterior consum confid   moreov  if household spend were to sour appreci  it is hard to see how we would get the upturn we are project in capit outlay next year  a final downsid risk to the project concern our fiscal polici assumpt   asid from the earlier note modif to the  e of the tax rebat  we have not chang our packag for this forecast   but it is clear that the probabl of gridlock has risen signific over the past month  moreov  the possibl that a packag will be enact that is larger than the one we have assum also appear to have gone down   the risk to this portion of our forecast would appear to be skew to the downsid  with respect to our inflat project  we have made anoth small downward adjust to our forecast for core pce price   the indirect effect of lower project energi price  continu favor news on inflat expect  and a small upward revis to structur product led us to mark down our forecast of core pce inflat by     percentag point in both      and        we now expect core price to deceler from about a       percent pace this year to a bit abov   percent in       dave howard will now continu our

when i look at the detail of the forecast  clear the  e of the consum recoveri is an import piec of this stori   and i think your forecast has a signific increas in the save rate in the first quarter of next year and a continu negat on consum durabl  which i assum is a good part automobil   now  one of the thing that struck me is that the natur of labor contract in the auto industri essenti has turn a lot of labor cost into fix cost   i don   t quit understand the past behavior of the industri  but one of the reason whi i suppos they were so will to introduc all these incent was that they were stuck with those labor cost anyway  so whi not get someth rather than noth   presum that motiv would continu in the first quarter and thereaft  so if the under demand is on the soft side we might see anoth round of incent of some sort     that argument make sens   and if so  how much weight would you put on it in term of the shape of the durabl part of the forecast
that argument certain make sens   it is actual an issu that we have struggl with and in some sens we revis up our forecast a bit in the face of both the respons to the strength in auto sale and what we can see happen with motor vehicl product go forward   in our view  howev  that would not impli that there won   t be ani adjust on the product side   we think that may mute the product adjust  and in our forecast we have product fall in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter befor level out in the second quarter of next year   in part we have follow what we are hear from the automak themselv  which is that they are go to be extend down  dure the christma holiday period  and that some of these product cut are actual go to occur   but  when push come to shove earli next year  it   s unclear whether or not they will decid to extend the incent for an even greater period of  e   i think it is certain a possibl and it   s an upsid risk to the project both of auto sale and auto product that we   ve built into this forecast
at our board meet last week at the new york fed we had a consider discuss about the possibl effect on the economi of addit terrorist activ   my own view is that the big surpris of      was that we thought it couldn   t happen here and that if there is more terrorist activ  the american peopl will respond quit strong   do i gather correct that your forecast essenti say either that there will be no terrorist activ or that if there is it will not have a signific effect on demand
i think that is exact what is implicit in this forecast   as i believ we note at the  e of the octob meet  we just didn   t know how to cope with such an event in the forecast other than to make the assumpt that it won   t occur or that if it    it won   t have a big effect   but that clear loom out there as an enorm uncertainti   we just didn   t see ani way in which we could sensibl provid ani valu ad by tri to build in such an event into the forecast
thank you      as alway  i can   t quarrel with the baselin forecast becaus i don   t have an altern that is more convinc or in which i have more confid   and i alway find the altern simul and assumpt that you provid to be use   but this  e more than usual i have a problem reconcil the polici assumpt in the baselin forecast with the forecast itself   it   s not that i   m convinc that the forecast is wrong   but if it is correct  i have troubl understand the polici assumpt   or if the polici assumpt turn out to be correct  i don   t see it as consist with this forecast   mayb you   ve answer my question in your forward look futur base scenario in the  book   but let me at least tri with you a mental exercis that i would have want to run   and that is  imagin that we get to octob of next year and that you have nail the forecast exact   nomin gdp acceler in the second quarter as you have it  in the third             quarter it goe to   percent and real gdp is up to       percent as you have forecast   and suppos all of the associ inform that would have been releas on a week and month basi goe along with that kind of forecast   in that environ  i think the    year rate and the    year rate would have march somewhat higher as that scenario unfold   certain the   year rate would have march higher and i expect that   month and   month yield would be consider abov where they are today   then i tri to imagin your produc a forecast that say yes  all that has happen and the   percent fed fund rate is still correct   i can   t get that to squar becaus to me a ceil on the fund rate of   percent would produc an explos increas in the monetari base  assum that all the rest of the data come out exact as in the baselin
where i might differ with your presumpt of how these develop could unfold is with respect to long term interest rate   we think a coupl of thing are go on there   one is that we would expect  if the committe were not rais interest rate as much as the market current expect  or as the market began to realiz that the outcom was not go to be as strong as they current anticip  that there would be some subsid in long term interest rate  the way in which we thought about our polici assumpt was that  through       we saw an economi that was still run with a consider degre of slack in resourc util and one in which inflat was still head lower   therefor  the imper to rais rate would not be so clear that we were go to build it into our forecast by the second half of        as you know  we do have rate on an uptrend in      as the economi gather even more strength and as the unemploy rate begin to turn down   even then  the environ is still one in which we would expect to see some deceler in overal measur of inflat
but your answer suggest that the consensus privat sector forecast is for even stronger growth than in your baselin forecast of       percent real gdp in the third quarter and   percent nomin   that   s not what i saw in the last blue chip forecast
yes  inde   but i don   t think the blue chip forecast or our forecast is consist with what is current built into fed fund futur   in some sens the experi that we tri to construct in the  book was to ask how much of an upward revis would the market have had to make in their outlook   now  that wasn   t design to tell you what the market    forecast is  i don   t realli know for sure what it is   but my guess is that it would have to be stronger than the one we   re show to justifi the market    expect of a more aggress tighten action by the fed as earli as they see it   so that would say that the consensus privat forecast is probabl closer to the  book than what appear to be embed in financi market now
i had a question on the s ulus packag   you identifi rather clear what the short term benefit are  and you obvious place a lot of emphasi on that   i was just wonder if you   ve given ani thought to the longer term impact of this packag beyond the forecast horizon  particular as it would affect multifactor product and capit deepen   are there ani longer term cost involv that we should be think about
i don   t think there are veri signific longer term cost in the packag we have design   we have design a packag that we thought was sensibl  and we still do think it   s quit sensibl from an econom perspect   whether it make ani sens polit is a differ matter   it was design to provid s ulus for the economi over the next two year without impos long term budgetari cost   most of the item that we have built in  the temporari invest incent  which has a big effect  and the one  e set of tax rebat  obvious would go away   so             we don   t realli see those as necessarili have longer term budgetari consequ   now  one could certain imagin that someth might be label a short term s ulus for the economi that realli would impos longer term budgetari cost   obvious  ani kind of perman chang in either spend or tax would feed forward and would produc bigger effect on long term interest rate  more crowd out of privat invest  and therefor less capit deepen go forward   but that   s not what   s in our forecast
but i think the question was more relat to what i assum is the effect of move up a tranch of capit invest and get an earlier technolog
and presum that   s subop  from a market point of view  but the question basic is whether the effect is big enough to make a differ
the subop  part i   d say would be of a second order   certain in the longer run  becaus that packag goe away  the cost of capit is not affect   you   d still have the same capit output ratio over the longer haul and the same level of product at some point
the capit output ratio is the same but the composit of the capit may not be op  or as effect as
certain to the extent that temporari tax polici is use to provid the s ulus  privat decis are distort in the short run  and we would have a subop  capit stock   but i think that would be a pretti small effect
have you actual done ani analysi on this      is there anyth written  ani paper or studi  on it
well  sinc the propos of some kind of temporari tax incent was put forward  we   ve been work hard to develop the analyt apparatus   obvious we have a             coupl of problem in do that   one is that there just aren   t enough observ in the data to justifi think that we   re go to be abl to es  this veri precis   so what we did was to use sever differ analyt model  parameter to replic some of the key featur of the economi  and then we tri to examin how sensit the outcom that we get are to the assumpt that we have made   what we put in the forecast i   d say would be consist basic with both    putti putti    type of model of invest and the    putti clay    model of invest   but there can be big differ  depend upon the cost of capit adjust   this relat to some of the issu that we talk about in the product present at your meet last june  some of those paramet can make an import differ in the size of this effect   we don   t have ani research paper on this current avail but it   s someth that we will have to continu to work on
let me explor a coupl of relat issu   dino talk about the differ explan various market particip are give regard the jump in the yield curv   a coupl of peopl that i   ve talk to in the boston area realli have been affect  in term of the way they look at the market  by the level of volatil   they view the uncertainti quotient relat to some of the yield as signific  particular on the bond side where they see a market that is not as deep becaus of corpor suppli condit   on the equiti side  the question of how to interpret what the equiti market are say is a veri interest one  given the drop in inflat expect and the rise in equiti price and in yield on the bond side   i   m wonder whether  if instead of extrem op   we   re see as well a degre of real uncertainti   there   s perhap a desir to climb on and not be left behind but also  if one combin the volatil and the lack of depth of market  some under uncertainti about where thing are go   those market move may not be as clear a messag of strength as one might be inclin to interpret them   i wonder how one factor that into one   s think              a relat issu  i think  involv what you said in answer to presid jordan   s question when you talk about excess capac and your forecast of the unemploy rate and a declin rate of inflat even into        the declin rate of inflat is at odd with most of the other major forecast and may be at odd with the way the market see it as well   could you comment on both of those point
with respect to the financi market    assumpt  to the extent that some of the factor that dino cite have been at work  one wouldn   t necessarili expect those to persist over the next two year
and in some sens we have not level adjust our forecast for all of the recent upward movement in long term interest rate on the assumpt that some of that will fade away over the cours of the first half of the year  as the situat becom clear   so that volatil goe down  on the stock market portion of it  i don   t want to pretend for a moment that our baselin assumpt was ani better than the other two that we put into the  book as altern   we certain have had five year of experi with forecast either flat or declin stock market onli to be consist surpris to the upsid   could that happen again   could that be the process that we   re start to see  or are equiti market particip just look beyond the near term   mayb they are just better abl to look through this near term disappoint in profit that we see occur and are will to anticip a stronger rebound in both activ and earn down the road   i think that   s a real possibl   i also think  given how low the equiti premium have gotten  that there is still downsid risk in that portion of our forecast              with respect to inflat  we see the environ on the price side as one in which core measur are more like to be go down than up   we   re alreadi see what we think is the front edg of some deceler in compens   we think both structur and actual product are like to improv somewhat over the forecast period   we made a small nod in the direct of some of the good news that we   ve receiv on inflat expect   and the energi market also suggest that the indirect cost pressur come from energi are like to subsid some   so when we put that togeth  despit the fact that there is some reacceler of activ  it look to us as if there will still be littl upward pressur  and more like downward pressur  on inflat go forward
just an observ  presid     it is certain true that if you look at impli volatil on bond contract  either the    year or the long term treasuri secur  they are veri much elev   they are in a rang we haven   t seen sinc       in some way it   s similar to the observ volatil that dino show in his present   but the impli volatil have come off in the stock market  so it isn   t obvious
yes  it was the bond market volatil
it isn   t obvious that the equiti market are more uncertain now than they were for most of this year   and in the  book financi project   didn   t respond complet to the run up in long term yield over this intermeet period in the same way he didn   t respond complet to the remark and inexplic declin in the previous intermeet period that was associ with chang in treasuri debt manag   so if i were to add to your and dino   s list of market specif event that have affect the amplitud of the swing in yield  i think i would also have to includ the discontinu of the    year bond
so some of the run up we   ve gotten in this period reflect some rollback of what we saw last year
how far are we from insert some mortgag back secur durat variabl in our macro model
far enough that i don   t care to comment    laughter   i don   t see ani immedi prospect
i   m wonder becaus this convers is lead us in a veri peculiar direct   what concern me about it is that we are see this veri high sensit to long term mortgag rate  for exampl in the extract of home equiti that tend to lead prompt to consumpt expenditur   i wonder whether or not we   re go to find that the converg of those two line on the stock of debt chart  treasuri and mortgag back secur  may have some macroeconom signific   i hate to find us do macro simul and then oral comment on whi it  sn   t work in these term   at some point you   re go to want to put a variabl in there hope to captur this
all the macro simul you will care about will be at the shortest a quarter frequenc  and probabl you   ll realli onli want to think about it in term of year by year effect   a lot of these market mechan  includ the chang in the durat of mortgag back secur  affect the amplitud of interest rate in a relat short period   but i   m not will to say that the level of the long end of the yield curv is notic higher becaus of these mechan relat to a year ago
i know you   re not becaus it   s not in the forecast    laughter
well  we   d still think those longer term rate would be strong link to save and invest flow in the economi   that would be import   i will anxious await             dino   s further research on this correl between the option adjust durat and the    year treasuri   i wouldn   t want to ignor an import piec of forecast inform here
that research project got shift to new york   laughter
i   d like to ask two short question   the first one is to dave   and perhap don kohn   in the  book and also the monday morn brief there was a report about the michigan survey of one year ahead inflat expect  indic that it drop to     percent in septemb  to   percent in octob  to     percent in novemb  and then bounc back to     percent in decemb   it seem to me that there   s some potenti veri interest inform there  after all  we   re veri much interest in what is happen to the real feder fund rate   i just wonder how those data  admit volatil but still consider below what we have been look at in the recent past  are influenc your view about the real interest rate as far as the fed fund rate is concern
well  certain  the point we were tri to make in our brief was that we also find this veri interest   we pretti much wrote those data off when they drop those first two month  think that it was complet outsid histor experi   we were inclin to think it was a fluke   the longer the declin persist the more we felt that we need to at least consid the possibl that it was give us some inform about a drop in inflat expect
so  you don   t think polici is as easi as you previous thought
well  mayb don will want to comment as well   but i certain don   t think that there has been a       percentag point rise in real short term interest rate as perceiv by anyon involv in spend decis at this point   howev  the survey result might be  on the             margin  a read that you would want to take on board in assess the stanc of polici  just a piec of an inflat forecast that should not be complet ignor from the perspect of the current set of polici
i certain agre with what dave said   and the fact that long term inflat expect haven   t chang veri much would lead one to discount this survey result a bit   the question would be whether the impli rise in real short term rate is exert upward pressur on intermedi  and long term rate   but i think we can explain  more or less as presid   and dino have tri to do  whi those long term rate have risen through just the general op  plus the volatil   i don   t think  as yet anyhow  that a rise in real short term rate is put upward pressur on real long term rate   but if inflat expect were to continu to edg lower  that would be someth you would need to take account of in assess the stanc of polici
i   d also like to ask dave howard a quick question   the revis to the forecast for japan is pretti stun  particular real growth be revis down     percent in       in addit  there   s deflat in everi quarter through        one has to begin to wonder about the impact of this in the financi sector   my question is   what is your current view about the probabl of a crisi in the financi sector in japan in light of this possibl forecast outcom for the next two year
i think it   s safe to say that it is a major risk   we have the japanes economi come back a bit toward the end of the period  main becaus world econom growth pick up   the japanes do not yet appear to be fulli readi to take the kind of measur that need to be taken to remedi their problem   we see the problem sort of simmer there for the indefinit futur i   m afraid  and certain through the forecast period
just one follow up question   i wasn   t veri clear befor on the issu of the drop in inflat expect   with inflat be a measur of resourc capac use  whether or not we have excess capac  is it possibl that the declin inflat expect are tell us someth about peopl   s expect about unemploy rate and pressur on capac in the futur that is signific differ from what the stock market is tell us about the op  for real growth
it could be  except that in the same survey from which those inflat expect are drawn the unemploy expect haven   t realli deterior as much
they haven   t drop at all
they have deterior some but nowher near as much as one might have imagin if the outlook for inflat were the primari motiv   it could just be that peopl are think that      will be an excel year in term of low consum price   obvious  peopl could be hear about zero percent financ for auto  great deal on airfar  and lot of discount in the store   i think it   s perhap more a reflect of that than of some enorm shift in their view about the economi go forward  which have been relat firm
the longer term inflat expect embed in the yield curv dip right after the septemb attack  hit a low point at the end of octob  and have come back up again  but on balanc they haven   t chang appreci sinc last summer   so they   re not show the same
the same bounc as the shorter term expect
on that same point  dave  in the michigan survey the   to    year inflat outlook didn   t budg   and the survey that our peopl do togeth with the folk at ohio state univers show the same thing   that survey indic a veri near term drop in inflat  which correl with peopl   s experi at the gas pump and with rebat and so forth  and zero chang in the longer term expect   measur of inflat expect beyond a year or two don   t seem to have move at all
further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid parri
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the twelfth district have been weak  but there were a few sign of improv recent   it   s now clear that the terrorist attack sever damag econom condit in tourist depend area   in octob  travel relat employ fell about   percent in hawaii and nevada   signific loss were evid in most other state as well and on net the district   s transport and servic sector contract substanti   as a result of the shrinkag in these sector and other  new claim for unemploy insur surg and unemploy rate increas notic in most area   sinc mid octob the surg in such claim has reced somewhat but the level of claim remain elev  suggest that unemploy rate in these area probabl rose in novemb as well   the san francisco bay area has seen rapid job destruct all year  especi among high tech compani   unemploy there has increas by around        peopl per month sinc the first of the year and that pace doubl in octob  accord  the share of job loser in california   s unemploy pool has risen   and if unemploy durat last as long as usual  we   re like to see addit increas in the unemploy rate in the futur              on the posit side  hous market remain healthi   a primari except is the san francisco bay area where home price have start to declin a bit   but in most other area  demand for new and exist home has been solid and the pace of residenti construct remain high  moreov  industri output and sale figur show some indic of a turnaround in high tech manufactur   at this point  howev  a rebound in demand for high tech equip that is strong enough to get the industri back on a solid growth track   not appear immin   and with boe commit to cut about        job nationwid between decemb   th and januari   th  most of them on the west coast  the outlook for the district   s manufactur sector more general remain weak in the near term  also troubl are the district   s state and local fiscal posit  which have deterior further sinc we last met   most state have cut or have propos cut agenc budget by up to    percent and sever have frozen hire as well   this will put a damper on econom activ  especi in california  where growth in state and local govern job has been a key factor support continu expans in southern california and the central valley this year  let me turn to the nation pictur   the weak in novemb employ put a bit of a damper on the general more posit tone of recent econom data   still  there are more posit sign that i believ are worth note   car and truck sale have been outstand in octob and novemb   of cours  that reflect a temporari surg in respons to zero interest rate financ deal  still  i believ it is encourag from the standpoint of consum    confid in the futur that so mani peopl are will to undertak such commit   the recent increas in the admit volatil new order seri also is encourag  especi sinc the surg was led by order for comput and semiconductor  sector that had led the recess   and final  even though third quarter product growth was revis down recent  i believ the       percent increas is robust             consid the declin in real output in that quarter   relat strong product growth over the past year reinforc the view that the economi is cycl around a trend growth rate that continu to be signific higher than the one that prevail befor the mid     s  overal  recent data seem broad consist with our forecast as well as the  book   s that the recess is like to be relat mild   and financi market develop sinc our novemb meet reflect greater confid in that view   the steepen trajectori for feder fund and eurodollar futur rate is notabl in this regard  our forecast show a drop in real gdp of       percent in the current quarter   we   re assum anoth    basi point cut in the fund rate at this meet and we anticip a rather gradual pickup in growth in respons to monetari and fiscal action in combin with the end of the inventori and invest cycl   the recoveri in      in our forecast is less pronounc than that in the  book in part becaus we are a bit skeptic about how quick firm would take advantag of the propos partial expens rule for invest   of cours  such legisl has to pass  our inflat forecast is littl revis  with slack in labor and product market hold the increas in the core pce price index to just over       percent in        while the recess appear like to be fair mild at the present  e  that outcom is quit vulner to the possibl of negat shock   it   s not difficult to come up with a list of candid   confid is fragil and could be advers affect by expect increas in unemploy  a negat turn in the war  or more terrorist activ   a larg declin in equiti or real estat valu could deepen the recess   and given the deadlock in congress  it   s not clear how much addit fiscal spend or fiscal s ulus will be forthcom   thus  even though it seem like that econom growth will rebound next year without ani further polici action  a case could be made for an addit eas of polici as a bit more insur   thank you

sustain   in fact  one of the big three firm indic that sale weaken consider in late novemb and earli decemb  the experi in the light vehicl industri clear illustr that consum are veri price conscious  and as a result mani retail are offer sizabl price discount   sale so far in the holiday shop season  howev  have been disappoint for most retail we   ve talk with  and as i note last  e their sale expect were fair low to begin with   but as retail keep remind us  sale are often concentr toward the end of the holiday shop season  so we realli won   t know until then how good or how bad sale actual were  report on labor market condit general indic further slacken   research by our staff confirm that a pickup in demand for temporari help tend to preced recoveri in the labor market   we have two veri larg temporari help suppli firm headquart in our district   they differ on their assess of whether there was ani bottom in the demand for manufactur worker   one thought mayb there was  the other said definit not  turn to the nation outlook  the economi is clear in recess and the novemb employ report indic that activ has not bottom out yet   the breadth of job loss extend             beyond manufactur   the  book forecast has an econom rebound take hold by the second quarter of next year   our analysi and most consensus forecast point toward a qualit similar rebound   an import featur of the data so far is that the deterior in labor market appear not to have spill over into an unravel of consum sen ent and household spend   price discount  low interest rate  and low energi price are clear posit forc offset the weak employ situat  howev  i see three major risk that potenti could weigh on activ for some  e  first  despit the favor experi to date  i think the uncertainti associ with the      attack and incom loss from the weaken labor market could result in a sustain period of hunker down by household   this could dampen growth in consumpt and residenti invest by more than assum in the consensus outlook   second  i think we may have a good deal further to go in unwind the capit overhang that becam evid follow the burst of the high tech bubbl  and third  the widespread natur of the slow in economi throughout the world make me concern that global activ will be weaker than we   re anticip   so on balanc  i see the risk for growth in the unit state as continu to weigh substanti on the downsid
it appear that the economi in the dalla district has final join the nation recess   growth has been slow sinc the fall of       but employ continu to rise until this past septemb   the widespread layoff in the travel and entertain industri  combin with reduct in high tech employ and a slow in the energi sector recent  have brought about the first employ declin in the eleventh district sinc        mexico   s recess and the increas difficulti of cross the border are make matter wors  as retail spend along the border has declin signific from a year ago              two other sourc of strength in the texa economi in recent year have been construct activ and export demand   both have turn into sourc of weak recent and are expect to remain so   construct activ has been declin sinc earli this year and report of over capac in some offic and expens home market suggest that construct invest will continu to slow   when oil and gas price are low  as they are now  expans of petrochem facil usual offset some of the local slowdown   howev  that is not happen this  e around becaus of extrem over capac in the chemic busi  export in a wide rang of product categori and to all part of the world have been declin for more than a year and our contact expect littl chang in these trend   defens relat spend seem to be one of the few area of strength   semiconductor demand may have reach a bottom  but our contact concur with the  book analysi that it will be a long bottom and that the demand from the telecommun sector like will not pick up until the second half of      at the earliest   this is a signific negat for the telecom corridor just north of dalla  i concur with the broad outlin of the  book forecast  though i   m a touch more op ist that gdp growth will resum in the first quarter   but i agre that on a fourth quarter over fourth quarter basi growth in      will probabl be around   percent   i think it   s notabl that the  book suggest that most of the weak in current quarter gdp will be account for by inventori reduct and that final sale are hold up surpris well  on the inflat front  i concur with the respond to the univers of michigan survey who seem to have bought into our rhetor a few year ago that we were onli one recess away from price stabil   we now seem to be get the disinfl we wish for  but in my opinion we   re still a long way from deflat              on the polici side  i see the economi stabil or at least not get wors   if econom condit do deterior  i   m confid that we will get plenti of fiscal s ulus   in fact  it   s possibl that we   ll get plenti of fiscal s ulus whether the economi need it or not   with about two third of our monetari polici s ulus still in the pipelin and lower energi price like to be with us for month to come  it would appear that there is no shortag of polici s ulus at this stage of the game  and with the world economi continu to show sign of weak  i   m not particular concern about a potenti outbreak of inflat in       overal  i see the balanc of risk we face as have shift signific and to such an extent that i think we should paus in our polici eas   i believ the balanc of risk is still tilt toward weak  but not so much that the eas in the pipelin shouldn   t be suffici to deal with it  perhap the best christma present we could give the financi market at this stage would be a messag in our statement that the fed see some sign of stabil and is take a wait and see postur befor act again   when i first came into my job and inherit harvey rosenblum as the bank   s director of research i ask him if he had ani rule of thumb concern monetari polici  he said     yes  when in doubt  don   t eas      and i think that   s about where we are now   in my view  ani addit benefit of further eas now is like to be more than offset by the disadvantag down the road of have to revers that eas earlier than otherwis   thank you
mr  chairman  econom activ in the tenth district is like to be lower again in this quarter   the manufactur sector remain in a slump and labor market are soft  howev  the consum sector show sign of have turn a corner   in our opinion  hous  consum spend  and auto sale are point up   we interpret these data as suggest that econom activ in the tenth district may be at or near it bottom              more specif  the bank   s novemb manufactur survey found that product was lower than a year ago  capit spend continu to declin  and firm were not yet done pare inventori   on the posit side  though  the weak is less than it was last month   the year over year declin in product was not quit as great as in octob and was signific less than in juli when the manufactur slump appear to be at it steepest   in fact  some of the anecdot report that we   ve receiv recent from a number of our director suggest that they are see a pickup in order and actual are talk about hire addit worker  have said that  the labor market have eas and are continu to eas in the district   in our latest labor market survey  onli a quarter of the firm report ani difficulti hire or retain worker  and that   s the lowest percentag in our survey   s histori   howev  while unemploy rose in octob  initi unemploy claim fell in novemb and layoff announc in novemb were the lowest we   ve seen this year  consum spend in the region has held up better than mani peopl expect   mall traffic was healthi immedi after thanksgiv  and sale dure the first    day of the holiday season were up modest over a year ago in most place   and the anecdot data we   ve gotten have point predomin toward fair strong consum sale   residenti construct and home sale rebound from the drop off after the terrorist attack   as in the case of retail sale  the lower end of the market is do notic better than the higher end   home sale in denver were not as far below year ago level in novemb as they were in septemb or octob  despit mount job loss in that citi   on the negat side  howev  realtor throughout the district say sale of high end home remain veri soft  energi activ has fallen sinc our last meet   condit in that sector have been a bit divers in the district  with oklahoma show a fair notic declin in activ becaus of their             higher cost of extract gas from their resourc and wyom actual see a continu high level of activ becaus of their lower cost   price pressur in the district are in fact veri minim as we see it  turn to the nation economi  mr  chairman  my view have onli strengthen sinc the last meet   i still believ it is help to split the outlook into two  e frame  the veri near term and the intermedi term or second half of next year   within these two  e frame  i think growth will declin in the current quarter  turn around probabl late in the first or in the second quarter of next year  and be more robust in the second half  which is veri similar to the  book outlook   for this quarter and the first quarter of next year the economi  as i said  will remain weak   but my point is that there   s not much we can do about that today   as for the intermedi term  growth in the second half of next year appear like to be relat strong without requir further action on our part  like the  book  i expect growth in the second half to be close to   percent   the factor generat this growth have been note elsewher and i   ll just highlight them  monetari polici  in my view  is accommod and is contribut to strengthen demand   fiscal polici right now is s ul and could becom more so in the futur   energi cost are declin  and the contribut from the chang in inventori should begin to be posit in the first or second quarter of next year   certain  there are risk to consum and busi confid that we have to be mind of  and the weak in foreign econom growth is also worthi of note  with our current polici stanc  which is accommod  the consensus forecast  both insid and outsid the feder reserv  seem to be for stronger growth in the second half of next year   final  it seem to me that we should not take action now on the basi of event or shock that we cannot anticip or even assign probabl to today   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   while overal busi condit in the southeast remain weak  we   re begin to get hint of at least some margin improv in the consum and relat sector   retail in our area indic that thanksgiv holiday sale met or exceed their lower expect   this is larg consist with the most recent data on same  store sale nation   merchant inventori are report to be lean and retail are guard op ist about the prospect for the holiday season   home construct and sale  while off their peak  remain at high level  driven by lower mortgag rate  in contrast  while record auto sale occur in octob as a result of manufactur    incent program  one of our director who own a divers set of dealership in the atlanta area report the worst month ever in novemb   and our contact at ford indic that their sale in the southeast were the weakest in the countri last month   addit  weak continu in the commerci real estat sector  with commerci vacanc increas in everi major market   at the same  e  manufactur has continu it    month contract and tourism show littl sign of recoveri  speak of tourism  while we know that septemb   th had signific advers effect  particular on the desir to travel and stay in hotel  the import question is how persist will that shock be   recent develop shed light on both the persist issu as well as on how the rippl effect are play out   specif  they suggest that the shock to busi travel has been signific shorter live than the shock to leisur travel   our contact at delta airlin report that overal air traffic has return even more slowli than the pessimist outlook the industri gave the feder govern in the first week follow the disast   delta tell us that while traffic slowli continu to come back  it is current    percent below the pre attack busi plan and revenu is still    percent below that plan   the recoveri in busi travel is also reflect in major busi             center like miami  where cvb hotel have seen a pickup in busi traffic   in contrast  occup rate on miami   s south beach and other local frequent main by tourist remain desper low  as the key european leisur traffic has essenti dri up   as a consequ  disney has postpon indefinit open the first       room of an almost       room resort in orlando   aaa indic that request for theme park ticket in the southeast are    percent of last year   s sale  but their data indic that most of the travel to these facil is by car  not by air   attempt at price discount have not work to induc leisur travel to return to the sky   they remain    fear sensit      in contrast  the evid is that busi travel is clear more fare sensit  airlin have recogn this and are discount busi fare in order to sustain momentum in that area  reflect the reduc air traffic  car rental in florida for the past week are down some    to    percent from a year ago   anc rental corp  which own alamo and nation and reli primarili on air traffic for patron  has file for chapter    protect  and a senior industri contact suggest that not be far behind   in an effort to cut cost  car rental firm in florida are reduc their fleet and have dump an es         vehicl onto the use car market in the past    day  interest  hertz is not among these compani   it   s a subsidiari of ford and has been prevent from respond to market pressur in the same way as the independ firm   two florida cruis line have also file for chapter    protect  and two other have merg  the fallout from these travel relat develop is also be felt in the servic employ statist   the sixth district was home to some of the strongest growth in servic employ in the nation dure the     s   in particular  almost    percent of florida   s   million plus workforc are employ in the provis of nonfinanci  nonretail servic  the state has about    percent more peopl employ in hotel and relat activ than the nation averag   as a result              the slowdown in tourism has hit servic relat job hard and will continu to do so for some  e in the futur  we have continu to press our region contact for insight into when we might expect to see some recoveri in invest spend   while excess capac in most industri certain will discourag spend to add capac  there are now some sign of renew spend on technolog  our contact at the corpor headquart of up in atlanta tell us that while they have cut spend on truck and plane  they are plan a   to   percent increas in technolog spend next year becaus of it central and grow import to their busi   likewis  a contact from cingular wireless  a major telecommun firm serv our region  tell us that they plan to go ahead with substanti invest in a new generat of technolog next year in hope of get a jump on the competit  on the nation front  i believ the extraordinari uncertainti affect the nation outlook  which concern us all at the last meet  may be resolv itself at least somewhat   while i   m not in ani way suggest that the economi has turn around  it would appear that the run of high frequenc data releas in the last week or so has been more posit and could be suggest of a respons to the s ulus alreadi present in the economi   as note in the  book  person spend is up relat to expect and the manufactur sector has begun to show some sign of life   and sever major tech firm  includ intel and amd  have revis upward their sale expect  so perhap that sector may be on the verg of bottom out   the new technolog spend plan of a coupl of the larg region compani i just cite a minut ago are consist with that view  as dave   note  a major differ in the outlook from our last meet is the prospect for addit fiscal s ulus  which now look more problemat than it did a month ago              that is reflect in one of the altern  book simul   this would caus me more concern except for the fact that we have a direct s ulus from the signific drop in energi cost  which has ad to incom and has lower cost    we es  this has ad as much as       percent to dispos person incom in the second half of this year  and our es  do not take into account the extra bonus of a warm winter so far  as we move to our polici discuss  i would join presid   in urg patienc  in light of indic of an emerg recoveri   the prospect of a recoveri is also support by the improv situat in equiti market   i am not convinc that a further move at this  e will alter the near term path of the economi by speed up the recoveri   final  i   m not enamor with the argument that we need to move now as a precaut against further shock  as yet unreal  in short  i don   t think we need to do someth just to do someth or simpli to ratifi market expect   i think it   s probabl  e to give greater weight to longer term consider  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the new england economi slow further sinc our last meet and remain larg in sync with nation trend   that is  the nation is now offici in a recess and so by extens is new england   payrol employ for the region declin in octob and job level in everi state are below their earlier high  though for the region as a whole employ still remain slight abov it year ago level   the region unemploy rate continu to be below that of the nation but the region rate has jump up at a fa  pace recent  look forward  a signific increas in initi claim for unemploy insur suggest that the unemploy rate will rise even further   in addit  help want advertis deterior mark in octob  with print ad fall about    percent on a year over year basi   onlin job list have             not fallen as much and their rate of declin has abat a bit   that may signal some bottom out in the market for high tech worker  but overal prospect for the job situat in new england seem weak  our beig book contact report in novemb that the region   s commerci real estat market deterior in the last few month  with the boston area affect most signific   after almost a decad of mark below averag vacanc as compar with the nation as a whole  boston   s rate have converg to nation averag over a period of onli four quarter and in the process have tripl   rental rate  not surpris  have come down as well  especi in the suburban market   contact say that commerci market outsid the boston area have been less tight dure the previous few year and as a result have felt the slowdown in recent month to a lesser degre  manufactur continu to be weak  with employ declin by   percent in octob on a year over year basi   in particular  the valu of manufactur export has fallen signific and at a much fa  pace than in the nation as a whole   so  the situat in the region is look much gloomier than onli a few short month ago  in the earli to mid summer  one strike indic of this is the downturn of massachusett state revenu   through the end of fiscal      in may  revenu were grow at a pace of   percent  below plan but solid  begin in june  revenu stop grow and in fact drop by   percent  that drop has continu through today   that is a sharp and sudden swing  which i think reflect the broader experi in the region  a mild slowdown in the spring and then a sudden negat jolt as the summer began   obvious septemb   th did not help but it now seem that the slowdown was well at hand befor that tragic day              one key question after such a drop in activ is   when will thing get better   we held sever meet in the last few week aim at gaug answer to that question   we met with local busi peopl to talk about busi prospect  particular with regard to technolog spend   in addit  we review sever measur of region sen ent  consum  manufactur  and high tech busi confid  along with a set of econom indic for massachusett alon   final  along with our beig book call we also contact a seri of temporari help agenc in the region  taken togeth  the data and anecdot suggest that new england consum  manufactur  and high tech sector execut do not expect an improv in econom condit befor the second half of next year  nor do the lead indic forecast a turnaround   mani contact in temporari staf firm indic that busi may improv late in the second quarter or possibl earli in the third quarter   manufactur and retail see the upturn further out in the second half  but contact in softwar and it firm are much more uncertain  and the predict they give when push are general concentr in late      or earli        some tech execut say the technolog recess will be longer and deeper than that of the rest of the economi and report that more shakeout is still to come among technolog firm  final  to end the region discuss on a bit more upbeat note  our new england advisori council met last friday and that group of small busi peopl clear see this period as not onli a  e of uncertainti and challeng but also a  e of opportun   most member of the group report that one or more product line remain strong and comment on this be a period when attent to custom and or innov product or servic would pay off in term of increas market share   a member of the group from a technolog consult compani report a veri recent major posit chang in u s  book   base on his person contact  he believ this spate of new busi was share by the major consult firm like mckinsey and bain as well              busi remain poor outsid the unit state  howev   he attribut these increas book to the stock market upturn  which he regard as a lead indic for the consult busi   sever member note an increas abil to hire skill worker  which had enabl them to be more innov and sourc new product and servic in hous   the two problem face by all were the increas cost of insur  not just for health care but for properti and unemploy insur as well  and a lack of bank financ except on a fulli secur basi   in sum  these small busi in new england seem at this point to be weather the recess well and prepar to be stronger competitor when the economi turn up  turn to the nation scene  certain the equiti market seem to think the  e is near when econom activ will turn up   but i wonder whether that seem confid is a bit prematur   my read of the incom data  particular as they relat to employ  is that the upturn may be further out than the market expect   and my confid in the strength of the upturn in      project by both the  book and our own staff forecast is less than     percent  after a first quarter paus in spend  the consum continu to be the mainstay of the forecast  with the dramat surg in motor vehicl sale in octob and novemb evid of their resili and confid   even outsid of auto  real durabl good spend rose over   percent in octob   howev  real incom fell sharpli and the onli recent elev save rate collaps  consum borrow may not be grow at the same pace as it had been  but debt servic as a share of dispos person incom is rise to level that are histor quit high  at least relat to the last    year or so   combin fall incom  rise debt burden  and the potenti for rise unemploy as seen in initi claim data and layoff announc  and it may be a recip for the sharp consum retrench we have yet to see in this recess   in fact  our bank   s forecast see             unemploy rise about     percentag point higher in      than   the  book  which combin with fall inflat suggest a potenti for consider excess capac  the inventori swing from      q  to      embodi in this  book project realli is quit signific  particular given how littl data we have on inventori as yet   that swing  along with fiscal s ulus  drive a relat robust upturn in        we see a similar though smaller version of this mechan at work   but there are certain risk that the inventori deplet and rebound will be much milder and  as i note  there are risk with respect to consum spend   corpor profit are dismal and the high p e ratio in the s p     reflect both rise ps and rapid drop es   i think the veri euphoria of the stock market right now is a risk in and of itself and not so much an indic of op    if the market were to adjust to more normal p e ratio with a drop in price  that could well feed back to even slower busi spend and declin in consum wealth and confid  final  both the  book and our own forecast contain a rather sizabl amount of fiscal s ulus   as each day pass without some consensus in congress  both the  e and the amount of such s ulus come into question   the altern  book scenario suggest that a lack of fiscal s ulus could negat affect      growth and unemploy rate in a signific way  moreov  whether or not the feder govern act  state and local govern spend like would need to be contractionari in earli      to bring state budget into balanc  at our last meet i argu that while the econom pictur was clear negat and the risk remain on the downsid  i thought the more cautious forward look polici would be to move rate downward in small step   i recogn the logic in aggress address econom weak in the absenc of inflat  but i believ we have done that   i continu to believ that the resili of our economi and the health of our bank system  just to name two factor  make it less like that             we will face a deflationari spiral   i also think it   s general not wise to move polici in fear of potenti disrupt that have not yet occur  in that regard  there are glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel   durabl good order and semiconductor chip sale may be signal a turnaround in busi spend   but i think they   re onli glimmer as yet  no matter how they are receiv by the equiti market   risk remain weight toward weak beyond that incorpor in our forecast  and inflat is quiescent if not declin  given the uncertainti on the fiscal side  there may well be room for a bit more polici eas  though i do have some measur of agreement with sever of my reserv bank presid colleagu about how close a call this is   i still favor the cautious approach  but take out a bit more insur right now against the downsid risk strike me as a reason and measur step   thank you
i don   t have a whole lot to say about our district economi that is new  overal activ seem to have continu to declin in novemb   in particular  retail activ in our region fell sharpli in novemb  base on inform we receiv in the month survey we conduct  much of the declin seem to be the result of a drop off in car sale   moreov  most of the retail that we talk to are not op ist about the holiday season   there   s a lot of discount go on at all level and in all categori of store   onli the big box discount like wal mart and target seem to be have fair good result so far  in the manufactur sector also the news that we   re receiv is not favor   shipment  new order  and order backlog all declin further in novemb overal   mani manufactur compani are either reduc their capit budget further or freez them   a few manufactur among those we talk with regular did report some pickup in busi and a few indic that they   re             reconsid some of their earlier decis to cut capit spend   but those firm are definit in the minor  on the nation economi  clear there may be more reason for op  regard the outlook today than there was at our novemb meet   other have made a number of comment about that alreadi   the stock market is up  treasuri bond rate are up  credit spread have narrow  and the feder fund futur market suggest that market particip expect polici to be tighten more aggress next year than was expect earlier   there is some evid  though i would say it is limit  in the recent econom report that the contract in activ may be moder   and at least some indic  the michigan survey  for exampl  suggest that consum confid may be stabil   also  the small increas in nondefens capit good order in octob could be an indic that the rate of declin in busi spend on equip may be slow a bit   but in my view the downsid risk in the outlook are still materi   so let me play scroog and underlin them  cathi   and other have alreadi made some of these point  first  i would suggest that the op  so evid in financi market may reflect to some extent the assumpt on the part of a lot of investor and other that this recess is go to end in the spring becaus the averag postwar recess has last about    month   but this assumpt may well be unwarr if this recess is differ from the go stop kind of cycl we have experienc in recent decad   the op  may also reflect confid that fiscal s ulus will be forthcom and that when it come it will be effect   but in my view  and other have said this too  it   s not clear that fiscal s ulus will be forthcom   and even if it is  it   s not clear to me that it necessarili will be effect  beyond that  the latest hard econom data we have are not as a whole rosi in my view  the  book report that  despit indic of somewhat more favor news with respect to             equip invest  the staff is now forecast a veri signific further drop in spend on equip and softwar in the current quarter   and while peopl have recogn the weak in labor market  i wonder whether we may be minim just how weak that novemb job report was  after all  the level of payrol employ was about         job lower than had been anticip befor the report was releas   and the rise in the unemploy rate over the last three month has been the fastest increas in a long  e  sinc       i believ   moreov  the drop in manufactur job  at          was the biggest declin so far in this cycl and  of cours  that number has been come down now for a long  e   with weak labor market  of cours  the risk is that the contract could be deeper and longer if household confid is shaken   confid may be advers affect by job loss that have alreadi been report  if peopl are concern about lose their job or about the prospect for slower growth in wage and incom  one other statist that i think underlin the downsid risk is the sharp deceler in one year ahead inflat expect as measur by the median respons in the latest michigan survey  as bob parri mention  that number drop from     percent in septemb to     percent in novemb   the decemb survey show a rebound  but the level is still much lower than in past month  look further back into the past   some of this declin may be transitori  relat to what is happen to fuel price and so forth   but i think there are broader reason to be concern about disinfl   the  book es  that core pce is current run at a rate of about       percent and the staff is forecast that it   s go to come down     point to   percent by       moreov  focus again on labor market  it seem to me quit plausibl that the unemploy rate could peak at a higher level than is now be project in the  book   if that happen  i think that would have an impact on wage and also implic for disinfl go forward   fortun  to this point our reduct in the nomin fund rate have prevent the disinfl that appar             alreadi has occur from push up the real fund rate   but i continu to believ  given all the inform we have  that we need to do what we can to keep real short rate from rise in the near term futur

thank you  mr  chairman   i   m not sure i have a lot to add at this point  so let me be brief   i   ve report for a long  e now that the district economi has been track the nation economi rather close   as a general that still is the case  but let me make a few comment about thing that are a littl differ or new  clear  labor market condit in the district have eas  that is not new  but the unemploy rate has actual risen veri littl to this point   and i would have to say  as best i can judg from anecdot report  that holiday hire was better than i had anticip earlier   the major retail i   ve spoken with seem satisfi so far with holiday sale  relat to their subdu expect let me add   nevertheless  they are not complain inordin about what they are see   the pattern in sale that has been evid for quit some  e  with discount do better than full servic depart store and specialti apparel peopl somewher in the middl  seem to be continu  base on same store sale data and discuss with these retail   the larg retail also indic that they have made no adjust to their capit spend plan for the next year or so  histori tell them that if they cut back  they will find that they   ve done it just as the economi start to improv and will wish they had proceed with the addit store   so  on those ground  they haven   t chang their capit spend plan  in convers with some peopl from sever larg financi servic firm  we hear that their busi with consum remain veri activ both in term of demand for credit and sale of financi instrument  though demand from the busi side are slow   and final  while             commerci construct activ is slow in the district  hous activ as measur either by construct or sale continu to be reason robust   it certain has held up longer and better than i would have expect by this stage  as far as the nation economi is concern  i   m more confid than i have been for some  e that someth like the  book forecast will materi   the basic stori as i see it is that the strength in consum spend is restrain the weak this quarter   there will be some payback for that next quarter but then a more sustain improv will get under way   the latest data indic to me that  if noth els  the economi is clear in a process of stabil   it is not fall off a cliff   and as i said  i find the  book stori reason convinc  although i would certain not be astonish if it took anoth quarter or so for the recoveri to get under way   i think  e is alway a matter of consider uncertainti  as i   ve comment befor  hous activ is a measur we might consid in think about the mindset of the consum   after all  the purchas of a hous is a long term commit  when peopl are will to buy a new home  that involv a     or    year commit  even allow for sale and refinanc and so forth   and the hous activ number continu to suggest to me that consum confid remain reason healthi  i would also note that whenev econom activ start to pick up  it   s like to take us some  e to recogn that upturn unless all seri turn posit at onc   my experi is that that rare  if ever  happen   so even if the economi start to improv in the second quarter my guess is we won   t recogn that with much confid until the third or the fourth quarter   i would think  by the way  that the unemploy rate is go to continu to go up for some  e   that seem to me to be almost bake in the cake  final  i will restrain myself and not discuss polici prefer at the moment
thank you  mr  chairman   under econom condit in the third district have remain essenti flat sinc our meet five week ago  suggest that the economi has onc again stabil   this is an improv relat to the condit i report here at the novemb meet  when the district   s econom situat was worsen   we know that consum spend will be an import impetus to the recoveri   holiday sale in the district have not been as weak as mani had fear  although it   s still too earli to make predict for the season as a whole   region data do not yet show a broad base pickup in retail sale  and some of our retail contact are express concern that sale may remain weak into the spring   and consum confid in our region continu to declin through novemb  the hous market has not fare as well in the region as it has in the nation   while hous permit and the valu of residenti construct contract were up in the spring and summer  they   ve remain flat sinc then   the falloff in residenti real estat market is expect to be a modest one  howev   busi invest is not like to contribut to growth in our region  at least until the second quarter of next year   invest in structur by busi declin this year and nonresidenti build contract in our three state drop dramat over the last few month  vacanc rate in the citi of philadelphia and it suburb are up about   percent sinc the begin of the year   the market is not as overbuilt as it was in the     s  so the real estat cycl will not be as deep as in the previous recess   of cours  this also mean that real estat will not be the engin of growth for the recoveri  equip spend by respond to our south jersey survey  which includ retail  servic firm  and manufactur  was down in the third quarter and is expect to grow onli modest over the next six month   in novemb  manufactur in our busi outlook survey report that             they expect no rise in capit expenditur  includ structur and equip  over the next six month   manufactur in our district remain quit weak   the indic of general activ  new order  shipment  and manufactur employ in our survey have not recov from the steep declin report right after septemb   th   survey result suggest that there is some inventori correct still to come in our manufactur firm  with about     of the firm report in novemb that they plan further cut in inventori   when ask when they thought the recoveri would occur  over    percent of the respond to our survey  includ manufactur  retail  and servic firm  expect to see some improv befor or dure the second quarter of next year   but the servic firm and retail were somewhat more op ist than the manufactur   this is consist with the philadelphia staff   s forecast  which suggest some modest pickup in employ in all three of our state by the second quarter of next year accompani  howev  by continu increas in unemploy rate in our region  it is also consist with mani forecast for the nation as a whole   for exampl  the median forecast from our fourth quarter survey of profession forecast also predict econom recoveri in the second quarter of next year  as   the  book   my own view for both the region and the nation is a bit less op ist   i think it will take some more  e befor busi and consum feel the recoveri is in place  perhap by midyear or the third quarter  although i must admit that the error band around these forecast make it difficult to distinguish among them  consum spend is the key element in all the forecast   obvious the pattern of growth will be affect by auto sale  which were pull forward by the zero percent financ deal and  therefor  will fall back next quarter   nonetheless  in most forecast consumpt is the engin of growth next year beyond the first quarter   as growth of consum spend acceler  inventori build resum  follow by a pickup in invest spend  which help solidifi the recoveri              philadelphia staff analysi of the behavior of lead indic dure previous recess suggest that we are on path for such a recoveri   howev  i remain somewhat concern that the econom recoveri could be delay  even given the sizabl monetari s ulus appli this year  which no doubt has help to attenu the downturn  in particular  two part of the recoveri scenario appear problemat   first  the strength of the recoveri is depend on further fiscal s ulus  the detail of which remain to be work out  second  weak labor market condit could undermin consum confid and spend   should this happen  the  e of the recoveri would be later and the magnitud smaller   that said  as i discuss last  e  i believ the committe should begin focus on the medium  and longer term  recogn that the full effect of it action  those implement throughout the year as well as ani action taken today  are felt with a lag   we need to prepar the market and the public for the  e when further rate cut are not need  and i think a more measur approach today to polici is appropri   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman    first  i   m surpris by al broaddus   s negat  tone on the labor report becaus i realli expect him to come in here and note that west virginia  which is more in his district than in mine  had it lowest unemploy rate in the histori of the data seri
i start to do that but in light of the reaction to what i said about west virginia last night  i thought that might not be wise    laughter
and about nine other state regist drop in their unemploy rate  our region enjoy spring like weather last week  set a record high of over    degre on one day  so even the shutdown of ltv steel product did littl to revers the gradual build op               the rang of opinion of peopl we talk with ran from those who are expect notic improv in their busi in the first half to those who mere believ that the economi has stop contract but are not confid that a pickup will occur in the near term   even the hard hit heavi truck manufactur believ that we are at or have alreadi pass the absolut low  although most think that it will be late next year at best and more like in      befor there is a notic increas in truck product   my guess is that the strong rebound in auto sale plus the continu firm in residenti real estat market in our area have help restor confid more than just a littl   an accumul of small stori  such as a gm stamp plant announc last week that it had open for     peopl and a data servic compani in kentucki say that it plan to hire sever hundr peopl in the come year  has mitig somewhat the long expect loss of steel worker job in the region   one steel compani execut went so far as to say that she hope the bad prospect last long enough to get the consolid that we need in the steel industri   a larg region bank announc that they are reinstitut hire bonus in an effort to fill the continu larg number of open that they have   health care organ are now the largest employ in mani of the metropolitan area in the region and they continu to report hard to fill open and consider wage pressur  construct spend continu to be strong except for the build of hotel and restaur  which has stop complet   we were told by a union offici  this probabl reflect what jack guynn was say about his area  too  though i don   t know what share of hotel restaur  hospit worker are union in his region  that nation the union expect to lose half it member   a director in the construct industri report that sinc septemb     over    billion of commerci construct has been either cancel or suspend becaus the lender cannot get insur or it cost is prohibit              on retail  as gari  n was suggest  we   re all accustom to retail express disappoint with holiday sale   they   ve been do it for    year at least   but now what we   re actual hear is that they are pleasant surpris   in some case such as kohl   s  one of our director is on their board  they actual have had veri strong sale   for other compani like feder  sale haven   t fallen as much as their worst fear and  therefor  they express some satisfact with how the holiday shop season has play out so far  we survey all of our current and former small busi advisori council member last week and the tone of their remark was similar to what cathi   said about her group   they are weather the downturn better than they had expect  so their report were not strong negat in tone  on the fiscal pictur  i have a littl differ perspect than what i   ve been hear so far this morn   name  i think the stalem between the execut and legisl branch is a veri posit long term develop in that it has gone a long way toward disabus the public of ani residu notion they had that there was such a thing as a discretionari countercycl fiscal polici   laughter  one of the interest develop in this recess  especi sinc septemb   th  has been the differ as compar with      in both the behavior and the perspect of household and busi   if you recal  at this point in      with desert shield lead up to desert storm  both household and busi seem to go into a hunker down  worst case  mini max mode  an    avoid the worst outcom    type of approach   household simpli have not done that this  e  wherea busi seem to be act veri much as they did in        everybodi in busi is from missouri   they   re not go to believ in anyth good until they see it in their order book or sale  well  from this start point one of two thing can happen   either household will belat turn             pessimist and becom more conserv or busi will final shake off their pessim and conservat about the outlook   either scenario has major implic for the set of financi market condit that will be associ with whatev econom develop actual occur  gdp in the current quarter  which onli has    day to go  will be a negat number  if the  book is right  and it   s go to be negat becaus of a veri larg declin in inventori   that   s not necessarili a bad thing  either for our own economi or for our trade partner around the world  so mayb we ought to be hope for a negat fourth quarter if inventori liquid is what it is go to reflect  i can   t forecast interest rate even as well as most peopl can  but i   m fair confid that we   re go to have a flatter yield curv a year from now   especi if the  book forecast is right  i see the yield curv flatten most from the short end   it   s a question of how we get from here to there   i   ve been puzzl about all these report that we are expect to cut the fund rate at this meet by     or     point   most peopl survey  and i don   t who these peopl are  say we   re go to cut the fund rate   one of my director is on a govern affair council for the american banker associ and they had a meet veri recent  i think at the begin of last week   over     banker attend and  after listen to an econom brief  they were ask to indic whether they thought the fed should lower the fund rate at it meet today   he said no one rais a hand among the     or more peopl there   and when ask if they thought the fed had alreadi cut rate too much  he said almost everyon rais his or her hand   so i ask my communiti bank advisori council that first question last friday at our regular meet   one banker did say that she thought we ought to cut the fund rate by     point today simpli becaus it was alreadi built into expect  i guess she read the newspap  and everybodi els said no              i still think about the level of the fed fund rate differ from the way i think about an action to cut the feder fund rate   if i look at the level  i don   t see a need for addit insur   i believ we are provid an adequ amount of liquid at the current level of the fund rate   an action to chang the fund rate is news that will be broadcast on cnbc and cnn and it   s go to get a headlin   the issu is   what is the messag we   re send and to whom are we send it   if we want to send the messag to main street  then perhap we ought to cut the fund rate      of a percentag point   it  sn   t matter how much we cut it  we get the headlin regardless   but i think there may be some merit  as a few peopl have suggest  in disappoint the wall street expect of a cut   by do so we may signal a more posit tone  indic that we are comfort that the outlook is improv   thank you  mr  chairman
okay   let   s break for coffe  which i presum is outsid   coffe break
presid  pool
i will tri to fill in a few interstic of the discuss without repeat what is alreadi befor us   my wal mart contact said a coupl of thing that i thought were veri interest  he said that when wal mart compar price of item be sold this holiday season that were also sold last holiday season  the price of these ident item are    percent lower this year   i think the retail environ can onli be describ as brutal competit   my contact also said that there is a lot of evid that consum are veri cautious   it look as if peopl may be wait even more than usual to purchas item in the holiday shop period this year   they may be plan to pile up purchas at the end of the season or may just be wait for lower price   there is a higher percentag of layaway purchas than usual   that   s not a retail strategi that mani of us around this tabl use but some part of the popul do   there is also a continu prefer shift among             consum away from premium product toward so call valu product  the lower price item in a line of merchandis   inventori at wal mart are in veri good shape  right on track with where the compani want them to be   my contact said that for the first  e he   s find that the soften in the labor market has made it easier for wal mart to hire sale associ   you may rememb at earlier meet that i said wal mart continu to find a lot of tight in the labor market for that level of skill  my fedex contact said that absolut noth had chang in their situat sinc we talk six week ago  except perhap that head are not hang anymor   it look as if thing are just settl down   his firm   s forecast for next year show a flat first calendar quarter over the first quarter of this year and they   re anticip some improv in the second quarter and beyond  i note that jack is tri to horn in on my up monopoli here    laughter
i won   t do it again  i promis
that   s okay   i   m from chicago and i believ in competit market   laughter  includ for inform   the overal tone at up seem to be a littl more bullish than at fedex   my contact said busi has been fair good and up is anticip that volum in the begin of next year will be up by     percent  that is their busi plan  compar to the first part of        this year   s volum is come in about flat compar with last year  my contact at j b  hunt  a truck compani  say that busi is particular slow   his firm see no basi for op  about the first quarter of next year  let me make a coupl of comment on the nation economi   there has been a lot of discuss about fiscal polici and i think it   s worth reflect on the fact that the  book realli can   t make ani assumpt other than that temporari is temporari and perman is perman   but i think a better way to view fiscal polici right now is that fiscal polici is in play and is like to be in             play for some  e to come   when we think back to the earli     s  a s ulus bill  i think it was call an invest credit at the  e  was under consider at the begin of the clinton administr but was not enact   then there was a tax program that was enact narrowli   after that  fiscal polici was settl for quit a long  e   it began to be discuss again dure the elect campaign last year   now fiscal polici is in play  and i think we   re go to see continu discuss about adjust   fiscal polici is not go to be a sourc of stabil in our outlook   we cannot expect that everyth will be resolv  howev this s ulus bill come out   that   s not go to be the end of it  i think  it seem to me that we are in the neighborhood of a cycl trough   i don   t know exact what that mean  but i   d say it mean the trough will occur within the next few month   that   s consist  of cours  with the  book forecast  one other comment i   d make is that i think it   s clear that household behavior is not character by expect of ongo deflat   peopl are respond to sale incent as a reason to buy rather than to project that better deal will be avail in the futur   therefor  the sale incent are lead to addit sale now rather than the postpon of purchas with the expect of get an even better deal by wait anoth few month   so  that   s my take on the current outlook
thank you  mr  chairman   for some month now the econom statist have been veri negat   all year the  book has been respond to these statist by revis down it forecast  as have the blue chip and other forecast   but we now find ourselv in a more ambigu situat   some indic still look weak but other are turn up   we may be approach an import crossroad for monetari polici             the list of indic that are begin to show sign of strength  or at least stabil  is long   in the last month the napm durabl good order  person spend  and construct spend have all turn up   consumpt of semiconductor has risen as have comput shipment  nonfuel commod price have increas late  perhap indic futur strength in demand   and oil price have drop  which paradox could be an expansionari forc   bond and stock market are both indic that credit market think better  e are ahead   but welcom as these sign are  one should not get carri away   fan alway feel good when their team   s lose streak has end but this   not make their team a strong team    laughter   as the recent employ report indic  the economi is still soft and it will take a long run of good news befor we can declar the recess or the soft period over  perhap becaus of the immin sign of strength  it now seem less like that congress will pass an econom s ulus packag   my own most like  book forecast has becom the one label    no fiscal packag      an import boost in the baselin  book forecast is given by fiscal polici assumpt  specif the acceler of depreci loss   if i assum that the fiscal packag  sn   t pass  i can sidestep this debat between jerri jordan and the  book forecast on the exact impact of that packag   the forecast in that no fiscal packag scenario show anoth year of sub trend econom growth  with growth not return to trend until some  in      and with the unemploy rate peak at     percent  which is a long way from full employ by anybodi   s definit   moreov  it   s almost too gruesom to mention  but the economi is still vulner to negat shock  whether from further terror or just plain negat econom shock  for whatev reason  short term anticip of inflat by those respond to the michigan survey have taken a sharp drop   when combin with the high unemploy  the low oil price  the incipi drop in measur inflat  and the fact that product is hold up             remark well for a recess  there are solid ground for project lower inflat as the  book has done   inde  there are solid ground for project lower inflat than the  book has forecast   given all this  the still weak economi  the still vulner economi  and possibl reduct in inflat  i think one can make a veri strong case for a further eas of monetari polici more or less in line with what the bluebook has call    a perfect foresight polici     that   s a self congratulatori label  though one that suit my present purpos    laughter   but in contrast to my feel for most of this year  the case for further eas is not quit as compel today  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the second district   s economi has shown clear sign of rebound from the depress level note in my report to you at the last meet  and there are further sign of downward price pressur   consum spend in the district seem to have rebound in novemb but remain below pre attack level   retail across new york state report that sale were up   to   percent from a year earlier over the thanksgiv weekend but were flat in the follow week   in both week  sale were said to be particular sluggish in new york citi  construct and real estat activ have been mix   manhattan   s offic market soften further in octob despit the loss of the trade center   manhattan   s apart sale and rental market also have soften sinc the attack   howev  singl famili home sale throughout new york state rebound in octob with price remain well ahead of year earlier level   both singl famili and multifamili hous permit in octob were littl chang from pre attack level  the stori about manhattan   s commerci real estat market is realli quit interest becaus everybodi was quit convinc until the   th of septemb event that the commerci real             estat market was quit tight   about   percent of the offic space was wipe out by the attack on the twin tower  but sudden we don   t have ani shortag of avail offic space   so it becam clear that some of the appar tight in commerci space reflect hoard  a real estat version of the over invest that seem to have been take place  and not just in the tech sector  there has been good news for the futur of lower manhattan     whitehead  who for four year was chairman of the board of director of the feder reserv bank of new york  has been name by the governor to be chairman of the lower manhattan develop corpor   i think that will bring some necessari decis to what is go to happen in the citi  which is a veri import factor in restor both consum and busi confid  nation  base on the assumpt that monetari polici will be eas and that the fund rate then would be held steadi through a good portion if not all of next year  we have forecast econom growth of   percent q  to q  in      and of     percent in        we see the core pce deflat at     percent next year and     percent in        the unemploy rate in our project is quit benign   it reach     percent by about the middl of next year and then gradual come down to about     percent in        we do assum in this forecast that about      billion of fiscal s ulus will be pass by the congress and that it will be reason effect   should that not happen  our econom forecast would be somewhat weaker although obvious  depend on the natur of the fiscal s ulus packag  how much effect it will have next year is veri question  the mood of busi leader in the district is extraordinarili glum   it   s reach the point where it seem to be becom fashion in new york busi circl to show that one can be at a greater depth of despair than one   s neighbor   in fact  i   ve given up tri to discuss ration forecast with busi leader and now have shift to ask this question   when you figur out that you   re wrong  can you revis your busi plan and do it quick   the answer to that is yes  which i think is             far more pertin than whether these busi leader have the right forecast   but the degre to which the spread of gloom can be self fulfil i think is a downsid risk to the forecast  we are assum that growth abroad will continu to be anem and that  therefor  the current account deficit  what i view as the long run weak point of the american economi  will continu at about       percent of gdp   we think that can be financ and probabl financ with veri littl if ani weaken of the dollar   but it is someth that concern me great over the longer run as an indic that the world economi simpli isn   t balanc well   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the convers thus far has indic that it is extraordinarili difficult to identifi with great certainti turn point in the econom cycl   a number of peopl have alreadi point to some of the posit that emerg in the intermeet period  includ retail sale  new order of durabl good  auto sale  et cetera   i would onli add to that by say that even our appropri cautious financi and forecast gurus here at the fed have look at those data and produc a  book that for the first  e in sever round   not featur a downward revis to the outlook   howev  as other have note  the fed fund futur market and market particip in survey are near uniform in their expect of anoth eas move at this meet   so whi is that   i think the answer is becaus the turnaround implicit in the posit data and even in the forecast is still quit tentat   and some of the posit we have seen may reflect in larg part a one month bounceback from the shock of septemb   th and may not necessarili prove to be a certain precursor to a sustain turnaround   i see the risk in the turnaround scenario to be quit clear and almost all to the downsid  labor market condit are continu to deterior  which might have a negat effect on consumpt by household and delay the expect turnaround   second  i believ almost all             forecast assum some form of fiscal s ulus and  as we   ve alreadi discuss  the state of fiscal s ulus is veri much in play and quit uncertain   third  there is risk from the intern environ where we have a synchron global downturn   i think the turnaround intern depend much more on whether or not our economi recov as oppos to our look to other to be the engin for recoveri   final  financi market could easili deterior if the expect of a return to growth and profit are not met   and if such a negat event to financi market were to occur  that clear would be a drag on consum and busi plan  not a support for them  a number of issu have emerg with respect to polici   i  like presid  n  will restrain myself on that subject but not as much as he did    laughter   first  some peopl have suggest that we shouldn   t move in expect of a terrorist attack and i would think that is certain true   we cannot inocul the u s  economi from potenti or actual polit threat   on the other hand  we can posit polici in such a way that we can make the economi as robust as possibl  even in it relat weaken state   second  i   ve heard at least one or two peopl refer to the risk that if we move today and then revers our stanc later  that might be surpris to the market   i find that a littl hard to understand becaus the market have alreadi built in an expect of a turnaround in polici   so were we to move today and then turn  we would simpli be valid what the market expect  governor   stole my thunder with respect to the perfect foresight polici   i know i don   t have it  but presum a goal of have a committe is that we approxim someth like perfect foresight with the consensus build that goe on here   so i would encourag all of us  befor we get to the polici discuss  to look at page    and    of the bluebook if you haven   t done so  and final  harvey rosenblum   s name was mention as a superb economist   i will not tri to bring the view of anoth economist to the tabl  but i would bring samuel  son to the tabl              samuel  son demonstr his wit on hear that an acquaint was plan to remarri by describ that as a triumph of hope over experi   when we get to our polici discuss  i would certain expect that this committe  with perfect foresight  would not let hope triumph over it wisdom and experi    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   recent at fomc meet  one of the key issu that has weigh on the polici decis is whether or not the forecast is stabil   in fact  as governor   just note  in each of the previous fomc meet this year there has been some meaning downward revis in the  book forecast   and these revis have been follow by further eas   so it seem that a precondit for an end to the cycl of eas is a stabil in the committe   s forecast   this  book deliv such a stabil   inde  it has a small upward revis in project growth for next year   my forecast has the same properti and a number of you around the tabl have reach the same conclus   this at least put on the tabl the possibl of hold the line on the fund rate  if not today then perhap after today  of cours  we face a tension between the forecast and the incom data on product and employ   the incom data reflect the project declin in output this quarter  and over the next sever month we   re like to see further increas in the unemploy rate until econom growth come back to trend   in my view  prudent monetari polici would call for an end to the polici eas cycl befor an end to the rise in the unemploy rate   nevertheless  the sharp of the increas in the unemploy rate in novemb and the uncertain effect of that on sen ent and spend at least put back on the tabl the possibl of a littl further eas at this meet  one way of think about monetari polici is in term of the path of the fund rate   a second way that i some  find use is in term of the desir path of real gdp growth  as if that             were the instrument under control   given the lag in the respons of monetari polici and the prefer with regard to move interest rate  when i play this game i don   t adjust gdp growth for a coupl of quarter   the question i ask as i look at the  book is whether the strength of the rebound as we get to the middl of next year is about right or  for exampl  would be better scale up  i view that as a way of gaug whether or not there is room for further eas   that room depend on three consider   the rate of employ in mid       when growth move abov trend in the  book forecast  the inflat rate at that  e relat to the committe   s long run object  and how much project growth is abov trend in the follow year or two   the committe   not have an explicit long run inflat object  so i do the exercis in term of my own long run object for inflat  which is       percent for the pce core inflat rate  it seem to me that these consider reinforc each other and suggest relat to the  book forecast some room for further eas   the unemploy rate peak just abov   percent and is still       percent at the end of       as compar to my es  of the nairu at that point of       percent   and the inflat rate is almost     percentag point below my long run object at the end of the period   a number of peopl  governor   and governor   both  mention the perfect foresight simul  and this is the messag that come through in that particular forecast  on the other hand  just to keep it close  i expect that growth might be stronger by mid      than project in the  book and i   m slight more pessimist than the  book about inflat  first  i expect a sharper cyclic rebound in equiti and therefor i start with the staff   s altern simul with a stronger stock market   the  book equiti path is predic on further earn disappoint and a percept that there is some overvalu today  given the excess op ist earn expect   there   s good logic in this assess  to be sure   but i suspect that this logic will be overwhelm by a more normal cyclic rebound if the economi perform as             project in the  book   down the road  we   ll face the implic of ani result overvalu  second  i believ we may be at an inflect point   we are shift from progress downward to upward revis to the forecast   and this reflect a tendenc toward a coincid of posit error or smaller negat error in spend equat dure recoveri period  with respect to inflat  the  book focus on the effect of declin oil price and the emerg slack in labor market   i would put more weight than the staff   on the implic of what look like a signific advers suppli shock   the staff es  of structur product growth has declin from a bit abov       percent in      and      to about   percent this year and about       percent next year   we  or at least i  place a lot of emphasi on the effect of the product acceler on both demand and inflat to explain the except perform of the economi in the second half of the     s   now  the deceler is differ in charact from the acceler  and perhap this will matter   it reflect a move from overshoot in      and into       relat to some longer run sustain growth rate for product  to undershoot next year   in addit  it reflect some effect from increas spend on secur   but it seem to me that this swing could damp the project disinfl   to be sure  the staff has taken this into account in their forecast but not with the weight i would have given it   as a result  i view the negat suppli shock as at least a risk factor relat to the  book forecast  the bottom line is that there appear to be a littl room for further eas  but we are rapid approach the point where it may be prudent to hold the fund rate stabl for a while   even at this point  the committe will still be abl to adjust the degre of s ulus go forward by it decis on how long to remain at the low prevail fund rate and how gradual to return to neutral
well  given my long tenur of a long weekend and a day to look at this inform  i won   t pretend to be as up to date on mani of the seri as the expert around the tabl  but i want to bring to the tabl some observ i   ve note  which are more from an anecdot perspect of the busi communiti and the bank communiti  first  my main concern regard where we are in this busi cycl is where we are on the busi invest side   the reason is that i believ what got us into the recess was the drastic drop in invest in certain key technolog sector   i feel op ist that inventori correct are well under way in that sector and that we may actual begin to see some stabil in sale  the consum has realli kept the economi go in this cycl   we can see that both in hous and in auto sale  even though i believ a lot of the recent auto sale repres a  e differ due to the attract financ program   but the consum has been use the refinanc of home as a way to increas dispos incom everi month  and we know that the pool of mortgag that can be profit refinanc by consum is dwindl   in fact  i would argu that the recent uptick in refinanc mortgag is what we normal see when long term mortgag rate begin to go up  as the astut refinanc jump in and lock in rate that they believ have hit their low   so  i don   t believ we   re go to see much more of an increas in spendabl incom come from the consum   and obvious  as mani other have said  the threat of terror may put a damper on the consum  as will unemploy worri  the other sector that concern me  and i say this in light of recent person experi  is state and local govern due to the financi stress current be place on them  particular in area that depend a great deal on sale tax revenu and on revenu tie to the employ situat  those entiti are have to spend substanti sum to support respons to potenti terror activ              final  most corpor execut i talk with feel that they have veri littl abil to rais price at this  e   in fact  they   re feel more pressur to cut price  as has alreadi been discuss  to deal with inventori accumul and excess capac   so i find veri littl pressur on inflat at the moment
first  i   d like to associ myself with governor bie   s preambl   i share the same view   i would like to make one observ on the subject of fiscal polici and the s ulus packag  which has been discuss by a number of peopl   i do so from the standpoint of have spent much of the last    year be veri close involv in the public polici format process  congress function best or most ration in two environ  either a crisi or a consensus   that s not becaus member of congress are necessarili weak peopl but becaus the system was design that way   we reelect the entir hous and a third of the senat everi two year  and that is not a circumst that lend itself to creat statesmen or women or to fo  long term think   as we move away from a sens of crisi  we move into an environ where i think the s ulus packag is in some jeopardi   that is not  as presid jordan suggest  becaus it involv a conscious reject of discretionari countercycl fiscal polici but becaus we find member of congress  particular in an elect year  tug by their core constitu   where that leav us now is that to the extent there is a grow sens of confid in the economi  despit that confid be base in part on the assumpt of a fiscal s ulus packag  it will in fact have jeopard the possibl of a s ulus packag be pass   it   s a bit of a catch      so in that veri narrow compon of the outlook  i think the probabl of an econom impetus packag is less than it was    day ago   thank you
we move on to don kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   as mani of you have remark  perhap the most strike  and certain welcom  aspect of this intermeet period has been the mix charact of the incom econom data   for the first  e in mani month  data have not point to further downward revis to current and prospect econom activ   import  although measur of aggreg employ and output show the economi overal continu to contract appreci  key element of privat final demand have firm  and by somewhat more than expect   this latter develop would seem to provid the first concret indic that further contract in the economi could well be limit  and some tentat support for the project turnaround begin earli next year   the key issu for you today would seem to be whether  with the econom outlook perhap stabil  the monetari s ulus alreadi in place is suffici to fo  an adequ rebound  thus argu for keep polici unchang at this meet  or whether the persist soft in activ and price  along with the possibl that you are see a fals dawn and the recoveri may be damp  justifi a further slight eas of polici of    basi point  in practic term  the differenti effect of either stand pat or eas by     point may not be that great   becaus both repres a step down from the recent pace of eas  either will reinforc percept in the market that the fomc believ that the end of the eas cycl is near   with such an expect alreadi larg embed in the term structur of interest rate  long term interest rate should not chang much under either altern   still  the choic will matter to some degre   in addit to it effect on the cost of short term financ  it could have some small influenc on longer term rate expect  especi if you do not eas as market anticip   perhap more import  the infer market particip draw about your own econom outlook and your weigh of risk and cost in polici decis will help them to shape how asset price respond to new inform go forward  a decis to leav rate unchang at this meet would seem to rest main on the combin of a more stabl outlook and the extent of previous polici eas   polici has eas more rapid than in most econom downturn  in part reflect your effort to take account of the implic of new inform not onli for the current situat but also for the path of the economi into the futur   in this regard  you may see the degre of s ulus in the stanc of polici at the end of your last meet as alreadi base on expect of further weaken in the economi and as suffici to fo  a satisfactori recoveri begin next year from the lower level of resourc util in train   inde  to some extent  the aggress of polici eas may have reflect your attempt to protect against downsid risk  as well as to address the central tendenc of the outlook   this seem especi the case at your last meet when sever of you remark that the choic between    and    basi point was a close call   if you thought you had polici posit about right at the end of your previous meet for the forecast and the balanc of risk             you saw at that  e  the inform you have receiv sinc then  which suggest smaller downsid risk and no more contract than expect  could be seen as support a decis to keep polici unchang  in addit  if you believ that the staff has been relat conserv in it interpret of the recent news in it assess of final demand  you may see some greater upsid risk to the staff forecast than perceiv earlier   judg from the rise in bond yield and equiti price  the privat sector has becom consider more op ist about the prospect pickup in the economi  accentu the dispar with most econom forecast that has exist for some  e   the persist of the steep upward slope of the yield curv for so long may mean that op  extend beyond bond trader and financi intermediari to saver and spender   one piec of evid in support of this possibl has been the surpris resili of consum confid in the michigan survey  notabl in expect about the futur   even if the staff has the fundament right  they could be trump by anim spirit for some  e as the economi turn around  bol  equiti price and spend for a while  moreov  as a number of you remark  some of the import downsid risk to the staff forecast may not readili lend themselv to be incorpor as an influenc on the current stanc of polici   stock price misvalu could last a long  e  and in the interim polici that adjust out of concern about the effect of a futur sharp drop in price will have been promot subop  econom outcom   and  in the case of equiti price  eas a littl now to protect against a futur major declin might onli feed the current perceiv disequilibrium   the possibl effect of a second major downsid risk  anoth terrorist attack  would also be equal difficult to build into polici today  given the wide rang of possibl   altogeth  the committe may see the practic polici risk around a central tendenc forecast as much more balanc than at your previous sever meet  support the argument to hold rate unchang at this meet  howev  although the outlook seem to have stabil and the risk around the forecast seem to have becom better balanc  the recent data are preliminari and tentat   and  as yet  they are inconclus as to whether a reason strong and prompt rebound is in process or the economi is like to remain weak for some  e and the recoveri delay and tepid   econom activ continu to contract  and  while the current stanc of polici mean that the committe will need to stop eas well befor growth pick up substanti  you might want some greater assur that a turnaround is in process befor paus   if so  you should consid eas polici slight further at this meet  moreov  the  book forecast  itself  may not point to an entir satisfactori econom outcom   in that forecast  with the feder fund rate at it current level through       growth is not strong enough next year or the year after to cut veri substanti into the excess margin of underutil resourc             that is come to prevail   persist excess product capac and relat modest profit growth hold back the upsw in invest and repress consumpt growth by weigh on equiti price   these forc of restraint erod onli gradual  and to promot recoveri they must be counter by maintain an accommod stanc of polici for some  e   the perfect foresight simul in the bluebook show that  with inflat alreadi low and like to declin further in the staff forecast  polici can be eas even further to promot a more vigor recoveri  without sacrif the committe   s longer run price stabil object   and  as dave point out  the staff forecast is not without it major downsid risk  in addit to those pose by a sharp correct in equiti market and anoth terrorist incid  notabl the potenti influenc of increas in unemploy on consum confid and spend and the possibl that fiscal s ulus could be consider smaller than assum  eas polici today by     point might have littl immedi effect on financi asset price  as it is fulli anticip by the market   but it would encourag and give greater scope for a later downward adjust of long term interest rate and  henc  support for asset price and spend  as investor confront the disappoint realiti embodi in the staff forecast  or someth even weaker  even if you suspect that the staff may be unduli pessimist about demand and activ next year  you might still favor an eas at this meet   such an action could be seen as provid greater protect against the possibl that the economi could remain weak for a while or that the upturn could turn out to be insuffici  without incur much inflationari risk   to be sure  the more you eas  the sooner and by more you may have to tighten  and that revers could need to begin next year  especi if the economi   turn out to be more vigor than in the staff forecast   such a pattern was anoth featur of the    perfect foresight    model  and it is built into market expect   but  if the committe is will to stop eas when a turnaround is seen as more definit  and to tighten preemptiv as strength becom evid  the level of resourc util that seem like to prevail  even under more op ist outlook  should keep downward pressur on inflat for long enough to allow such a polici revers to forestal inflat pressur from emerg  financi market particip seem confid that you will carri it off  judg from the combin of low inflat compens and a sharp turnaround in expect short term interest rate after further eas today that is built into the structur of interest rate   such market confid  itself  provid a safeti margin for the committe  becaus it keep inflat expect damp and rais real longer term interest rate prompt in respons to surpris strong econom news   in effect  a further eas could be seen as take advantag of the credibl grow out of your past action and good inflat outcom to provid a margin of protect against the possibl that  at the current stanc of polici  the economi will turn out to be weaker than is consist with fo  the committe   s object of maximum employ and stabl price              whichev polici you chose at this meet  you might still see the risk to achiev those long term goal as tilt toward econom weak for the forese futur   even if you thought that the economi might be stronger than in the staff forecast  output is like to grow more slowli than the rate of growth of potenti for a while and inflat should be move lower   at some point  the prospect of higher output gap in the short run could be balanc by expect that growth will pick up suffici over a longer period to rais question about inflat pressur at the prevail polici set   but given the veri tentat natur of the indic of futur econom recoveri  that point would not seem to have been reach yet
i have a coupl of question about this    perfect foresight    model   it   s an ideal way to make monetari polici  if we have a perfect foresight or even some foresight    laughter   i   m just curious about it from a technic standpoint   with refer to the model  there   s a sentenc in the bluebook that say      the policymak is assum to view both the output and inflat gap with equal distast  and the penalti on interest rate chang was select to deliv polici predict that make the fund rate about as volatil as it has been over the past ten year      i   m a littl curious as to whi that constraint in the forecast is requir if the model fulli determin what the economi is go to do   it   s a fulli determinist model  but there has to be an op um path for short term interest rate that   not requir that sort of tradeoff   whi is it there
if you didn   t have it there you would have some much sharper declin in interest rate   it   s a tradeoff   by put in that constraint you are deviat from the op um possibl econom perform
i understand that   whi do we want to   if in fact you   re get the sort of result that you find distast  are you not suggest that the model may be at fault  rather than the assumpt
for one thing  if that constraint weren   t there we would be deal with a zero bound situat  given the staff forecast   that   s not a reason not to show it
i think we all know what   s happen here   let me see if i can rephras my question in defens of my posit that the constraint undercut part of the point of this exercis   you have a set of fix coeffici here   in ani econometr model there is a rigid that probabl   not exist in the real world  and there are second order and third order coeffici that tend to stabil instead of produc distinct  exact effect  they smooth everyth out   and that i presum is what you   re do
this experi requir in essenc the specif of the policymak   s prefer function   if you   re tell us that you realli don   t care about fluctuat in interest rate  then this isn   t the op  or perfect foresight polici for you   the reason that in some sens the constraint is in there for this particular exercis is that one could infer from the data and your past behavior some prefer for limit movement in interest rate   and this is a polici that is predic upon not just a constraint on movement in interest rate but also on some notion of what your distast is for output and inflat gap
i think the issu is not about our feel or our tast  this is a question of fact   if you have a perfect foresight model that is wholli determinist  then ani action you take should exact replic what is go to happen in the real world   that   s the presumpt  but if you are put addit constraint into the model  of necess you must be overrid the determinist natur of the model becaus the model solv in the sens that you have as mani unknown as you have basic input   consequ  you   re over determin the model on the basi of judgment that essenti say that you don   t want an op um conclus or  which is more like and is obvious a fact of life  that the model itself is not a true replic of realiti in all respect
there are two aspect to what you said   the first is  yes  the model repres an averag behavior over the histor period that was es    that by itself smooth             the reaction of household and busi to chang in financi market price   it smooth the reaction in financi market price to chang in behavior   put all that smooth behavior into the model would  as your intuit suggest  allow short term interest rate to move a lot in order to stabil the result   but the second aspect is the word    determinist      this realli is a perfect foresight path   it assum that you know the whole futur path of the outlook and you know what the coeffici are precis   if you just had uncertainti about the coeffici in the model  and depend on which coeffici they were  you might attenu  you might not react as strong to that news   so it is possibl to construct an op  path in the presenc of uncertainti about both the model and the shock that  depend on the object function  potenti will have the properti of move the fund rate in the outlook period by less   the shorthand way of captur that without work out the veri hard problem of specifi the uncertainti about the coeffici and the shock in the model is to say  well  find the solut under perfect foresight but put a penalti on movement in interest rate
i don   t want to pursu this at length here  but i do want to determin precis what you   re suggest   it involv a veri complex mathemat solut   you just can   t say that smooth creat this result and that the constraint that you   re impos with respect to the exercis  includ equal tast
it   s equal distast  that is the better term  which is a mathemat term   the problem is that it   s a veri use concept if onli we could appli it   and i   m just tri to ferret that out  which get me to the real question i want to ask   grant that the presumpt with respect to polici are what you stipul  name that in effect there   s equal distast              that there   s an object function endeavor to limit volatil  and there   s a constraint  which is realli part of the model  that the feder fund rate has to be greater than zero   assum all of that  how signific are the effect of altern econom assumpt on the path of the feder fund rate  is this a model in which the input specif for the economi  not the polici they are impos  creat a veri sensit  fluctuat fund rate   or are the polici restraint such and the natur of the long term structur outcom of the economi such that  almost independ of what some of the input variabl are in the economi  the path is essenti robust
the model use for this is the same model use in the altern simul in the  book
i assum that  right
so you do get a sens of how sensit the econom outcom are to differ polici assumpt   for exampl  the fiscal polici assumpt that governor   mention produc a somewhat differ outcom for the economi  and that would feed back through the polici path   and import  becaus this is a perfect foresight model  even if you anticip someth happen or not happen  say  out a year or two  that feed back into your current polici stanc
that   s the reason whi i   m rais it
the committe is assum to choos a whole path for the feder fund rate that minim the squar deviat of the output and inflat gap at everi point in  e  take account of all the inform you have way out into the futur
yes   the reason i   m rais these issu is that i think this is a veri interest  origin addit to the various vehicl that we   re employ in make monetari polici   and despit the presumpt  which is obvious factual true  that all we ever set is the fund rate for the next    minut  there is nonetheless a path that we should have in the back of our             mind   grant all the weak in this type of approach  it is conceptu the way we realli ought to be go about polici issu   it get to the kind of notion presid broaddus was rais in earlier period about the op um inflat rate  where we should be  how we should get there  and what is the path of the fund rate that stabil inflat and therefor presum long term real growth   so i   m mere say that this is a worthwhil endeavor to pursu   it   s just that i   m tri to understand it
just to underscor what don said in term of the robust of altern  it realli depend on the durat of the other altern   some of the type of shock in the  book altern  which are relat temporari  don   t perturb this path all that much   but one can imagin other type of shock  includ differ assumpt about product growth  that could displac the path by much more becaus you are choos an entir path   and here come our part of the presumpt of put this in the bluebook   we had to make an assumpt about the committe   s long term inflat goal   these simul were construct use the assumpt that it was   percent   but if you move that a bit  it will have mark consequ
but the op um long term inflat goal should be determin by the model if you believ the model   there is a level of inflat that maxim long term econom goal   it shouldn   t be an input to the model   presid pool
i have a differ subject to rais
okay  go ahead
a veri quick question   on page   of the bluebook there is a statement to the effect that investor current believ that our decis at this meet will includ a balanc of risk weight toward weak   is that conclus from talk with peopl  from survey  or is it extract from the fed fund futur market  or what
it   s from sever survey that show a univers expect among economist and market observ about the balanc of risk   you can   t infer anyth about the balanc of risk from financi price per se   so it is survey base
one  for instanc  is the money market servic survey   in last friday   s survey  twenti out of twenti respond said the balanc of risk would be tilt toward weak  for the januari meet it was three out of twenti who thought it would go back to the neutral   by the  e you get to their expect for the march meet  it is half toward weak and half toward neutral
don  let me see if i can ask a question on interest rate volatil   i observ that after we move the last  e  futur fund rate actual went up
i think the immedi reaction to our move was that the eurodollar futur rate went down by    to    basi point
and then there was the new inform
new inform that brought it up  okay   but they are now higher  second  assum that we have an easi polici now and also assum that if we have an easi polici  it would be better to have less volatil in interest rate than more volatil  are we not risk  by move the fund rate down  increas the volatil of interest rate
i think if you move down and then up  in some definit sens that increas the volatil of interest rate over the period of  e   but i don   t think it necessarili would increas the volatil of interest rate in the short run becaus move down now is exact what the market expect   in some sens not move would increas the short run volatil of rate becaus you would be do someth unexpect   that   s not necessarili good or bad   you ought to do what you             think is the right thing to do   but i don   t see that an eas today would have a materi effect on the volatil of interest rate other than in the definit sens that at some point next year or the year after you   ll have to rais them again in order to further
rais them more than you otherwis would
more than you otherwis would
further question for don   if not  let me get start  prior to septemb     i think there was clear evid of stabil in some sector of the economi   that pattern was broken decis on septemb      not onli did the quit intens forc that were caus deflat in asset price and econom activ prior to septemb    subsequ gather momentum  but new forc of a similar natur began to press down quit signific on the economi   frank  that was one of the reason whi i was concern that the  book forecast prepar for this meet would be revis downward   i was delight to find out that i was wrong   and i suspect the reason i was wrong is that someth is go on in the economi  even in the world economi  that was not evid earlier  name that we are see a greater synchron of activ within this economi and worldwid   there is far greater synchron  for exampl  among the twelv district  among differ type of compani and product  and clear among the world economi   that has general been read as an indic that the world is becom more vulner to cumul downturn becaus if everi economi is move in the same direct  it becom a self feed  self reinforc process that can induc volatil in the econom system  i suspect that that view has to be temper at least in part   and i think the evid we have seen in the last coupl of month  especi sinc septemb     is that to a larg extent the synchron in world econom activ is due to the avail of veri substanti improv             inform   thirti year ago we use to see compani and industri move in quit differ direct   one of the reason was that the inform avail to individu firm was distinct differ becaus  unlik the situat today  a real  e data system that permit everyon to look at the same databas did not exist   what that mean in today   s environ is that imbal that emerg can be more readili resolv  but the resolut can creat contract or expans in econom activ   if everyon is look at the same data and is subject to somewhat the same imbal  we get synchron  but it is not a synchron that is necessarili self cumul on the downsid  one can veri readili argu that the evid of the last two month is inde a fascin test of whether the latter is the case   if there ever were a situat in which the fabric of confid was go to be breach throughout the busi and consum sector  septemb    would have done that   inde  for a coupl of day the economi came to a veri dramat halt   what we are now observ  howev  is not cumul weaken but the emerg of mix sign in the economi  we   re see some evid of stabil  and the question is basic whether we are look at the emerg of forc that are engend not onli stabil but an actual recoveri from here  the market are obvious say yes   the stock market is difficult to understand  especi in term of what we know about earn  and the bond market is even more difficult to understand   but there are well inform peopl in those market who are tri to maxim their asset posit   so it   s not a roulett game out there  if the veri consider and continu overhang of deflationari forc  which we discuss at consider length at the last meet  is still there  and all of the evid suggest to me at least that it is  then the question is what is go to revers this contract in econom activ   well  one of the element that have been discuss around the tabl is the inventori situat   and inde the             inventori number are simpli awesom   my recollect is that octob motor vehicl inventori went down at an annual rate of      billion on a nation incom and product account basi   we   re see veri signific liquid  which essenti mean that as soon as final demand stabil  day    suppli in an oper sens will go down veri rapid   when that occur  busi firm will sudden start to find themselv short  and order will turn up   well  we are not quit there yet  but we are get a few veri earli signal of some firm of demand   they are occur main in the commod market  which tend to be reflect  especi the metal  of the base of the durabl good economi  the most volatil and inventori laden part of the economi   price are begin to move up in commod market  suggest that demand is begin to pick up there becaus inventori liquid has probabl reach a maximum  that mean that the rate of product will start to rise relat to the rate of consumpt of materi and product  that inventori may now be closer to the point where firm will start to taper off the rate of liquid is evidenc by the respons to the nation associ of purchas manag question on custom inventori posit   sinc by definit all inventori are manufactur good  the peopl who know what   s happen are those who sell such good   so  the purchas manag of manufactur or industri concern are in the best posit to get a sens of the current status of inventori   a full survey of all those who actual hold inventori is a veri difficult undertak  the data collect process is lengthi  and when such a survey has been tri the result have not been satisfactori   this survey  which is relat new  seem to be captur a good part of what is go on in the marketplac  contrari to what outsid es  are suggest with regard to the industri product index for the month of octob  we are begin to see a veri dramat slow in the rate of declin  the reason we are see a smaller negat than the market is that there is a lot more current             product growth  or more exact growth in output per hour  in the manufactur area than outsid observ are assum   that slower rate of declin is also reflect in the veri rough week seri that   s suppos to replic the industri product index  it show that most of the declin in octob occur in the first two week of the month   product start to come back in the last half of octob  but it couldn   t come back enough to prevent the averag for novemb from be below the averag for octob   these figur  if we can believ them  essenti are say that the level at the end of novemb is abov the averag level for novemb or at worst about equal to it   that would suggest that product level are begin to support a reduct in inventori liquid  if this is inde happen  then final demand clear is where the uncertainti are   the crucial sector is person consumpt expenditur where there are a number of forc at play   one is motor vehicl sale  which have been startl high in octob and novemb and in fact have been engend a good part of the liquid in inventori for that part of the economi   howev  as best we can judg  motor vehicl sale slump veri sharpli in the first    day of decemb   they were realli quit weak  and one would assum that they were close to the averag level project in the  book for the month of decemb  but they seem are on the way down   so motor vehicl no longer seem to be a posit forc  anoth posit forc that has been remov stem from the rise in mortgag interest rate  they obvious are up quit signific   inde  the    year treasuri yield  which usual is a good proxi for mortgag rate  has gone up almost a full percentag point   and as best i can gather  that   s pretti much what has happen to mortgag rate   low mortgag rate have been a key factor in the turnov of exist home from which realiz capit gain are engend   and sinc those realiz capit gain are a major part of the extract of home equiti for consumpt purpos  one would assum that higher mortgag rate will fo  some weak in exist home sale and  indirect              some weak in consumpt expenditur   it is certain the case that the cash out in refinanc mention earlier also would be affect  larg becaus the absolut level of refinanc is alreadi declin signific  and there is no evid that the cash out proport have chang enough to offset that   so we are begin to see some soften after a prolong period when the extract of fund from home equiti has fo  consumpt expenditur  on the posit side  obvious  we   ve seen a signific declin in the price of fuel oil and gasolin   the effect can be quit substanti  as a number of you have indic   but rememb that these are one shot effect and that in order for those effect to continu we have to get still further declin in crude oil or natur gas price   that   s not like to happen  but it is certain the case that we are now get the full impact of the declin   what we use to call an oil tax cut probabl exert it effect with veri littl lag   it has been a major factor in the market and it may well be a factor hold up christma sale   but we don   t know that quit yet  the major uncertain negat is the further rise in the unemploy rate   i am not refer primarili to it eventu level becaus if the rate went to a higher level and adjust there  the market would also adjust and we would pretti well know what consumpt expenditur were associ with that level of unemploy   but when the rate of chang is as great as it has been in recent month  and when the rate of layoff is as high as it has been  we are get a whole new set of consum that are shock by uncertainti   the impact on consumpt is indetermin at this stage  the sign is pretti clear   it has to be negat but we don   t know how negat   so at this point we   re not clear as to how to view this weaken employ situat or we shouldn   t be clear becaus i don   t think there is ani way in which we can know  fortun  homebuild per se has been hold up  and while the rise in mortgag rate may trim it some  the weather clear has been posit in the area where the major popul center             are locat   as a consequ  weather is like to give us somewhat better residenti construct activ in the period ahead  and i presum that   s also the case for some area of nonresidenti construct  how the combin of final demand balanc against the issu of inventori liquid probabl come down at the end of the day to capit invest  as a number of you mention   and capit invest get down to corpor cash flow   here i think the uncertainti relat to the ongo deflationari pressur is still veri formid   while we have had much better output per hour than we anticip for this particular period and presum wage increas and general worker compens are deceler  the abil of firm to pass through increas cost is virtual nonexist   this is anoth way of measur the extent of the deflationari forc that are press on the economi   the evid we have  both anecdot and otherwis  is that it is veri difficult to pass on cost increas to custom   profit margin have come down veri sharpli   inde  if we look strict at the nonfinanci  nonenergi corpor sector  profit are down to level that are as low as i rememb them and the inabl to rais price is realli crippl cash flow   what that suggest is that the outlook for profit is veri import to the general outlook and that   s where final demand is go to be financ  it   s certain the case that secur analyst  as i have mention to you previous  are not terribl good as forecast but they are not bad as report   and they are report that the high tech earn outlook has stabil in the last three or four week   the non high tech area  howev  continu to deterior though at a lesser pace than it was   this clear is a pattern of earn expect that is inconsist with what stock price are do if one believ current standard capit asset valuat model   but as dave   point out  it may veri well be that the market are display increas flexibl and that the abil of this economi to recov will differ from what             it was in the past   analyst and stock purchas may be look beyond the current squeez in profit expect to a much better longer term outlook and may perceiv that the increas flexibl of the market may itself enabl lower equiti premium and the obvers higher price earn ratio to persist in the marketplac   but how all that will come out clear relat to the outlook for capit invest   at this stage i would say it is just too earli to make a judgment  when we get to polici  it   s pretti evid to me that the case for stand pat at this point requir that the stock market remain overvalu for a protract period of  e   now  that   s not an inconceiv event   it may be  as dave say  not an overvalu but possibl a new way of look at the market   you didn   t say exact that  dave  i   m just interpret what you said in a somewhat differ manner   or it may be  as often happen  that the market stay overvalu or undervalu for protract period of  e   if that   s the case  it is conceiv that the earn outlook could stabil  perhap even improv  in which case capit invest can stabil and consumpt may still do well on the presumpt that long term mortgag rate do not keep go up and creat addit problem   but it is a credibl posit  i would onli argu that the risk of do noth is too high becaus i think that the play out of deflationari forc  at least look at profit expect  is not anywher near complet   it may have an extend period to go  we don   t know that   but so long as that is the case  i think we would probabl be wise to move the fund rate down anoth    basi point  as the market expect  and retain the statement that suggest that weak is the most like risk in the outlook   i don   t deni that our histori  that is  the feder reserv   s histori  is one in which we   ve typic move at least onc more often than we probabl should have on both end of the cycl   i   m not sure that   s all bad  first of all  we   re not absolut certain that had we not move we would have gotten the outcom that we are look at in retrospect   but we   re alway deal with uncertainti and unknown and we   re             alway tack away from one place or the other   if i knew for certain that the economi was go to be move up in the second half of      as in the  book  i would say it would be a grave mistak at this point to move the rate down   i don   t know that and i don   t think anybodi can know that   as a consequ  i think that the least riski action is to reduc the rate becaus  as i   ve said in the past  one way of look at these type of situat is to ask ourselv what are the consequ if we are wrong   and in this case i would suggest that if we move the rate down    basi point and that turn out to be wrong  i cannot conceiv of the deflationari forc move away suffici quick to prevent us from move the rate back up well befor inflationari pressur rise   if on the other hand we stand pat and these deflationari forc are larger than we expect  we   ll look back and find that stand pat was a mistak   i know it   s a close call and i don   t want to argu that this is a close issu  i do think that the weight of the evid at this stage suggest that the best solut is in fact to move down    basi point and stay asymmetr to the downsid   vice chair
i concur with your recommend  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i support your recommend but i do want to express a littl uneasi about the balanc of risk statement   let me explain   i ask myself the question  what differ   that sentenc make   it   s clear that the downward move of    basi point is built into the market  and in my view long term rate are go to go wherev they go  but this is not go to affect their direct in come week   i think our task at this point is to start an order process toward a chang polici stanc   that is  we seem to be close to a turn point in the economi   and what we would not want is a situat in which the market believ for some reason that we are pretti commit to addit cut in the futur even though the data might start to come in rather convinc in the other direct   so that   s my concern about the balanc of risk   in other             word  the messag that i person would like to send  to put some probabl on it  is that there may be a two third chanc that we will not chang the fund rate at the next meet and a one third chanc  if the data continu to come in weak  that we will reduc rate anoth  e   what i would not like to do is to creat an impress that we believ there   s a high probabl that we will be cut rate again at the next meet   that   s my concern about the balanc of risk statement
i agre with that and i think there are two way to handl that problem   one is in the balanc of risk statement and the other is in the full press statement that we make   i would much prefer to put someth in the full statement itself that recogn that the situat has chang from an unmitig set of negat forc to a more mix environ now   i would prefer to do it that way becaus  as far as i   m concern  it   s too abrupt an adjust to chang to a balanc of risk statement that say it is just as like that at the next meet we will rais rate as lower them   i just don   t think that   s credibl   but it   s certain credibl  in fact i agre with your probabl that the chanc are probabl two to one  that we will not be chang the fund rate at our next meet
mr  chairman  the reduc size of the rate decreas  from    basi point sever  e in success to    basi point  will in and of itself send the kind of signal that i think we   re look for   that   s part of the messag that come from reduc the size of the cut
mr  chairman  it seem fair like to me that econom recoveri would occur next year without ani further eas of monetari polici   howev  that outcom is vulner to a number of negat shock that could hit the economi at ani  e   with inflat well in hand and feder reserv credibl in good shape  i believ we have the flexibl to respond to these             risk   therefor  i strong support your recommend of a    basi point reduct in the fund rate as some insur against downsid risk   i also prefer a balanc of risk statement that emphas econom weak
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend and would like to associ myself with presid parri   s view   the reason i support it is in larg part becaus of the uncertainti about how to interpret the incom data and the outlook   in those circumst  as he suggest  insur is probabl a good thing to have
mr  chairman  let me make a coupl of comment that may make your recommend look a littl more moder and restrain    laughter   there are certain some differ in the situat we face today from the one we were look at when we met last month  but i think there are a lot of similar as well   at the novemb meet i favor a    basi point reduct in the fund rate  which we eventu did  and i favor it veri strong and categor  there were primarili two factor that condit my think   first  i didn   t see ani evid of either inflat or rise inflat expect anywher   and second  given our high credibl  i thought we would have  e to revers cours  if we need to  and move the rate back up   after all  we did that in       so we have had at least one recent experi when we were abl to pull that off  given these two precondit  i thought we ought to use some of our credibl to eas polici aggress and to reduc the risk that disinfl might undercut the s ul impact of the reduct in the nomin fund rate we had engin   i think those two precondit are still in place and in my view the polici risk today are much the same as those we face last month              what i think we need to do abov all is to avoid get into a situat where inflat expect are quit low and we have the nomin fund rate close to zero   that   s the so call zero bound problem   it   s veri difficult to get out of that  as i think we know   we don   t want to go there  as we discuss earlier in the meet  inflat expect in the michigan survey have drop quit abrupt over the last sever month as a whole   so i think that risk of a zero bound problem is still with us   for that reason i believ a persuas case can still be made for anoth    basi point reduct today  use the current core pce rate  which is about       percent  as our measur of inflat   that would take the real fund rate down rough to zero   now  grant  we   ve gotten into difficulti in the longer term past when we have push the real rate below zero  and this was especi evid in the     s   we took the real fund rate to zero in       which is where a    basi point reduct today would put it  and we did not get a subsequ increas in inflat   so i still think the case is persuas and in my view a    basi point cut is the best option   i recogn though that the tone of the econom data is a bit stronger in some respect and in some place this  e  therefor the argument for a half point is a littl less compel today than it was last  e   but if it were my choic  i think that is the way i would go
mr  chairman  i agre with the recommend for a    basi point reduct in the rate   in my view it   s appropri this  e becaus i think it will help to underpin the consum while the inventori cycl complet itself and corpor profit and capit spend slowli return to more normal level   i also believ that the balanc of risk should be toward weaker econom growth   and i strong support the idea of put a signal in the word of the press statement to the effect that the situat is not as bleak as we saw it last  e   i don   t want to encourag peopl to think that we continu to see onli negat news on all front
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i would prefer to leav polici unchang today  let me quick sketch out the element of my reason   part of it i touch on earlier   i do think that the stori in the mainstream  book forecast is a reason convinc one and i   m certain more confid about the outlook than i have been for the past sever meet   is it a done deal   of cours not  but that i think is too high a bar   we   re not go to know that for quit some  e   it   seem to me that the recent spate of data suggest that the economi is stabil   not onli do the data suggest that but a lot of market particip are expect that  base on the way financi asset are be price   and at least in my view our economi has a histori of be resili and larg self correct   beyond that  i think polici has been veri expansionari   i   m not talk just about aggress reduct in interest rate  although we have done that   we have also had veri rapid growth in the monetari aggreg and it would be a shock to me if we got deflat  given the kind of growth we ve had in money for some  e now   i don   t know how fiscal polici will play out  but i would guess that we will get some ad fiscal s ulus   and while it   s certain true that if this further reduct in rate turn out to be a mistak we can revers direct when need  it   s possibl destabil  though i don   t want to overst this  to embark on that kind of polici path   so for that combin of reason  recogn that perhap no one of them is convinc by itself  i would prefer to stay where we are
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend   while i support a statement of unbalanc risk toward weak  i also believ that the committe should avoid encourag an expect of further eas at the next meet   given my recent experi in communic with the market  i   m not give ani advic on how to do so    laughter   i will             view with great interest the statement this  e  as it tantal us with a possibl way of accomplish that goal  i   m veri pleas to see that the committe will continu it practic of use it two day meet as an opportun to have a wider discuss of key issu relat to the strategi of monetari polici   becaus this is my last fomc meet i will not have an opportun to particip in these discuss or even to make suggest for the agenda   so i thought i   d take this opportun to unveil some recommend  in this case for improv the transpar of monetari polici  in the hope that the committe might find it worthwhil to discuss this topic in the futur   let me also note the excel contribut to this topic from the recent confer at the feder reserv bank of philadelphia  transpar mean  in my view  reveal to the public both the object that drive the polici decis and the rational for specif polici decis   i see greater transpar as serv both to enhanc the account of the fed and to increas the effect of monetari polici by improv the market   s abil to anticip futur polici action   in term of transpar about object  i would urg the committe to discuss again and to consid further set an explicit numer valu on it long run price stabil object   i state my case on this recommend in a paper earlier this year  so i   ll focus today on recommend relat to the minut and the role that document play in convey the fomc forecast  the committe   s press statement have becom briefer and more repetiti this year and in my view less reveal   moreov  some committe member have express a prefer for move further in this direct   to be sure  it is a challeng to have more than a veri brief statement and still repres the consensus of the committe   in ani case  as a consequ the minut have becom a more import vehicl for reveal the committe   s view on the outlook and polici             option   the minut serv to illumin the rational of the recent action and in addit they recogn the divers of view on the committe  the first chang i would recommend is either to elimin the discuss of recent indic at the begin of the minut or to move it to an appendix at the end   this discuss is present on page one  i presum  to set the context for the meet  not to describ what we discuss   as it is today  it is the first substanti section in the minut   to my mind at least it numb the reader  laughter  and may even distract those who continu on and remain for the summari of the committe   s discuss that follow  i had thought about recommend that the next section  which is the paragraph that summar the staff forecast  be expand mayb to a full page   in the end  after some quit interest and construct discuss with the staff  i decid not to recommend this cours of action out of concern that move in this direct might interfer with the freedom the staff current perceiv in put togeth it forecast   at the margin though  it still might be use to expand the paragraph a littl to better tell a coher stori about what under the staff forecast   furthermor  particular to the extent that the committe   s press announc on the polici decis becom less reveal  it would in my judgment be construct to speed the releas of the minut  perhap to the third thursday follow the meet  or just over two week after the meet  my next set of recommend relat to the fomc member    own forecast  now reveal twice a year in the tes oni and report on monetari polici   my first concern is that these forecast may not be develop as advertis   that is  the forecast is suppos to reflect appropri monetari polici from the perspect of each member   this is a veri weighti assign  especi if the forecast extend out beyond a year  perhap similar to the perfect foresight polici in the bluebook this  e   it might be help  therefor  if the bluebook includ such a forecast base on             perfect foresight in the polici relat materi   i think the committe member might want to discuss whether they   re prepar the forecast under this type of model and if not  whether and how to do so  second  these forecast in my view should alway cover a period of at least one and a half to two year   in particular  the forecast prepar each januari now extend onli to the end of that year  while the forecast prepar in june extend one and a half year   the januari forecast in my view should be extend to the end of the follow year  a two year period   now  i appreci that this recommend was consid and reject in        some member of the committe were concern at that  e that such an extens could allow the public to infer the committe   s object   should i repeat that   to my mind  this is an advantag   publish an extend forecast might requir more discuss by the chairman at his monetari polici tes oni and perhap by other committe member   that   s what transpar is all about  third  the abil of the forecast to serv as a rational for the committe   s decis is limit today becaus the committe   not reveal the assumpt under it consensus forecast and in particular the fund rate path   i understand that this is especi radic  but i would encourag the committe to consid reveal the central tendenc of the fund rate path that under it consensus forecast   i   d also suggest perhap look for other way to reveal the key assumpt under that forecast  final  i   d encourag the committe to consid increas the frequenc of such forecast from twice a year to four  e a year   this forecast provid a rational for the committe   s decis   and it is more import in this respect becaus of the absenc of a full statement that otherwis provid that rational   just as a pictur might be worth a thousand word  so might that be said of a forecast              let me conclud by repeat what i said dure my veri first meet in june        this has been even more fun than i expect it to be   it has been a privileg to serv on this committe  i   m certain fortun to have serv dure a  e that has been so interest and challeng   i   m fortun to have serv on this committe under the leadership of alan  span and with all of you   i   m fortun also to have had the except support of the staff  as i wrestl with the outlook and tri to make contribut to the polici discuss
we will obvious be consid your notion and i   ll appoint two or three peopl to be the proxi for you   it   s go to requir two or three peopl to do that    laughter   in ani case  i   m sure that in the week ahead there will be a lot of statement about your contribut to this committe   but i doubt that ani of us has to say veri much   i think we   re all acut awar of your accomplish    applaus   governor
i didn   t necessarili want to follow in this order   let me first say a word to my good friend  larri     i don   t alway agre with him  but he alway make us think  and i believ he has done that today   i   m frank a littl too tire to think about disclosur and transpar at this particular moment  but i agre that perhap we ought to consid that issu again  howev  i would say that late the fed seem to me to have been veri well understood by market  when a data seri come out  everyon say here is what the fed think about that and they   re usual not far wrong   so i think somehow or other we are communic fair well alreadi   that   s not to say we can   t do more  but i don   t think communic is a huge problem at this point  now  back to the chairman   s recommend   i agre with go down     point and with continu the bias toward weak   i think that   s about the right polici in level term   as i   ve said mani  e over the year  i   m not too worri about the revers issu   if we have to  we can do it   we have done it   also  in line with what bill pool said  this small step pave the way for an             order reposit of polici  which i think all of us want to do   the final thing i would say about the polici recommend is that  if i   m not mistaken  go down     point today would be follow exact the strategi built into the bluebook forecast in which the staff imput the so call perfect foresight polici   i think it would be pretti close to the way they   ve got us in their equat  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   hope we don   t all have to comment on transpar becaus i   m not go to   i am in agreement with your recommend   given the hard  e i had with the    basi point reduct last  e  some might ask how i could be and  frank  on the case for stand pat i think presid  n has some good argument   but as i view the data that have come out sinc the last meet  there are not onli glimmer of a turnaround but some enhanc downsid risk as well   i thought you cover them well in your statement  the trajectori of the unemploy rate  the euphoria in the stock market  the potenti for no fiscal polici or one that   s not effect in ani way like what is in our forecast  downturn in corpor profit  and so forth   so i see some new risk here   i agre with the statement that the risk are bias to the downsid  certain over the near term   so with that logic  i come down on the side of a    basi point declin in rate as you have suggest   in some way i think it is a measur of insur and in fact i   m hope that it is   i   m also hope that the posit we   re now see do turn out to outweigh the potenti for negat develop and that the next  e we meet polici will be stabl and the risk will be balanc
mr  chairman  i can accept your recommend  but i have a prefer for no chang at today   s meet   i would like to associ myself with presid  n   s comment              it seem to me that after eleven month of veri aggress front load eas and have been in an accommod stanc for some  e now  the degre of which we could argu about  we have the latitud to paus today   that   s not to say we can declar victori but i think we ought to paus and see how thing play out   peopl around the tabl have made the point that we   re veri like to see some more ugli data over the next coupl of month or next coupl of quarter   but i would argu that there is some consider valu in signal sever thing   one is that we are see some first sign  i underscor first  of stabil and that mani of the further adjust that still need to be made are not particular interest rate sensit   and final  have done what we can to cushion the slowdown over the cycl  we can send the messag that we have gotten back to  in fact have never gotten away  from  a focus on the op um long term polici    perhap the statement that you have craft will achiev much of that  but i think there is some signific valu today in make some of those point to the peopl who watch what we do   thank you  mr  chairman
i support your recommend  mr  chairman   the recoveri appear to be on track or at least visibl in the distanc   as you point out  the  e and magnitud of the recoveri depend on consum spend  which is still uncertain   and to counter the risk associ with that  i support further eas   i also support leav the risk statement weight toward econom weak at least at this  e   but i also feel that the word of the press announc is particular import this  e  so i look forward to see the craftsmanship
i   m glad it   s short    laughter   presid jordan
i agre with the view state by gari  n
mr  chairman  i realli think we ought to stay where we are   a   percent fed fund rate is s ul   we   ve cut the rate     basi point this year  which is veri aggress for us  and     basi point of that has been done sinc septemb   th   we are see some sign of improv and not all of the s ulus has come into play yet   while i recogn that inflat is not an immedi issu  and i appreci that  i still think we need to take a littl longer run view at this  e   so  i have to say i agre with gari  n   s comment
i can support your recommend  although i   d like to associ myself with the comment of gari  jerri  jack  and tom   i think this would have been a good  e to paus and no real harm would have come from it   it seem to me that it would be a good  e to signal to the market that they can   t get a cut everi  e they build one into the fed fund futur   on the risk statement  sinc we put it out we have to say that the risk are bias toward the downsid becaus they clear are   nevertheless  i continu to feel that have such a risk statement at everi meet is not serv us all that well becaus i think it   s almost alway interpret as one more eas move to go   so  eventu i think we ought to take anoth look at that practic   one addit way we might signal that we   re wind down other than the languag of the statement and the fact that the cut is    rather than    basi point  is to consid not reduc the discount rate
i might note that in fact that issu did come up and the general consensus  at least among the staff  is that it probabl would creat more uncertainti than otherwis   but it   s an interest idea
well  i   ve suggest it at the last two meet as well
i   m awar of that
it seem to me that our long run plan is to revers the posit of those two rate and that we   re miss a good opportun to get a head start on do that
i support the recommend  but i do also support the comment that other peopl have made about begin to signal that this may be one of our last eas action
