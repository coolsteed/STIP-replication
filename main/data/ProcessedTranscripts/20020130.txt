all in favor say    aye     sever   aye
approv without object   is there a nomin for someon to serv as vice chairman of the fomc
i nomin   j    of the new york feder reserv bank for vice chairman
okay   is there a second
all in favor say    aye     sever   aye
gentlemen  democraci has rule yet again   let me turn the floor over to the person who should actual run the meet  our re elect chairman
thank you   should i make an inaugur speech
if you feel so oblig
the first item of busi is to elect the staff offic of the committe   norm has a list of nomine  and i would appreci his read them
secretari and economist deputi secretari  assist secretari assist secretari  general counsel  deputi general counsel  economist  economist economist   associ economist from the board                          associ economist from the reserv bank      donald kohn  normand bernar gari gillum michell smith   mat thoma baxter    son   reinhart     thoma connor   howard        olin      christin cum loretta me  arthur rolnick harvey rosenblum mark sniderman
would somebodi like to move that slate
i   ll move the slate
without object   next  as you know  we need to select a feder reserv bank to execut transact for the system open market account   i believ the new york bank tradit has been the one select   would somebodi like to move that we continu that particular histor practic
i   ll move new york
thank you   is there a second   sever   second
good   i assum that there are no object   if there are  tell me later    laughter
we are prepar to serv  mr  chairman
i don   t recal ask you ani question  mr  vice chairman    laughter   the manag of the system open market account is current dino kos  i would entertain a nomin for him to continu to serv in that posit  subject to his appoint be satisfactori to the feder reserv bank of new york
without object   congratul  dino   i will now turn the floor over to dino for a discuss  if necessari  of the author and direct that we need to approv
thank you   first  on the domest side  we recommend that the committe reaffirm the author for domest open market oper and the guidelin for the conduct of system oper in feder agenc issu in their present form   i would note with regard to the    guidelin    that a reaffirm would involv the continu suspens of paragraph   to     this will allow us to continu to take mortgag back secur as collater in our domest open market oper  a practic we   ve engag in sinc octob
would somebodi like to move that
without object   you still have the floor  dino
on the foreign side  the desk oper under the follow committe instrument  the author for foreign currenc oper  the foreign currenc direct  and the procedur instruct with respect to foreign currenc oper   i recommend that they all be renew without amend
befor we go into a discuss on that  let me note that i have recent had convers with the secretari of the treasuri in which he reiter the treasuri   s posit with regard to foreign currenc intervent   it is about as close to our as you can get   the general view at treasuri is that the histori of intervent show clear that it has not been effect   and except under extraordinari circumst  which would be less econom and perhap more polit in an intern sens  there is no inclin on their part to do ani intervent   consequ  i think the discuss we   ve had with previous treasuri offici when we   ve had activist treasuri depart are not relev in this case   i can indic to you that as far as i can see i believ there is no need to be concern about problem aris with respect to differ we may have with treasuri about either intervent  or wareh   would anybodi wish to discuss this issu
mr  chairman  especi with that background  i enthusiast move approv
is there a second
i second it
i would like to make a comment on this   i am  of cours  veri pleas to hear that the prospect of intervent are veri low   it   seem to me  though  that some  condit chang and under the press of circumst peopl do thing that one wouldn   t have anticip   i think back particular to the most dramat exampl in my profession experi  the oft repeat statement of presid nixon and his peopl that wage and price control were out of the question   then sudden on august           we had wage and price control   i would like to see us posit ourselv so that in some futur circumst we might not be abl to imagin now it would take a special act of this committe to author ani such intervent   i recommend that we provid for that in order to reduc the probabl that we would  in fact  find ourselv interven in such a set of circumst
i would oppos our take such a measur  first becaus i don   t think it is necessari   inde  i   m sure it is not necessari   but more import  if we did   and of cours we   d make it public of necess   we would rais question that i don   t think this particular secretari of the treasuri and this treasuri depart deserv  if i may put it in those term   they are as strong oppos to intervent as we are   i don   t deni  obvious  that condit can chang   they are like to chang  howev  under circumst that would be extraordinari   at that particular point we alway have the abil to call a meet of this group   we could probabl do it in ten or fifteen minut i suspect   so if action are contempl that might seem appropri onli to certain circumst  i think we could act then   i don   t think it   s appropri to do it beforehand  frank   that   s my judgment anyway  presid jordan
a question   quit asid from interven in the narrow and short run sens  have your convers gotten into issu of long term consider about the appropri level of our hold of secur denomin in foreign currenc   we hold secur in two currenc right now  and we got it down to those two over a long period of  e   but we   ve just been sit with the inherit inventori of asset denomin in foreign currenc  and it  sn   t seem as if that is necessarili the right thing to be do
no  i think the treasuri would agre with that   their conclus  howev  is that the best thing to do is to leav it alon   from their point of view we should not do anyth one way or the other on the ground that  if we start to do someth in that regard  it impli that we   re open to other type of manipul   again  a circumst may aris where that may chang  but should it chang  sinc that clear would involv action that affect our balanc sheet  it would requir a discuss on our part to decid whether or not we wish to advis the treasuri otherwis or wish to act differ on our own behalf   ani further comment   if not  i would entertain a motion
i alreadi made it
sorri about that   you did  inde
it has been second   all in favor say    aye     sever      aye
oppos   the    aye    have it   would somebodi like to move the minut of our meet of decemb
thank you   without object  they are approv   dino kos  you have the floor again on open market oper
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were circul earlier this afternoon   the top panel of the first page show three month cash and forward dollar deposit rate  repres by the

the last few day  when it depreci more rapid   the most often cite reason is the belief that the u s  economi will recov sooner and more vigor than will the european economi  some technic factor may

the averag amount outstand stay in more stabl rang  with direct agenc collater  account for about a quarter of the collater  mortgag back secur somewhat more than that  and treasuri slight less than half of the total   by way of comparison  befor we expand the collater pool in octob      to includ mortgag back asset  the distribut between treasuri and agenc would vari wide   in the year befor go to the current system  agenc account for about    percent of the collater on rps   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to ratifi domest oper  and i would be happi to take ani question
question for dino   if not  vice chair
move approv of domest oper
thank you   without object  they are approv   we now move on to what hope is go to be a rather interest convers and i trust an academ one  but we never know about these thing   it is  of cours  a present on the zero bound issu with three briefer  sequenti   dave reifschneid       and marvin goodfriend      would you like to start us off
thank you  mr  chairman     and i will be share our brief this morn  and we will be refer to the materi that was hand out earlier entitl    board staff present on the implic of the zero bound on nomin interest rate      this afternoon  we will report on work that we have undertaken in the past few year on the implic for monetari polici of the zero bound on nomin interest rate   in these effort  we have benefit from research carri out by other at the board  the reserv bank  and economist outsid the system   with short term interest rate unusu low and the economi still weak  the question aris as to what might happen if further deterior were to set in  specif  might the committe find itself push the fund rate to zero in the near  futur  and wish it could do more  in an attempt to combat rise unemploy and fall inflat   your first exhibit present one scenario illustr how this might occur   we start with the extend staff outlook that appear in the bluebook  shown as the solid black line in the panel   in this baselin  as the economi continu to recov past       the need for monetari s ulus gradual diminish  and so the nomin fund rate rise to   percent by mid decad   now suppos share price were to drop almost    percent by this summer   a big drop to be sure  but one that would still leav the p e ratio for the s p    abov it histor averag   if the committe aggress respond to weaken activ and the impli fall in the economi   s equilibrium real rate  the nomin fund rate   the red line   would fall to zero quick   even so  and assum the fund rate remain at zero for two year  the frb us model predict that the unemploy rate would still continu to climb through      and would not fall below   percent until late        in respons to such heighten labor market slack  the downward trajectori of core cpi inflat would be more pronounc than in the baselin   as indic by the first bullet in the bottom panel  this scenario highlight a current vulner of monetari polici   in some plausibl futur situat  you may not be abl to take the nomin fund rate as low as you would like   so  while some deterior in econom perform follow a stock market crash would be inevit  the zero bound accentu the damag   this point is illustr in the top and middl panel by the blue line  which show what would happen if it were possibl to drive the fund rate below zero   in this imaginari world  the nomin fund rate turn negat for a  e  yield a smaller increas in the unemploy rate and less of a declin in inflat     materi use by mr  reifschneid and mr    are append to this document  appendix       the fact that price fall more rapid when polici is constrain by the zero bound has import consequ   the reason is that declin inflat with the nomin fund rate stuck at zero caus the real fund rate to rise   as the red line in the middl right panel show for late      through earli        this unintend polici tighten exacerb the rise in unemploy and under extrem condit can becom self reinforc   still  the economi in this exampl   eventu recov becaus the baselin outlook embodi strengthen demand and tighten monetari polici  so that after a  e the nomin fund rate is high enough to enabl polici to be quit s ul if necessari   even if not quit as much as you might like in all circumst   but if the baselin outlook were for a much weaker recoveri and instead show the nomin fund rate  say  remain flat at it current level  then the abil of the economi to right itself in the event of a major disturb would be call into question   your next exhibit take a more general look at the econom of the problem pose by the zero bound   in conduct our research  we have made three import assumpt   first  we assum that monetari polici affect real activ in the short   to medium run primarili through it abil to move the current and anticip level of the real fund rate and  therefor  real bond rate and other asset price through arbitrag   second  we assum that the so call quantiti effect of monetari polici are not that import  in particular  chang in the monetari base have littl or no direct influenc on real activ or inflat    i should note that marvin will have more to say on this subject    third  we assum that inflat display consider inertia and depend on inflat expect and the level of resourc util  among other factor   as note in the middl portion of the panel  under these assumpt the zero bound has three main effect   first  it limit the monetari s ulus that can be employ to offset a contractionari shock   if the nomin rate can go onli as low as zero  the real fund rate can be driven onli to the negat of the current inflat rate  second  the constraint on policymak action caus resourc util and the inflat rate both to move lower than they otherwis would in the wake of an advers shock   as was note earlier  if the situat is sever enough  this can becom a self reinforc downward spiral  with fall resourc util push inflat down further and fall inflat push real interest rate higher  put yet more downward pressur on resourc util   under extrem condit  this unintend eros in the real fund rate will continu uncheck to produc a deflationari trap   the practic import of this threat to stabil depend on sever factor   which are list in the bottom portion of the panel   first  the less respons are output and inflat to chang in the real fund rate  the greater the amount of maneuv room need to offset ani disturb that might come along   second  the greater the magnitud and persist of shock hit the economi  the greater the rang of fund rate variat requir to maintain stabl employ and inflat   third  the slower a central bank move to head off excess econom weak  the greater the risk that a deflationari spiral will develop   last  the lower the averag amount of room to adjust the fund rate  the greater the risk of be constrain by the zero bound   in part  the size of this averag cushion is outsid your control  becaus it depend on the real interest rate consist with stabl inflat and full employ in the long run   our so call r    howev  you can influenc the cushion   s size through your choic of how low to drive the averag rate of inflat   your next exhibit provid a quantit assess of the implic of the zero bound for econom stabil   this assess close follow the approach that we took two year ago in the paper that we prepar for the system confer on the subject and that was distribut to you last week   as note in the upper panel  our goal is to es  the effect on averag econom perform of lower the target rate of inflat which  as i just note  influenc the relev of the zero bound  our approach to es  these effect is to simul frb us  subject to random  shock similar to those experienc over the past thriti five year   in these simul  we assum that household and firm form their expect in a forward look manner that take full account of the systemat behavior of monetari polici   by simul the model over and over  we can compil a larg set of pseudo    histori    of the economi  from which we calcul statist on averag  perform   we run each of these simul under the assumpt that monetari polici respond to chang in econom condit accord to the taylor rule  in which the nomin fund rate  denot by    i     is set equal to the sum of four term    the equilibrium real interest rate r   the rate of inflat  one half the current output gap  and one half the differ between actual and target inflat   two main lesson from this exercis are summar in the middl panel   first  at low target rate of inflat  the fund rate fall to zero frequent   this can be seen in line   of the tabl at the bottom of the page  which show the percent of  e the fund rate is at zero for three differ core cpi inflat target     percent    percent  and   percent   our simul policymak put the nomin fund rate at zero near    percent of the  e with an inflat target of zero  but onli about    percent of the  e with an inflat target of   percent and onli   percent of the  e if the target is   percent   return to the middl panel  the second lesson to come out of these simul is that econom perform deterior in our model when the inflat target is below   percent or so   one manifest of this deterior is an increas in the variabl of the unemploy rate  shown in line    of the tabl   as the target inflat rate rise from zero to   percent  the standard deviat of the unemploy rate drop sharpli from     to     percentag point  but a further increas in the inflat target to   percent has onli a small effect on the standard deviat of the unemploy rate   a similar break in perform at an inflat target of about   percent is evid in line    which show the frequenc of deep recess   here  the number of major downturn expect per     year fall from    to about     when the inflat target is rais from zero to   percent but then slip by onli a small amount if the target is rais further to   percent   although these numer result are specif to the frb us model  other model yield qualit similar find       will now continu our present
under the taylor rule  policymak would need to weigh the deterior in econom perform associ with the zero bound against the benefit of lower inflat in establish an overal price object   and to be sure  not all of those benefit are captur by the model   the exist of a tradeoff rais  the question of whether there are other way to design polici so as to mitig the effect of the zero bound in a low inflat environ   that is the subject of your next exhibit   accord to previous research  polici that are more respons to fluctuat in output than the taylor rule do a better job of stabil the economi  modest increas the respons of the fund rate to deviat in inflat from it target also appear benefici   there are two aspect to this advantag   first  such rule reduc the probabl that inflat will be well below it target if and when a major disturb hit the economi  and thus they essenti take away one of the ingredi of a deflationari spiral   a second advantag of such rule is that they reduc the fund rate quick when the economi weaken  therebi limit the sever of major downturn  again reduc the risk of deflat   the middl tabl put some numer magnitud on these advantag   for this exercis  we assum that the more respons rule react twice as strong to movement in the output gap as the standard taylor rule but is the same in it other dimens   as can be seen by compar line   and    the more respons rule damp fluctuat in unemploy relat to the taylor rule   and as shown on line   and    the more respons rule is also more effect at keep the economi out of deep recess   in fact  the more respons rule under a zero inflat target is abl to match or better the perform of the taylor rule use a higher inflat target   howev  as was the case with the taylor rule  perform under the more respons rule drop off notic when the target is reduc below   percent but improv littl when the target is increas to   percent   as note in the bottom panel  adopt more respons rule   especi one with even greater sensit to econom condit than the rule analyz here    bring some potenti disadvantag as well   first  the greater respons of polici to chang in econom condit impli heighten variabl of the fed fund rate and more frequent polici revers   although these differ have no direct implic for econom perform in the frb us analysi  they may be a caus of concern for reason not captur by our model   second  implement a more aggress respons to the es  output gap amplifi the risk and magnitud of polici mistak owe to faulti data and mismeasur of the economi   s product capac   last  becaus more aggress rule drive the fed fund rate quick to zero when the economi weaken and rate are alreadi low  they increas the risk of trigger a confid crisi if investor becom unnerv whenev the fed has no more latitud for move the fed fund rate down further  howev  such possibl effect on confid play no role in the frb us model   for these reason  the fomc might want to consid polici that becom more respons onli when it is in immin danger of hit the zero bound   such asymmetr respons is the subject of your next exhibit   as describ in the upper panel  to illustr this idea we consid a polici that under most condit follow the standard taylor rule but that lower the fed fund rate more quick when econom condit are suffici bleak   in particular  we assum that whenev the standard taylor rule would prescrib a fund rate below   percent  the fund rate is automat set to zero   such a polici has the advantag share by general more respons rule of quick bring to bear the maximum monetari s ulus possibl to offset econom downturn or deflat  thus enhanc averag econom perform   at the same  e  the cost of higher interest rate variabl and the risk of polici mistak are lessen becaus the greater respons of polici is limit to episod of econom distress   the middl tabl compar econom perform under the asymmetr polici to that obtain with the taylor rule   with an inflat target of   percent  the taylor rule onli occasion prescrib a fund rate below   percent  so the overal perform of the two polici differ littl   but with a lower inflat target  the asymmetr polici mitig the falloff in perform result from the zero bound without signific rais the overal variabl of the fed fund rate   as shown in line   and    under the asymmetr rule the increas in the variabl of the unemploy rate is less when the inflat target is lower from   percent to zero   line   and   show a similar result for the frequenc of deep recess   as note in the bottom panel  one possibl drawback of the asymmetr rule is that it may be less transpar   in particular  communic the natur of such a polici to investor may be difficult  and the market may have troubl understand it full ramif   this is becaus an asymmetr polici  unlik the taylor rule or similar strategi    not alway respond to econom condit in the same manner   thus  the privat sector might mistaken interpret a sudden drop in the fed fund rate as a temporari aberr rather than a systemat aspect of the rule   this transpar problem could prevent the rule   s benefit from materi if investor do not correct incorpor the implic of asymmetr behavior into their expect  in particular by price into bond yield the greater probabl of a zero fund rate dure econom slowdown   your next exhibit consid anoth strategi for mitig the effect of the zero bound   this approach  unlik the strategi that we have discuss so far  respond not onli to current inflat but also take into account past deviat of inflat from target   a key featur of such a strategi is that it involv a promis to keep the fund rate unusu low follow an episod in which the zero bound constrain polici   one specif exampl of this approach is price level target  in which polici is set so that the price level rather than the inflat rate fluctuat around a predetermin target path   under price level target  investor expect that ani shortfal of the price level from it target will be made up later  so that a period of low inflat will be follow by an offset period of high inflat  and vice versa   polici that promis abov averag futur rate of inflat creat the expect that the futur stanc of monetari polici will be relat easi for a  e   thus  even with the fund rate present constrain at zero  this expect about futur polici contribut to expect of higher futur inflat and relat low fund rate   as a result  real bond rate fall today and s ul real activ   this effect on expect thus reduc the sever of recess and lower the danger of deflat   such polici have attract a great deal of attent by some research and have been advoc as a possibl strategi for the bank of japan in it current situat   model base research  includ work carri out use the frb us model  find that under the assumpt of ration expect and perfect polici credibl  these polici can be veri effect in reduc the stabil cost associ with the zero bound   howev  the effect of such polici depend crucial on that credibl   on investor    expect be consist with the promis polici  under certain condit  investor may doubt whether policymak will in fact carri through on their pledg   for exampl  the public may question whether policymak would realli activ seek to bring about high inflat follow a period of low inflat  or vice versa  rather than be satisfi with just stabil the inflat rate at the long run target   if investor don   t believ the promis  then real bond rate will not come down  and therefor such strategi will be ineffect at mitig the effect of the zero bound    your final exhibit list the main lesson from this line of research   first  in a veri low inflat environ  the nomin fund rate can be expect to hit zero relat frequent   but in general  such an event is not an insurmount problem   the economi usual recov despit the constraint on polici becaus most econom disturb are suffici transitori and modest in magnitud   that said  if deflat set in  the abil of the economi to recov can be jeopard  fund rate base monetari polici can mitig the effect of the zero bound in sever way   by not pursu too low a rate of averag inflat  by respond relat aggress to chang in econom condit  and by promis higher inflat down the road in the event that the fund rate get stuck at zero   final  it pay to s ul the economi aggress when the probabl of hit the zero bound is high  at least from the perspect of the frb us model  there is no advantag in    keep your powder dri      that conclud our prepar remark

i would recommend  mr  chairman  that marvin complet his present and then we can address question
okay   marvin
thank you  mr  chairman   i recogn that think about what monetari polici can do at the zero bound on nomin interest rate is a kind of third rail of monetari polici   as is the case with social secur  the various propos of possibl altern provok strong reaction  reaction that are reminisc of the keynesian monetarist controversi of old about fiscal and monetari polici   with that acknowledg  i offer my assess of some of the option   i will spend most of my  e explain how what i think is the best option   expand the monetari base   could work to s ul the economi at the zero bound   i will discuss five other option briefli at the end of my present   i plan to follow close the materi that you should have in front of you   so  pleas turn to page   and follow along from there   usual  open market oper are constrain to accommod the demand for the monetari base at the opportun cost spread between the intend feder fund rate and zero   there is a need to defend an interest rate spread when the feder fund rate is posit  and as a result  the monetari base is not an independ instrument avail for polici in those normal circumst   but onc the feder fund rate is zero  there is no need to defend an interest rate spread  and policymak are free to expand the monetari base further to s ul the economi   central bank can pursu what i call quantit monetari polici   as distinguish from interest rate polici   at the zero bound   as note on page    to appreci the power of quantit polici at the zero bound  we need to distinguish between narrow and broad liquid servic   in model of the demand for money  narrow liquid servic are provid by the medium of exchang  which allow bank and the public to econom on transact cost or so call shop  e cost   for exampl  peopl hold currenc to minim trip to the atm  they hold checkabl deposit to avoid sale of nonmonetari asset in order to replenish money balanc and make payment  and bank hold reserv to save on transact cost in  the feder fund market   when short term nomin interest rate are at zero  narrow liquid servic of the kind i just describ are no longer scarc becaus there is no opportun cost of hold currenc or bank reserv  and the channel of monetari polici transmiss that we ordinarili use is exhaust   broad liquid servic are not exhaust  howev  and they provid what i will  argu is the leverag for quantit monetari polici to s ul the economi further at the zero bound   let me first defin what i mean by broad liquid   broad liquid is a servic yield provid by asset accord to how easili they can be turn into cash  either by their sale or by serv as collater for extern financ     materi use by mr  goodfriend are append to this document  appendix      broad liquid servic are valu  page    becaus they minim the exposur of household and firm to what i call the extern financ premium   that premium is a consequ of imperfect inform  cost enforc  and cost monitor of loan contract that creat a wedg between the cost of fund rais extern and those generat intern   the exist of an extern financ premium give rise to a demand for broad liquid asset that over  e has been refer to in the profess as    precautionari save        a liquid buffer stock     or    self insur     broad monetari instrument includ bank deposit  money market mutual fund share  and short term govern secur   these could be use to meet spend need in excess of current incom   in other word  to protect household and firm from have to go to bank or credit market to borrow and thus pay the extern financ premium   turn to page    quantit monetari polici at the zero bound must expand broad liquid in order to be s ul becaus s ulus from narrow liquid is no longer avail   open market purchas of short term govern secur  the usual vehicl for an expans monetari polici  would creat a monetari base by withdraw from the system an equal valu of short term govern secur   at zero interest  the liquid servic provid by base money and short term secur would be rough equival   so  if the central bank oper in a    busi as usual    mode  that would not increas broad liquid in the economi   other method of oper must be employ   there are three avenu that could be pursu to increas broad liquid by expand the feder reserv   s balanc sheet   one would be to buy from the public relat illiquid asset such as long term govern bond  which would provid the public with base money that would then be deposit in bank   the bank system would expand  deposit would grow  and the bank would hold reserv against these addit deposit   it   s import to understand that even if bank do not use these reserv to expand lend   and thus there is no secondari expans of bank deposit   the fed has increas broad monetari liquid in the economi as a result of it purchas of relat illiquid long term bond on the open market  altern  the fed could buy asset other than long term govern bond    anyth one can imagin that is relat illiquid   and in that way also increas broad liquid   the third way would be to monet a govern budget deficit  that would involv the govern   s issu new short term secur  say  which the fed would buy   we would therebi be provid the govern with a monetari base  which in turn it would transfer to the public through a tax cut or in some other way   the fund place in the hand of the public would be deposit in the bank system and deposit would increas  as would broad liquid   on page    i discuss the channel of monetari transmiss by which quantit polici might be expect to work   the two compon of the transmiss mechan are the portfolio rebalanc channel and the credit channel   i will discuss those two channel sequenti  though you will see in a minut that to a larg extent they are intertwin   by expand broad liquid in the economi the feder reserv reduc what i   m go to call the    margin implicit broad liquid  servic yield on monetari asset      the implicit margin liquid yield fall becaus a greater abund of broad liquid reduc the exposur of household and firm to the extern financ premium  the portfolio rebalanc channel oper this way   after an inject of broad liquid that drive down it implicit yield  peopl will feel compel to hold asset that are less liquid but have a higher explicit rate of return   portfolio balanc would requir a similar fall in the explicit yield on nonmonetari asset   equilibrium price of nonmonetari asset would be bid up to restor the requir return differenti   turn to page    higher asset price rais desir consumpt out of current incom   and higher asset price relat to their cost of product would reviv invest   the increas invest would rais employ  and higher util rate and profit would rais asset price further   that is the essenc of the portfolio rebalanc channel   let me talk for a minut about the credit channel  page      becaus asset price are higher  collater valu would be higher  net worth would be higher  and bank capit would be higher   as a result of the higher valuat avail to back loan  the extern financ premium would come down   credit spread would narrow  bank  lend would reviv  and spend would rise as the cost of borrow against futur incom prospect fall   those develop would occur along with the portfolio rebalanc channel  but i call them the credit channel becaus they are distinct in that they oper in the credit market   turn to page     i want to note two implement problem that i think would be hard to overcom   even if the transmiss mechan outlin abov work well otherwis  these two problem would hinder make the broad liquid channel oper   inject of monetari base can provid an impuls to get the recoveri go  but for the recoveri to be self sustain the public must be confid that base money will be expand by as much and for as long as need   that is  monetari polici must be support until the economi expand enough to support asset price on it own   to acquir such credibl  the central bank must overcom the percept that it is excess concern about the inflationari risk of potenti veri high growth in the monetari base   the monetari author must be prepar to overshoot   perhap by a wide margin   base money that will be demand at stabl price after the economi recov   there is a second relat  but distinct  implement problem that would make gain credibl for quantit polici difficult   ordinarili  relat small chang in bank reserv suffic to support interest rate polici   we hard have to move the system   s balanc sheet at all to support even larg chang in the intend feder fund rate   at the zero bound  howev  polici will have to exert it effect through broad liquid rather than veri narrow reserv liquid   what we   re talk about is oper on a monetari aggreg like m    which is rough around   trillion dollar   plus the stock of short term treasuri secur  which involv anoth    trillion to    trillion   the order of magnitud of that aggreg is about that of gdp   that will requir larg scale inject of monetari base  substanti increas the size of the feder reserv   s balanc sheet  i believ  in order to have the desir effect through the two broad liquid channel of monetari transmiss   if all this is true  the feder reserv will need more fiscal support for quantit polici at the zero bound than we usual are grant by the fiscal author  for one  there might not be enough long term bond to buy in order to expand the monetari base   of cours  we could buy other asset   but either way the feder reserv would be expos to capit loss that might leav it with insuffici asset to revers the huge expans of it balanc sheet that is be contempl   in other word  to be will to use quantit monetari polici at the zero bound  the central bank must be abl to inject larg quantiti of base money into the economi and be confid that it will have the asset to drain this money after the economi has recov   in particular  we   d need to be abl to drain money that threaten to becom inflationari  or we would be reluct to embark on this process in the first place   the fiscal author could come into the process in a number of way  page      they could promis to transfer to us enough asset   in effect to recapit the central bank if necessari   to allow us to drain the amount of base money that need to be withdrawn from the economi   altern  the fiscal author could agre to run a budget deficit at the central bank   s request to help us inject broad liquid into the economi   the central bank could monet short term debt issu to financ the deficit and then withdraw excess base money later by sell that debt to the public   quantit monetari polici action at the zero bound could result in a signific increas in govern debt in the hand of the public when this process is over   the fiscal author might be unwil to allow the public debt to expand at the discret of the central bank   yet the central bank might be unwil to pursu an aggress expans of it balanc sheet without a commit from the fiscal author to support monetari polici fulli   a prearrang agreement could enabl quantit polici to work credibl  flexibl  and effect   at least the way this stori goe   that conclud my discuss of quantit polici at the zero bound   in my remain  e  i would like to discuss briefli five other polici option   the first option     do noth unusu     page     involv keep the feder fund rate at zero without increas the monetari base ani more than would be necessari to do so   as dave and   point out  the contract would like be deeper than usual becaus we   d be constrain at zero   but i want to point out two other risk that i think would aris that are not ordinarili discuss in convent simul    one is that if we have a distress bank system  bank would provid insid broad liquid much less elast than usual   ordinarili  bank would accommod an increas demand for broad liquid by accept deposit and make relat illiquid loan   that is  they would reintermedi the fund   if bank capit is impair  bank may instead buy treasuri secur with new deposit   if they do  bank would not be accommod the increas demand for broad liquid at all   they would accept the deposit but would withdraw other instrument that would have been provid broad liquid in order to hold those asset on their own balanc sheet   in that case an excess demand for broad liquid  which could be substanti in a depress situat at the zero bound  would work the monetari transmiss process in revers   the excess demand would not be met by the feder reserv in this    do noth unusu    case nor by the bank  and that excess demand for broad liquid would depress asset price and spend   that is one problem with do noth unusu   a second is that a polici vacuum would occur  which could encourag ill advis fiscal action   some fiscal action may be benefici  but mani would not be   for instanc  the govern might enact legisl that result in wast govern spend  ineffici credit subsidi  or forbear in the bank system in connect with deposit insur   as the debt gdp ratio rise  the govern might resort to off budget fiscal polici such as anti competit measur to help wage and price in particular sector   all told  such action could lower the level of potenti gdp and it rate of growth  as they appear to have done in the unit state in the     s and in japan in the     s  what i   m argu is that    do noth      not mean that noth get done   it mean that the ball would be in the court of the fiscal author  and we   re not sure what would happen in that case   a second possibl  page     is that the feder reserv could commit to hold the feder fund rate at zero by write option on futur short rate to give  itself an incent to keep rate down in the futur   dave and   mention this briefli   that possibl has the advantag of act direct on long term rate  the disadvantag is that the effect would be relat small if long term rate are close to zero anyway   as they are  for exampl  in japan today   there is anoth problem in that i think the credibl of ani commit to keep rate low would be doubt  given the pressur to take interest rate action deem appropri at each point in  e   anoth option  page     is that the feder reserv could buy foreign asset or depreci the foreign exchang rate or both   though differ  i   ve group these action togeth becaus they both make use of open   for instanc  we could buy foreign govern secur to help increas broad liquid as part of a polici packag design to stabil domest econom condit  such a program need not have ani effect per se on the exchang rate   the advantag is that we alreadi are author to make such purchas  and if we could do that in lieu of buy long term bond  it would help us perhap to oper independ of our own fiscal author   one problem  as with the acquisit of ani non treasuri secur  is that we would bear the credit and price risk   in this case  the exchang rate risk  separ  we could depreci the exchang rate  which has the advantag that it is a  well known and readili understood polici that has been tri around the world   the disadvantag from the u s  perspect is that our economi is veri larg and not all that open  so we could export deflat and recess without help the domest economi veri much   move on  the expand credit polici option  page     would call for increas discount window lend and the purchas of privat debt   that would reduc privat credit spread and help to financ credit constrain firm   the advantag is that we have wide latitud to lend to bank on collater   we would need new legisl to buy privat debt  but by all account our current abil to lend through the discount window would be suffici to accomplish our object   howev  i believ that the central bank would make a poor financi intermediari   i would argu that a central bank should use credit polici spare and temporarili onli to fo  stabil in financi market but not for general polici s ulus   it is worth rememb that quantit monetari polici  as i discuss earlier  work part through the credit channel   quantit monetari polici would go a long way toward facilit intermedi in the privat sector by rais collater valu and net worth and reduc the extern financ premium   it is possibl  therefor  that the central bank could improv the flow of credit in the economi at the zero bound without becom a financi intermediari itself  which i believ is an import factor to bear in mind   the last option  page     is that the central bank could pursu deliber an inflationari polici   again a possibl rais by dave and     base on my discuss of the broad liquid channel of monetari transmiss  i believ that quantit monetari polici could s ul the economi at the zero bound without creat inflat or inflat expect   temporari inflat would be desir to revers prior deflat that rais the real valu of nomin debt   howev  unleash inflat could be counterproduct  if such a polici were util routin near the zero bound  then expect inflat would rise ani  e that the feder fund rate approach zero   rise inflat expect would be destabil and difficult to manag  just as inflat scare in the bond market have been difficult to manag in the past   so  i don   t think that we would either need or want to creat inflat to tri to overcom the zero bound problem   that conclud my remark   i would be happi to answer ani question
that was a veri interest and percept set of paper  let me start off with some question   you indic that the result of your model   and  inde  implicit the result of marvin goodfriend   s model   are peculiar to the individu model in the  sens that the structur of the model obvious determin the outcom   what vari are the coeffici that are put into it   you mention that other model gave similar result  but the obvious point is that if they   re structur similar to the model you have and they don   t produc similar result  somebodi made an arithmet error   and that   s not terribl inform  i   m a littl curious to get from the three of you a sens of how robust you believ the result and your conclus are   for one  you   re oper general outsid the scope for which the data are fit in your model  and of necess there   s a linear that is implicit in the structur of your model   veri serious question aris as to whether in fact  as you approach some of these bound  linear is the appropri presumpt regard how economi function   veri specif  one issu that i think marvin rais indirect is that there is a conceiv possibl that these function  even if they are nonlinear  are smooth and increment and that the first differ don   t vari all that much from one period to the next  but we   re not sure of that   there may in fact be a discontinu at some point  in which case we may build up a signific amount of inflationari tinder in a deflationari environ  noth happen for a  e  but then the tinder ignit in a way that induc a veri dramat revers from deflat to inflat   that creat all sort of instabl   so i   m frank curious to get a sens from you  after have simul the model as much as you have and have an obvious advert to other structur and other relationship  as to how robust you gentlemen perceiv your result to be   to a certain extent  marvin   s result are almost an account system   i believ you   re mere describ the mechan by which we can chang the monetari base  marvin  and those are essenti the result of our institut structur   we could go ahead as a central bank and just print money and buy asset   we could buy basebal team for all we need   and we can generat as much currenc as we want   so the conclus of the three of you  are fair specif  and they impli that your model depict how the real world would work   i   m curious to get your impress not of what the standard deviat of your simul off the exist structur is but what the standard deviat of your model is from realiti    laughter
one of the unnerv thing about work on this is exact the problem that you point to at first  which is that we have model that were fit over a period where we didn   t hit the zero bound at ani point in  e   now we   re run simul in which we drive the nomin fed fund rate into a region where there   s a veri pronounc nonlinear  the zero bound   when we run the model   and as you said  it   s a most linear model  although we can run it in way that have certain nonlinear in it   at that point it   s not linear  and all sort of odd thing start happen   we worri a lot about how far to push these result and how general applic they are becaus certain chang to the model can make the problem less sever and certain chang to the model can make the problem a lot more sever  we list some of those at the begin of our remark  if you think that the economi in term of real activ is a lot more interest sensit than we have built into the model  then you   d be more sanguin about the zero bound problem   in  that regard i   m fair confid that we   re probabl okay becaus interest sensit in our model  if anyth  tend to be on the high side of what a lot of peopl think   the area in which we often get into the most discuss with other peopl about whether we   ve got it right is inflat dynam in the model   if you think that inflat dynam don   t work this way and you believ that some other mechan come into play   and one possibl here is that increas the growth in the monetari base would have a direct effect on inflat expect    that   s a veri differ world than the one portray by the model   in term of expect    how peopl would respond to rate hit the zero bound and what they would think about  where polici is go   we have agent behav veri ration in the model   under some condit  these ration expect stabil the system  and under some circumst they actual lead the system to instabl becaus peopl look at the situat and say    oh my  heaven  policymak are get themselv into a problem that they can   t get out of      in run the simul  in order to keep the model from crash into    great depress    scenario when expect becom this pessimist  we have to have oper in the background the assumpt that under veri extrem condit the fiscal author come to the rescu  under other expect assumpt it is possibl to have a situat where the  problem would be less sever becaus peopl don   t realiz the troubl they could get into   they don   t realiz the implic of the situat  and that particular form of ignor or rule of thumb behavior is actual stabil   one can envis other exampl where peopl extrapol forward and don   t see the potenti for get out of this difficulti in some of the way we discuss  and as a result thing are a lot wors  so my general remark on this is that we did the best we could  though we   re extrem  uncertain about what would actual take place at the zero bound   our onli real guid is to look back at either the great depress of the unit state or at the more recent experi of japan   take the japanes experi  we at least know that if we hit the zero bound it lead to a poorer macro perform than we would like   so in that sens we think it   s a real problem  whether it   s as sever as it becom in some of our simul is someth i   m not so sure about
one point that dave rais that is crucial in think about model base analysi is that we are use an es  model on thirti five year of data dure which we have not seen a period when the zero bound was a constraint   nonlinear may pop up dure recess for short period of  e but are not a domin featur of the data in term of their averag behavior   so we realli are push the envelop a bit with respect to what a model can do   and we recogn that   one of the question that peopl often ask in think about this is  are we get enough recess  or is our model too stabl   and in fact  as dave mention and as we describ in our paper  we get some whopper recess or depress in this model   the shock that we have in our simul i don   t think grossli overst or underst the risk to econom perform   but whether the economi would behav as the frb us or ani other model predict in a situat like that  we just don   t know  in larg part becaus we just don   t have that experi to incorpor into the model
in a way  my discuss had an advantag in that i didn   t have a model    laughter
you have doubl entri bookkeep  which is better than some of the account practic we   ve heard about recent    laughter
i will say that the discontinu   though i didn   t use that word    worri me   there were a number of possibl discontinu that worri me  such as bank system distress or fiscal intervent   thing that don   t usual happen but that occur at the zero bound   that   s whi i was focus on mechan that could get money into and out of the system   i was think about how we would posit ourselv against this kind of unleash of inflat   that   s the term i use   rather than    punt    on where that glass ceil would be   i want to think about design a system that would be robust against it   that is more or less what i was do
thank you  mr  chairman   i also think that these paper are excel  includ the paper on    lesson from japan   s experi      i   d like to ask a question   marvin  on your quantit polici at the zero bound altern  it   s interest to me to think of it in the context of japan   s experi   suppos the perform of the japanes economi is similar to that project in the  book   a forecast of deflat in japan in everi quarter for the next two year   as a result of all the problem that we   ve seen  peopl have begun to question what the real equilibrium interest rate is in japan at the present  e and what has happen to the trend of growth rate potenti   it seem to me that a quantit polici may run into particular problem becaus the real rate of return on cash   on not lend it out   is posit in a deflationari period   in contrast  there   s a lot of uncertainti  given all the travail they   ve run into  about what the rate of return are on other asset   could you relat this to japan  pleas
yes  japan has gone so far down the road that  you   re right  it   s veri hard to imagin that it could dig itself out with quantit polici   but i   ll say this   as i was work on this  i was motiv by the current situat in japan   i think there are a number of point of contact where i could see what i   ve been talk about happen in the japanes situat   the first is that if the bank of japan were go to engag in quantit polici   if it were will to expand the size of it balanc sheet by as much as i believ would be necessari to be effect   i believ it would need to get some prior commit from the fiscal author that it would be abl to pull the money out later   as you know  the bank of  japan was made independ from the ministri of financ just two or three year ago   i think it   s hard for them to get back togeth and cooper when they   ve spent a good deal of the last  fifteen year tri to get a divorc   so that   s one problem   as a central banker  i have some sympathi with the boj situat on that score   i   ll get to your rate of return question last  that   s the most difficult  the next issu is the bank situat   much of the problem in japan is not a central bank problem  it   s a fiscal bank regul problem   if i were a central banker in japan  i would be will to pursu quantit monetari polici aggress if i could get two commit from the ministri of financ   one  for the fiscal author to support monetari polici along the line of my earlier discuss and  two  for the fiscal author to deal with the problem in the bank system  to get to your last point  it   s true that as the deflat gather speed  it   s harder to get out of this jam   but the mechan i was talk about   the margin upon which quantit polici would oper   would still be there   the implicit shadow broad liquid servic yield would be still there   in fact  it may be bigger in japan than it has been for a long  e becaus the valu of have liquid is much higher now than previous   that is the case  in turn  becaus the extern financ premium is elev as a consequ of the fact that asset valuat are depress and loan are more cost to monitor and enforc  therefor  i believ that there would be a substanti shadow margin for japanes monetari polici to exploit if the boj were to do quantit polici in the way i was suggest
mr  chairman  like everybodi els  i found these studi to be enorm interest and veri benefici to my own think   i do think that we have a problem  as you suggest  in that we don   t have ani episod over the last thirti five year with which to compar this   so we look at the great depress or we look at the situat in japan  i think the mistak that were made in the great depress are suffici known that we can be hope that we wouldn   t make those mistak again   i alway have a great deal of difficulti in think that we could possibl learn anyth from the japanes experi   i say that becaus if we look just at monetari polici  there   s an impress that the rest of the economi and the japanes societi are realli quit similar to our when in fact they are not   the greatest competit advantag the unit state has is that we have the most flexibl economi in the world   it could easili be argu that the japanes have the least flexibl economi in the world   and if one compar the two bank system  it is clear that the bank system in japan has never been veri strong even in it best day  wherea our   certain at the moment   is extrem strong   the qualiti of banker in japan  in term of their be abl to analyz a credit and understand how it is like to be repaid  is extraordinarili low  wherea in fact in this countri we have some veri good banker   on occas in ani democraci one is challeng to ask if the elect offici realli are dedic to the good of the peopl   in the case of the unit state of america  the answer to that is clear    yes     wherea i think the elect offici in japan are demonstr interest in onli one thing and that is be re elect   therefor  i think their patriot is open to consider question   so i realli don   t think that the japanes experi tell us veri much  we don   t even have to go into the self congratulatori area of compar the relat qualiti of the central bank becaus that probabl would be unkind  i have a bit of difficulti in deal with some of marvin   s thought   not the recommend   i think there   s a certain point  when there is a degre of togeth between the central bank and the treasuri  at which the central bank   s independ has long sinc becom a thing of the past   leav asid that institut we at the feder reserv probabl wouldn   t like that  i think the american peopl would notic that  and there would be a tremend loss of confid in the system as a whole   i think that   s a price that we shouldn   t pay  i   d say that my princip interest is in the recommend for monetari polici that stem  from this research   if i   m right in my think  the reifschneid   paper lead  after a veri good analysi of the problem  to the follow three recommend on monetari polici  aim for a long run averag inflat rate that is not too low  respond aggress to movement in inflat and output  and pursu polici that promis higher inflat follow zero bound episod   let me assum that that   s pretti close to what you   ve conclud  as for the first recommend   aim for a long run averag inflat rate that   s not too low   we actual alreadi do that   there are occasion effort by my distinguish friend mr  parri and one or two other to suggest that we take advantag of the opportun to drive the inflat rate lower   and as an admir of hope conquer experi  i think it is good to discuss that everi now and then   but clear  there is no mood on this committe to drive the inflat rate down to   percent or     percent  say  and get near the area that mani of us would find  for the reason you cite  to be a littl danger   let me go to the second recommend  which is to respond aggress to movement in inflat and output   in both direct the committe in recent year has shown an incred willing to act aggress and high preemptiv   therefor  i think we   re do that also  as for deliber pursu polici that promis higher inflat follow zero bound episod  i actual believ in do that   to me the question is  do we go about give speech about it   if we did  i think we   d have the problem that a number of us have been concern about for some  e  and that is the issu of whether to have a formal numer inflat target  my own view is that if there is to be such a thing  it should be establish by the congress   and i   d rather not have the congress do that becaus i believ the peopl of the unit state have been serv veri well by the fact that in our mind  and not necessarili way to the back of our head  we do have an inflat target   it   s not a numer target but a movabl one   it   s the  spanian definit of whether peopl are think of inflat as they make their decis  that   s the kind of inflationari target i like   so  after consid the staff analysi of the problem and their recommend  i came to the conclus that we   re so close to where the research staff suggest we should be that i   m not sure what in addit the staff would want us to do   at long last  that   s my question
i think i agre   i   ll speak for myself and   can chime in    with everyth you said   one point we deliber didn   t emphas in our present is that follow the general more aggress rule produc behavior for the last year that look remark like the declin in the fed fund rate that actual occur   now  i   m not say that that   s how monetari polici was made last year   but it just so happen that if you had been use that kind of rule and you thought that was how polici behav  you wouldn   t have been surpris by the speed at which the fed fund rate came down in        so in that sens  your view is broad consist with the model we present  second  the committe probabl would never want to go as low as the zero inflat target for core cpi shown in our exampl becaus of the bias in it and for all sort of other reason   and if you thought that core pce inflat of     percent seem okay  well that   s equival to the   percent that we were talk about   so that   s the same   final  i don   t know how enthusiast we realli are about the promis to run higher inflat down the road that we show as one strategi   i think our view would be that it certain wouldn   t hurt  and at least it would be better than some of the public statement made by bank of japan offici when they assur the public that they weren   t go to let inflat get out of hand   i   m not sure there was much point in say that   i suspect it was counterproduct  although it may not have done ani great harm   in ani event  it   s not wise for the central bank to say that it is in favor of stay with a zero inflat target under those deflationari circumst
i   m a littl confus about one thing   i could see that reflat would be benefici if there had been a prior deflat   but are you argu that even if there were no prior deflat you would want to set up expect of inflat as a way to help us out of a zero bound situat   i might disagre in that second case
to be clear on the analysi that we did in our paper and that we talk about here today  run at that higher inflat rate was realli just to repair the damag that had occur becaus of the zero bound   so whether or not we had inflat or deflat didn   t determin what we did   if inflat were below where you would have had it for your polici rule becaus of the zero bound  you would offset that through an easier polici for a while   so your averag inflat would still be right  but you would not be inflat just to inflat
i want to note first of all  without go into ani detail about the lesson we may or may not have learn from japan  that the relev of the japanes experi for so call quantit polici is clear becaus it hasn   t been tri   japanes money growth  as i understand it  never exceed   percent in the past decad  and for most of the     s it was a good bit less than   percent   and in the     s it was more like   percent or close to it   so what japan did was to allow money growth to sag as the countri went into a period of ongo recess and the bank of japan never attempt to use quantit polici to get out   so we don   t know from the japanes experi whether that is go to work or not   in fact  the japanes experi would be consist with a tradit chicago view  which say that the economi can fall into a depress if money growth is allow to be too low for too long  now let me ask a question about the characterist of the econometr model that we   ve been talk about   imagin a simul in which there is ongo deflat   i   ll just pick a number of    percent a year for the sake of argument here   and expect have fulli adjust and peopl are anticip ongo deflat of    percent   now imagin anoth case of the same sort with   percent deflat or    percent or    percent where expect are fulli adjust   in the mean   all govern interest rate have settl at zero on all matur   as i understand it  the characterist of the model are such that it will generat a higher amount of unemploy the greater the rate of deflat  and monetari quantiti don   t enter into this calcul at all   so  that   s a characterist of the model   and the simul that we have talk about that were in the paper you present embodi that characterist where expect  are consist with the deflat that will be generat by the way the model work   but  of cours  that is an experi that we have not in fact had  suppos you were to generat a simul with a differ assumpt  such as that ani deflat that got under way would not last beyond five year and that after five year expect inflat would be zero   that would result in veri differ dynam  i think  at least as it  appli to the behavior of long term invest becaus it would mean that veri long term interest rate would not in fact be driven high in real term as a consequ of just a short period of deflat   so the issu has to do in part with the characterist of the model and in part with the assumpt under which the model is simul to give these result   i see peopl shake their head in agreement  so i guess i   m on the right track there   now  you say that the model assumpt is that quantiti are not too import   that of cours reflect the fact that if  you had a simul with  say    percent deflat a year for mani year  it turn out with a fix monetari base  for exampl  to generat an enorm increas in the monetari base per capita  and you   re say that it would not matter   of cours  this argument was explor quit  thorough back in the     s and     s with all the discuss about keynesian unemploy equilibrium and real balanc effect   that was sort of the origin of patinkin   s book  on which i cut my teeth as a graduat student   your model assum that those quantit effect can   t work or are not oper   i just want to be clear about the natur of the experi that we   re run   sure  in term of u s  experi  you would not be abl to es  paramet about the expect process to distinguish between an assumpt of continu deflat and an assumpt that  whatev might happen in the mean   zero inflat is expect after five year   that   s not within the realm of experi   so you couldn   t realli come up with ani es  to distinguish one assumpt versus the other assumpt becaus it   s not in the data set  therefor  the characterist in the model that you use  particular this full ration expect equilibrium  are critic to the output that you get   i   d like to make just one other comment about that  and i think marvin was get at this point   as a practic matter  if we ever fell into an ongo deflat   and certain the u s  experi in the     s illustr this veri well   all sort of other thing would happen in term of the reaction of the govern   if we think about what has happen in argentina  the way i read it is that essenti the convers of all dollar magnitud to peso destroy ani possibl of a capit market in dollar becaus ani contract made in dollar can be undon by the govern at ani  e  that   s the experi that countri has just gone through   so interest rate polici is irrelev as well becaus there is no secur in contract go forward   anyth can be undon at ani  e   consequ  argentina is in a terribl mess becaus it has destroy the possibl for a normal function of it monetari economi with normal function credit market
the veri definit of an interest rate presuppos properti right
exact   one has to be abl to count on contract be fulfil on both side of the transact  and that assur is gone in argentina   now  as a practic matter  in extrem circumst someth along those line also would begin to happen in the unit state   in fact  someth of that sort did start to happen with cartel in the     s  where normal commerci activ found themselv be conduct under a new set of rule   rule in which there was not veri much confid becaus they could be undon at almost ani  e  to me that   s the more import lesson of our experi as to what happen if a countri end up in a period of depress   that a lot of the normal commerci activ begin to be question as a consequ of other activ that might take place   the reason i want to emphas that point is that the characterist of the model and the assumpt in the model are obvious critic to the simul exercis that were run   and given that i would put a lot more weight on quantit effect  if you will  that are not in the model at all  i regard the model as be of limit   not zero  but limit    relev on the issu of what the appropri long run inflat target ought to be   i   m not convinc  given the assumpt and the way in which the model is simul  that the result tell us veri much about the question of what rate of inflat would be most appropri or most stabl
i   d like to respond to a coupl of comment you made regard how the model was simul  just so i can clarifi a few point
i was rais question more than make assert
with regard to the assumpt of ration expect  what we did in the paper and in what we report today was to assum ration expect  mean that the expect peopl form are those of the model   we also assum that fiscal polici come in aggress after five year to stop a    great depress    from occur or at least to limit the damag   one of the implic of that is that after five year the zero bound is not constrain polici anymor   basic  fiscal polici is replac monetari polici  that   s the way we think of it   so in your exampl  you could think of the zero bound in play for five year  affect the five year bond complet   but the ten year bond would have five year for which it wasn   t affect  and the thirti year bond obvious would be affect even less   so the way we did this  when we bring in the fiscal polici i think that is closer to what you consid a more reason way of think about this   that it would onli be go on for about five year
what happen to the inflat rate five year out
the expect are still ration in the sens that  if we had deflat for five year  say  the inflat rate would start come back to zero gradual depend on the quantiti dynam   it wouldn   t jump to zero  but it would come back gradual
so a ten year bond would be price in a deflat rate of   percent five year out  but it would also be price in an inflat rate that would be back to zero ten year out
right  and that would depend on whatev your target was   so with regard to what happen in the    great depress    scenario  it   s clear that our frb us model break down under condit such as a    percent unemploy rate   again  with fiscal polici come in  the rescu packag avoid these situat general   our analysi has few of those event occur and  one could say     contamin    our result   in our paper i believ we report that with a zero inflat target  we would have a major depress onc everi centuri or so   so i think that address those two question  on the quantiti effect  it   s true that what we are say is that if quantiti effect don   t matter   the monetari base  sn   t matter   this is what the problem would be   clear  if one were to layer on the effect that marvin was talk about  that could lessen or chang the result we would get   i would note that at the vermont woodstock confer  ben mccallum look at the question of how big the quantiti effect would be  and his conclus was that normal they wouldn   t be that big   but that   s a point that i think one might disput
may i ask one other question about invest behavior in the model under these circumst   i rememb  and you may  too  if you ever read the macro textbook written by martin bailey of the univers of chicago   not the martin n  baili who was recent on the cea   a veri strike chapter in which he was tri to address this issu of unemploy equilibrium in a keynesian context   what he point out was that  if you have invest project  a finit amount of capit spend can produc return into the indefinit futur   the exampl he use were land improv   my favorit one  which alway made me smile  was level the midwest    laughter   the midwest is not perfect level and in fact there are drainag problem in all the agricultur area in the midwest   at ani rate  bailey had these fun applic   in this case he said that you could strip off the topsoil  bring earth up from the shallow part of the gulf of mexico  use it to fill in various area  and level the midwest   then  onc you had creat this level agricultur land at some finit cost   it would be expens but the cost would be finit   you would have an indefinit stream of higher product from the improv land   and  as you push the interest rate down to zero  the valu of that indefinit stream becom as larg as you   d like and cover ani finit cost of do the project   so he argu that the notion that the invest demand function hit the axi at a zero rate of interest  sn   t make ani sens   critic to that argument  of cours  is the exist of properti right becaus the argument  sn   t work if in fact you can   t realiz the return   if they are cut off as a consequ of seizur of land or whatev  japan  of cours  has not push long term interest rate down to zero  which would be within the realm of possibl for the central bank to do   presum the bank of japan could push out the matur structur   so one of the question i would put to you is  what are the characterist of the invest demand function that you   ve been work with   if we push long term interest rate down to zero  or as close to zero as we pleas  we can make those present valu for indefinit stream of incom as larg as we pleas   now  of cours  there   s the question about risk premium  or a lack of secur  and i understand that
that   s whi that never actual occur in a simul   while you could be drive down expect long run rate on a riskless secur close to zero  for privat invest these endogen risk premium are go up becaus the health of the economi is not good in that state of the world   so i think in principl  if you could somehow get rid of that risk  you could mitig these slump by quit a bit in that world   but what exacerb those slump in the world that we   re simul here is that the risk premium on privat asset   the default premium   are rise   and that   s not a small effect  actual
right   although let   s look at the japanes case   clear  if japan had move earlier and more aggress to drive long term govern rate down to zero  that would have produc  at least in the short run   becaus all those risk premium were alreadi there   a declin of the privat rate as well  presum basi point for basi point
it might even have been more than one for one becaus the expect default risk might have been drop under those condit
thank you  mr  chairman   i also find it interest to go through this kind of exercis  academ as it is  in part becaus it help to get one think about what we can learn from our own histor experi and that of other countri   we also learn someth about what the literatur has had to say about these kind of issu over  e   what other peopl have said in past  e might be relev in the futur  even though it hasn   t been relev over the most inflationari period of the last sever decad   like bill    i don   t think we can learn a lot from the experi of japan in the     s that would help us becaus the start point is so differ   to me the start point for the japanes experi        was more compar to the situat in which the british found themselv in the     s than the problem our countri experienc in the     s   japan start off with the price of cantaloup at about     and the land under the imperi palac worth more than the state of california   or so it was said   and constrain itself on the exchang rate regim   in that environ  if you   re go to liber your economi  either you   re go to have fall good and asset price    what we call deflat   or you   re go to have a fall exchang rate   if you say    no    to the fall exchang rate and also say that you are go to tri to prevent the deflat in good and asset price   futil as it may be   then the notion of have quantit eas or an interest rate polici in that set isn   t go to take you anywher   someth has to give  and it may give violent  last year  when japan announc quantit eas  there was a veri interest piec by    wood say that  yes  it was a move in the right direct but it wasn   t near enough   he had some es   and i   ve forgotten what they were  as to how much japan would have to do for the polici to be effect   by the end of the year the amount probabl got to the order of magnitud that he was suggest last march when the japanes introduc this program   but he also was veri clear about the implic for the exchang rate of pursu that kind of polici  a problem with a deflat   we talk about disinfl mean that the real rate rise relat to nomin rate   is that deflat mean  as i look at it  that we get into an asymmetri where the real rate is abov the nomin rate   and if you have a zero bound nomin rate and you acceler deflat and build in expect of fall price  that result in a situat where the more you drive polici in that direct  the more you have the real rate rise   so you have a self reinforc contractionari mechan unless you can somehow turn that around  this is just the invers of parkin   s paradox  where in an environ of acceler inflat with peopl adjust their behavior  the quantiti demand of nomin balanc is go to fall  so a lower monetari growth is expansionari   the invers is that  if peopl are expect a sustain disinflationari process  then the quantiti of demand money rise and so a fa  money growth is consist with a disinflationari model   therefor  it   s call a paradox   the same thing  i think  appli to deflat   it say that you have to have much  much greater increas in the quantiti of money   you have to engag in quantit eas   to get out of that  one of the writer on this  go back sever decad  was axel leijonhufvud  when he was work with clower at northwe n   he said that the problem the general theori was address is that even a market economi that normal is inher stabl within a corridor can be blown out of this corridor of stabil   into an inflationari spiral or a deflationari spiral   by various type of shock   then he brought in what he call a more general theori keynesian type polici   also import is that the distinct between what we would call monetari polici or fiscal polici wasn   t veri use becaus the mechan by which central bank money is creat was no longer there   we saw this in some real life case in germani   this goe to marvin   s point about how the central bank get base money into the system or take it back out  germani had a situat in         and thereaft   when all the exchang regim were come apart   where they had a massiv inflow of foreign own deposit into their system   they also had what they consid to be a veri expansionari monetari polici  and they didn   t know how to contain it   they could go onli so far with reserv requir and so on   so what they introduc was a special stabil surcharg where they ad a surtax on person and corpor incom tax to constrain demand   i ask     well  how   it work      they answer that they put the balanc at the central bank and just build that up by as much as the amount of the surtax   and i said     oh  that   s monetari polici  which contract the base      and they said     no  it   s fiscal polici      they said that in the polit dialogu it was import to call it fiscal polici   okay  that   s fine with me   well  they also had sold all their govern secur  again a problem that marvin rais   and then they ask     now what do we do      i said that it was simpl   they should just issu money market liabil on the central bank   and  they said     how much      and i said     as much as it take  just offer a posit rate of interest and sell them and you can contract base money     as a part of a pedagog exercis  sinc this is an academ discuss  i did it the other way around   how would you as a central bank expand the monetari base if you didn   t have the opportun to go out and buy govern secur or someth like that   my answer is that you should simpli run a posit sum lotteri   there   s no question that you could sell an aw lot of ticket  laughter  if you have a posit sum lotteri offer to credit the winner   s account  you can blow up the monetari base as much as you want  and you can  il it as much as you want
ani more comment  gentlemen   presid broaddus
i had a veri narrow follow up question to the origin question that i believ you rais  mr  chairman  about discontinu   i would address it to marvin   i thought i had ask him everyth i need to ask  but i guess i haven   t   the key element that work in marvin   s mechan is the broad liquid premium and yield and the abil to move that   so my question is this   is it necessarili the case that the mechan can   t work increment at the zero bound   in other word  becaus of the natur of the mechan that is at work  it seem to me that we can   t rule out the possibl that we wouldn   t have to pump in a lot of money and then run the risk of a big resurg in inflat   is that right
yes  i think that   s true   if this polici were known to be effect and all the piec were in place to make it work  it   s probabl true that you could get by with a much smaller increas in the monetari base   that   s becaus onc peopl saw that it was go to work  they would be more op ist about the futur   as with all these model  credibl is everyth   if the polici is realli credibl  asset price would begin to rise  and then the economi would start to recov   i think that would be true
presid  n
i have a coupl of comment by way of express some reserv or uncertainti   when i first look at marvin   s work  i was reassur   it seem as if there was a long list of option we might tri and sort of roll on our own   but quantit i don   t know the signific of ani of this  and i don   t know if there are ani es  around   i suppos not  given the circumst   so i guess i   m less reassur than i was earlier  howev  my major point is that the other paper seem to suggest that one way to avoid troubl is not to set the inflat target too low   of cours  if we phrase it that way  that make good sens   but if i think about it a littl more intuit  i   m not quit sure i buy that   there is respect literatur that say op  polici should aim for low interest rate and low inflat  i admit that  at least in my world  the economi is larg self correct   i also agre with the  comment that we can   t learn much from look at japan   and what i think we can learn from look at the major depress in our own countri is that a seri of polici mistak were made  and if we avoid those mistak  we   re like to avoid those kind of problem again  my final observ along those line  and i wouldn   t push this too far  is that if we look at the perform of the u s  economi in the second half of the nineteenth centuri  at least superfici  we see a mild deflat accompani by fair steadi increas in per capita gdp  that suggest that overal the economi could oper in that kind of environ   i think i   ll let  it go at that
okay   whi don   t we take a coffe break and then we   ll turn to the chart show   coffe break
we will now have the chart show present by      larri    and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   we will be refer to the materi label    staff present on the econom outlook     your first chart sketch the broad outlin of the staff project   as you know from the  book  we believ    materi use by mr     mr     and ms   son are append to this document  appendix      that econom activ is close to or at a trough   if this inde turn out to be the case  we will have experienc a veri mild contract in some dimens   for exampl  as shown in the upper left panel  we now expect that four quarter growth in real gdp may just touch zero rather than dip well below  as has been more typic of postwar recess   as shown in the panel to the right  our  book project had output edg onli slight lower last quarter   a consider better outcom than we had been expect just six week ago   moreov  as larri will be discuss in a few minut  the data on manufactur    order  shipment  and inventori that we receiv this morn were a shade stronger than we had been expect and  all els equal  would caus us to nudg up a shade further our es  of growth last quarter and this quarter   i should note  of cours  that bea   s ad up of the fourth quarter will be releas tomorrow morn   we see real gdp growth gather steam over the first half of this year  move modest abov the growth of potenti by the third quarter and remain abov potenti through the end of next year   as shown in the middl left panel  we expect the unemploy rate to peak soon at onli a littl abov it current level and then to drift down over the remaind of the forecast period  slack in resourc util  togeth with the indirect effect of lower energi price  should be suffici to put core pce price inflat   shown by the red line in the middl right panel   on a downward trajectori   and with structur product growth expect to rebound a bit next year  we see core pce inflat move down into the neighborhood of   percent by the end of        the bottom panel outlin some of the major forc shape the outlook as we see it   first  on our assumpt  monetari and fiscal s ulus will be substanti enough to offset consider restraint from the stock market and the dollar   second  the inventori correct should be come to an end   third  excess capac in mani industri is like to weigh on the strength of the recoveri in equip spend   final  inflationari pressur remain in check   your next chart provid some histor perspect on the recess that we believ is just conclud   as you may know  the busi cycl date committe of the nation bureau of econom research appli three criteria in determin whether a given histor episod qualifi as a recess  these criteria are often refer to as    the three ds    of recess   durat  depth  and dispers   to qualifi as a bona fide recess  a slowdown in activ must last long enough  involv a larg enough contract of activ  and affect a broad enough swath of the economi   the top panel of this chart measur recess in term of the first    d     durat  if the staff forecast were to come true in everi respect  we are guess that the busi cycl date committe would eventu declar the trough in activ as have occur either this month or next  put this recess right at the postwar averag in term of it durat   the middl panel turn to the second    d    and present various measur of the  depth of postwar recess   as shown on line    if measur by the absolut declin in real gdp from it own peak to it own trough  this has been a veri mild recess   involv a reduct of onli     percent  rough a fifth of the postwar averag and the mildest of the bunch   an import featur of this episod  though  was that the offici period of recess   as defin by the nber   was preced by a period of subpar growth   so if one defin depth on the basi of the chang in the gdp gap from it own peak to it own trough  then   as shown on line     the current recess bulk a bit larger relat to the postwar averag   similar  if one measur sever accord to the increas in the unemploy rate  line    the recess just end was again about two third as sever as the averag   final  as shown on line    if industri product is the metric of choic  then the current episod clock in at a three quarter rate relat to the postwar averag   these comparison highlight  that everi recess is differ   in this episod  the declin in real gdp was quit mild compar with the histor averag  wherea the declin in ip was onli a bit less than the averag   turn to the final    d     the bottom panel present one measur of dispers    that is  how broad the slowdown has been felt   this panel show the bls   s three month diffus index for privat nonfarm payrol employ   for this seri   which is base on employ chang in     differ industri  read below    signifi that more industri report a declin in payrol employ over the preced three month than an increas   the latest few read on this seri suggest that the recent slowdown has been about as broad felt as the prior three recess for which this seri is avail   the next two chart review our assumpt about four key condit variabl in the staff project   chart   focus first on the real feder fund rate  defin here as the nomin rate less the four quarter rate of chang in the core pce price index   as shown in the top panel  the committe   s action over the past year have brought this measur of the real fund rate down almost to zero  a low level by histor standard but not unpreced   the middl left panel take a differ approach to compar the current cyclic experi to previous episod   in this panel  the black line show the trajectori of the real fund rate for the eight quarter preced the peak  to the left of the vertic line  and the eight quarter follow the peak  to the right of the vertic line    for this purpos  we treat the first quarter of      as the peak quarter  in line with the nber peg march as the peak month   the red line show the averag path of the fund rate in the nine earlier postwar recess   final  the blue region show the entir extent of the rang of valu taken on by the real fund rate dure each of the nine earlier episod   sever featur of this panel are notabl   first  relat to earlier episod  the real fund rate come into the peak this  e around was on a shallow upward trajectori   presum reflect that inflat was under far better control toward the end of the most recent busi cycl expans than in the averag previous episod   second  and perhap more import for determin the contour of the recoveri  the real fund rate turn down earlier and more decis and is project to remain lower throughout the project period than was the case in the averag previous experi   inde  a central drive forc in the staff outlook is the s ulus provid by monetari polici   the remain two panel on this chart turn to anoth major sourc of s ulus  name fiscal polici   as you know from the  book  we abandon the partial expens provis and the second round of person incom tax rebat that we had built into the decemb project   howev  as indic in the middl right panel  we still anticip that the feder budget will provid a consider boost to activ this year  even without those provis   a good chunk of the anticip impetus reflect the next instal on the phase in tax cut that were enact last year   but the greater amount of the overal impetus will come  we expect  on the spend side of the budget   most of it alreadi enact  but we also have a small placehold in the project for some addit appropri this year   as shown in the bottom  panel  the impetus that we are expect this year   a bit more than   percent of gdp   is on a par with the level of      and      and a consider turnaround from the late     s and earli to mid     s when fiscal polici was restrict   your next chart turn first to the behavior of the dollar   as shown in the top panel  we have the real exchang valu of the dollar hang up near it current level throughout the remaind of the forecast period   a glanc at the histori of this seri suggest that there realli is no    typic    behavior of the exchang rate around a busi cycl turn point   in two of the nber recess sinc the breakdown of the bretton wood agreement in the earli     s  the dollar tend toward appreci  while in the other two it trend down   as shown in the middl left panel  compar with the averag of these veri differ experi  the dollar in the current episod was on a steeper upward trajectori befor the peak and has remain relat strong despit the committe   s aggress move toward an easier stanc of monetari polici   in a similar vein  the middl right panel suggest that the stock market  which had import fuel demand until       has been a restrain forc around the most recent busi cycl peak relat to the averag histor experi and on our assumpt will remain so through next year   as shown by the black line in this panel  the market   repres here by the s p    price index   declin sharpli come into the peak and lost anoth    percent in the two quarter after the peak  end the third quarter of last year down a total of about    percent from it high  part of that loss was recov in the rebound dure the fourth quarter  but even so  we believ that some addit restraint on consum and busi spend is probabl still in the pipelin   as you can see from the dash portion of the black line in the middl right panel  we have assum onli a mild uptrend in equiti price over the forecast period   we view our assumpt about the stock market as a relat neutral one  but we are awar that tradit measur   such as the price earn ratio shown in the bottom panel   continu to suggest that equiti valuat are rich by histor standard   on balanc  as is illustr in your next chart  our assumpt for these condit variabl and other consider lead us to expect a milder than   averag recoveri   as shown on line   in the top panel  we expect real gdp to grow a bit more than   percent over the four quarter begin in the current quarter    rough half the averag rate of increas over compar period in postwar recoveri   with potenti gdp expect to grow about     percent over the next four quarter  the project recoveri would close about    percentag point of the gap  line    that we believ current exist between actual and potenti gdp   reflect the relat tepid pace of the recoveri  we expect the unemploy rate  line    to be about unchang over this period rather than declin a littl more than   percentag point  as has been the histor averag   moreov  we expect the industri sector to be veri slow in rebound  with growth over the next four quarter of onli    percent   far slower than the doubl digit postwar averag   at least in one respect  the milder than averag project recoveri is not to be lament  as shown in the middl panel  we believ there is consider less slack in the economi current than has typic been the case at trough sinc      and thus  in one sens  not enough room for a cyclic    normal    rebound   the bottom panel attempt to shed some light on the question of where the slower than averag recoveri show up   these panel show contribut to gdp growth over the next four quarter from key compon of aggreg demand  with some interest sensit element of household spend on the left and the busi sector repres on the right   turn first to the household sector  we have residenti invest and durabl good spend contribut less than   percentag point to the growth of gdp over the next four quarter  wherea in previous recess they have general contribut consider more than that   the seem lacklust perform of these compon of spend this  e around is the flip side of their have held up remark well through the contract phase of the cycl and thus should not be expect to move up by the averag amount from their current level   on the busi side  the ongo tribul of the communic and aircraft sector have help shape our judgment   reflect in the lower right panel   that busi fix invest will add less than   percentag point to overal gdp growth over the next four quarter  wherea in mani previous expans bfi has made a posit contribut of more than    point   larri   will now continu our present
let me turn now from the broad contour of our project to  some of the detail   chart   show a few of the high frequenc product indic that have influenc our judgment about the current state of the economi   one import indic that has inform our think is privat payrol employ  the upper left panel    as you can see  the rate of declin began to slow at the end of last year   more recent  initi claim for unemploy insur   shown to the right   have continu to fall  on balanc  and are now reach a level that typic is consist with stabl employ   in term of product itself  assembl of motor vehicl  the middl left panel  have been move in a sawtooth pattern dure the past few month but at a fair high level on averag   and as shown by the dash line  automak plan to maintain output at close to the recent pace   howev  elsewher in manufactur   the middl right panel   we es  that product continu to contract at a substanti pace through decemb   even here  though  the veri recent news is promis   for one thing  an index of select week physic product data  exclud motor vehicl and electr generat  which is construct by the staff  appear to have stabil dure januari  the week index is illustr in the black line of the lower left panel  while the bar show the month averag   although this index repres onli about   percent of industri product  the fact that it seem to have stabil is certain a good sign  moreov  the ism   former known as the napm   new order diffus index turn up sharpli in novemb and decemb   base on histor relationship  these increas  if maintain  suggest that the contract in the ip sub compon shown in the panel abov should come to an end in the not too distant futur   turn from product to sale  the tabl at the top of chart   show some key near term indic of privat domest final purchas   by now  the stori for sale of motor vehicl   line   of the tabl   is quit familiar   the onli point i would make is that  even with the phase down of the zero percent financ incent  sale are still relat buoyant   more broad  real consum spend for good other than motor vehicl  line    rebound in octob from a depress septemb read  and sizabl gain were maintain in novemb and decemb   moreov  for what it   s worth  the week read on chain store sale  not shown  suggest that spend held up reason well in the first four week of januari   activ in the hous sector   line     also has held up quit well   the outlook for busi invest  howev  is more mix   i   ll talk about the inform technolog sector in a few moment   let me note here that outsid of it  shipment of nondefens capit good   line     have yet to show a sustain pickup   but the order data we receiv this morn   line   of the tabl   were encourag and could contain the first hint of a turnaround in this sector   the near term path for product is be influenc import by the dynam of the inventori cycl   the middl two panel show measur of the day    suppli of inventori   these measur are base on a system that use industri product and other indic to trace the flow of good and materi through the economi   the left panel show the huge overhang of semiconductor and other item relat to the it sector that develop dure late      and the first part of       while sever overhang still plagu produc of communic equip  stock of semiconductor and comput have been brought down to more manag level  and the day    suppli for the entir sector has retrac a good part of it earlier run up   outsid the it sector  the right panel   progress has been more uneven  and inventori in sever industri   notabl  paper  electr machineri  furnitur and apparel   remain excess   accord  we expect product in mani of these industri to remain subdu a while longer   the bottom panel show how we see the near term inventori dynam play out   the solid black line show the level of gdp exclud motor vehicl  while the dash line show final sale exclud motor vehicl   when the level of gdp exceed the level of final sale  the gap is shade   and reflect the extent of inventori accumul   similar  the red shade area is a period when product is below sale and inventori are be liquid   in our project  the maximum amount of non motor vehicl liquid is es  to have occur in the fourth quarter of        we expect the pace of liquid to diminish over the next coupl of quarter as busi boost the level of product up to the level of final sale  provid a consider fillip to near term gdp growth   the next exhibit focus on the outlook for two key compon of gdp    busi and household spend   as shown on line   of the tabl  the prime mover of busi invest this year in our forecast is a reviv in spend for comput and peripher  which we think is alreadi under way   inde  with the growth of real comput shipment surg well into posit territori late   the right panel   we es  that invest outlay increas at an annual rate of    percent in the fourth quarter of        the question  of cours  is whether this is just a short live burst or the start of a sustain upsw   the anecdot report have been increas favor  with stori of a pickup in the demand for high end server near the end of last year and the likelihood of an    upgrad cycl    for pcs begin dure        in term of hard data  one encourag indic is the seri from our ip system on product of semiconductor  the middl left panel   which we have found to be use in predict comput invest for up to two quarter ahead   as you can see  this seri has record solid gain in recent month   as firm step up the pace of spend for new comput  we expect that they will want to upgrad their softwar as well   line   of the tabl   in contrast to comput and softwar  the outlook for communic equip   line     remain negat   both our near term indic  such as product and new order  and the anecdot inform suggest that a substanti capit overhang is still weigh heavili on this segment of the market   at best  we don   t expect the situat to stabil until some  this summer   busi spend for other equip  line    is also project to be quit soft   a sizabl portion of the spend for this categori  which includ such thing as metalwork and industri machineri  come from manufactur firm   but as shown in the middl right  manufactur capac util current is quit low  and it stay relat low throughout the project period  provid littl incent for mani manufactur to boost spend on new equip   the lower panel examin our consumpt forecast   in light of the robust perform of pce last year  especi given the rise in unemploy and the slump in the stock market  one might be tempt to ask whether our wealth effect stori has been fail us   one crude way to answer the question is to compar the behavior of the wealth incom ratio  the black line in the left panel  with the ratio of  pce to incom  essenti   minus the save rate  which is shown by the red line  as you can see  over  e these two seri track each other fair well  and they have  been well align recent   moreov  our more elabor econometr model of consumpt that includ wealth have not been make persist error   one reason that consumpt growth has been as strong as it has is that real incom growth   the yellow bar in the lower right panel   also has been relat well maintain  look forward  consumpt spend is held up in part by the strong growth of real dispos incom that we expect in       with a chunk of that gain come from  the cut in tax rate that went into effect on januari     the upper left panel of chart   show our project for core pce price inflat  as   point out earlier  we expect core pce inflat to slow by    percentag point over the next two year   the project deceler of core inflat reflect  in part  the indirect effect of declin energi price   as shown in the middl right panel  accord to staff es   energi input price face by nonfinanci corpor other than energi produc have revers all of their      spurt  drop rapid sinc earli        of cours  chang in energi input price are not necessarili fulli  nor immedi  pass through to final purchas   but over the next year  we expect lower energi input cost to reduc the rate of core inflat about     percentag point   essenti offset last year   s boost   anoth import factor lead to a deceler of inflat over the next two year is the low rate of resourc util that we anticip   as shown in the middl left panel  we expect actual gdp to be below the es  level of potenti gdp throughout the project period  albeit with the gap narrow somewhat  and  as   mention earlier  the unemploy rate remain in the vicin of   percent   the slack in labor market is like to be a damp influenc on the growth rate of unit labor cost over the project period judg relat to either actual product  as illustr by the bar in the middl right panel  or structur product  the line   that said  the bottom panel highlight one upsid risk to the inflat forecast  which we discuss in the altern simul section of the  book   name  extrem narrow profit margin   as you can see  the profit share drop sharpli between      and       and we expect it to remain low   in part  this reflect strong competit pressur from price of import good   howev  histor experi suggest that the profit share won   t stay this low forev   thus  we face the risk that over the next two year firm may begin increas price in an attempt to rebuild profit margin     will now continu our present
the staff   s outlook for econom activ in the rest of the world is for a rebound to moder growth this year  which strengthen somewhat next year  although we alreadi see tentat sign of posit develop in mani region  the project recoveri depend import on the project acceler in u s  real gdp just discuss by   and larri   the global economi   contain weak spot  notabl japan and argentina  where econom develop could be dramat wors than in our baselin dure the forecast period   i will discuss the problem in those countri short   howev  our judgment is that those risk are unlik to have a major effect on the u s  economi dure the forecast period   your first intern chart report recent develop in financi market  the foreign exchang valu of the dollar  shown in the top left panel  has risen further over the past sever month   the staff index of major currenc   the black line    has been touch sixteen year high in recent day   the dollar is now signific stronger against the yen   the red line   than at the  e of your last chart show  amid more news that the japanes economi continu to falter and ongo public exchang about offici view on the yen dollar exchang rate   the dollar has recent move up against the euro but is still below the latest peak reach at mid         the panel at the right contain futur quot on three month interest rate for this year and next taken from eurocurr market   these curv reflect market expect that dollar interest rate will rise more sharpli over the forecast period than will euro rate  in line with general anticip of a relat stronger rebound in u s  real output growth   as is evid from the middl panel  both dollar and euro short term market interest rate have fallen over the past six month  but the declin in euro rate is mark less than that in dollar rate   this reflect the more aggress eas of polici done by the committe relat to that done by the ecb  the net chang in both u s  and german long term rate over the same interv have been quit limit  and those rate have move in similar way for some  e   in contrast  japanes short term rate have remain essenti at zero  and japanes long term rate are still low but are up veri slight from mid        stock price in all three region  shown at the bottom left  have move down on balanc sinc last june   u s  and european stock price have track close  wherea japanes stock price have move down to near record low for the period sinc the bubbl of the late     s   at the right are analyst    expect earn from i b e s for the s p     compani and from morgan stanley   s euro area index   as you can see  those earn have been steadili revis down sinc mid       with the european declin exceed that for the s p   in your next chart the top panel show trade data by region  with the averag for octob and novemb repres by the dot   note that the scale are equival but shift  import by region uniform exceed export by region   as a consequ of the slowdown in activ  both here and abroad  export and import actual declin dure        decreas in export came earliest in canada and latest in europ  reflect the onset and extent of slowdown in those region   export to develop asia fell sharpli  as those economi were particular hard hit by the global collaps in the high tech sector   the declin in import primarili reflect develop in the u s  economi   sign in the most recent data of an increas in our import from  develop asia suggest that a turnaround may have start in semiconductor and high tech more broad   our outlook for the price of oil is present in the middl left panel   the spot price for west texa intermedi has fallen signific sinc the june chart show and more than the futur market at that  e   and our forecast   had expect  this retrac of much of the earlier run up in oil price is a major factor support our view that output will acceler over the forecast period in most region of the global economi   embed in our forecast is the project that oil price will move up onli slight from current level  as now anticip by the futur market   the price of import good other than oil  comput  and semiconductor   term core good   are shown to the right   those price dip dure the first three quarter of       as good price fell broad  particular price of industri suppli   go forward  as price of industri suppli ceas fall  the index for core good price should stabil and then rise at a low rate   the bottom panel show the analysi behind our outlook for a return to moder growth in export and to more vigor expans of import   core export   the red bar on the left   should recov from a sharp declin last year  we expect them to be flat this year and then to grow more than   percent next year   the blue bar repres the portion of core export growth attribut to foreign gdp growth  and the yellow bar captur an addit cyclic effect from growth that improv forecast accuraci in our model   togeth  these variabl onli part explain the weak of export in        go forward  they account for much of the acceler we are expect   the lag effect of the strong dollar  reflect in the   bar that measur the contribut of relat price  act as a drag on export throughout the interv   becaus we expect that some of the unexplain weak in      will be  revers this year and next  our judgment forecast call for export to recov a bit more than the sum of the foreign growth and relat price would predict   a similar breakdown is shown for import of core good   in       core import declin despit flat u s  gdp and dollar strength that would be expect to impart a posit impetus to import   over the forecast period  core import growth should recov strong  with u s  gdp account for about half that growth this year and more next year   lag effect of the strong dollar boost import in       but much less so in      as our forecast call for the dollar to stabil at it current elev level   as with export  our judgment forecast is a bit stronger than the model output   the panel on the right show the arithmet contribut of import and export of total good and servic to u s  gdp growth   in       the declin in export subtract from output growth while that in import contribut posit   for this year and next  we expect to see the more normal posit contribut from export as they rise through        the negat contribut of import is expect to be consist larger in magnitud dure both year   the outlook for the global economi that lie behind our project for export is report on your follow chart   the top left panel compar real gdp growth in the unit state with averag growth in the rest of the world  the unit state essenti led the world slowdown in       and it is the project recoveri in u s  growth that lie behind much of the rebound shown for foreign growth   both this year and next  we expect that u s  growth will exceed the averag of our trade partner   the panel to the right show that the swing from declin this year to growth next year is expect to be largest for the asian develop countri   our baselin forecast is for a more mute recoveri on averag in latin america and in the industri countri   recent product data for canada  germani  and japan are shown in the middl left   the downshift of product in japan is clear evid  some retrench also occur in canada and germani  with industri product and gdp contract dure        the panel at the right contain our forecast for real gdp growth over the forecast period for the industri countri   we look for posit but low growth in the euro area earli in      and then an acceler of output later this year and next   the pattern is similar for canada and the unit kingdom  but growth is judg to be stronger in the near term for both these countri and to acceler to higher growth rate in canada  larg as a consequ of it close tie to the u s  economi   japan is the except   with current indic suggest further deterior for some   e  we have output declin further dure this year  stabil toward the end of the year  and then grow weak in        mani of the emerg market economi of asia  the subject of the bottom  panel  depend heavili on export of high tech good to support the strong pace of econom expans they record dure      and earli        as can be seen from  the exampl of singapor  export for these countri drop sharpli start in late       and real output contract dure        even in korea  where the economi is larger and more diversifi than in most other asian economi  the fall in export was a major factor in the downturn last year   mainland china experienc a paus in the rapid export growth that had been occur  howev  expand domest spend  includ govern expenditur  sustain output growth around   percent despit the slowdown in the global economi   look forward  we see a rebound in activ in the region as the high tech sector resum grow and as export demand recov more broad   your next chart highlight the problem current confront japan and the scope for macroeconom polici to address those problem   as is evid in the red bar in the top left panel  the temporari buoyanc in real gdp in      gave way to contract in        the contribut of domest demand  shown by the blue bar  had been the sourc of strength in       privat invest in the high tech sector was a major part of that strength   the global bust in high tech and some overhang of capit in that sector and more general becam a sourc of contract for output in       with corpor profit slide and unemploy on the rise  we see even lower invest and person consumpt this year  but we expect that by      domest demand will expand enough to support low but posit growth with a small boost from net export   along with the deepen of the output gap this year and next  we expect that deflat of consum price  shown to the right  will continu throughout the forecast period   the middl panel provid a snapshot of the scope for macroeconom polici to address the deflationari trap ensnar the economi   money market interest rate are wide expect to remain at zero   the debat over monetari polici has shift to the bank of japan   s option for provid more liquid   over the past year  the boj has step up it target rang for current balanc held on it book by financi institut and other   from total of   trillion to   trillion yen dure much of       the boj has move to maintain these deposit at around    trillion yen   what remain unclear is the extent to which this addit liquid  by itself  will s ul aggreg demand   fiscal polici  shown to the right  confront the problem of past high debt issuanc and unfavor demograph develop that are now close at hand   as

rebound to moder growth in mexico by the second half of this year and some strengthen of activ in brazil   the situat in argentina is fraught with enorm risk for that countri  as well as the possibl that we may yet see more contagion effect elsewher in latin america than have been evid so far   the panel at the right indic the scope of econom problem that need to be address within argentina  in addit to the resolut of it intern debt oblig   these problem are sever and pose a challeng to the polit stabil and institut of argentina   with respect to fiscal matter  thorough reform of the tax

other excess of the past   the tension rais by these econom problem threaten to overwhelm the polit system   we recogn this risk but have not tri to quantifi it in ani way   the bottom panel present some addit detail from the simul report in the  book in which contagion effect from the current situat in argentina are greater than we incorpor in the baselin   in this altern  the risk premium associ with the currenc of mexico  brazil  chile  and venezuela are assum to rise sharpli  put downward pressur on their respect exchang rate   in addit  this financi stress is assum to depress domest

possibl scenario of what contagion from the argentin crisi might entail in the  event the current benign situat prove to be too good to last     will now complet our present
your last chart display the project that you submit for this year   the central tendenc of your project for the growth of real gdp is revis down from the june meet   likewis  the central tendenc of pce inflat project is revis down a notch from last year   we would now be pleas to address your question
that was an excel summari   well done   governor
i have a coupl of question   on chart    is the semiconductor product chart normal for advanc in comput capac
yes   this is our industri product index  which is actual construct by look at product on a chip by chip basi   at that level of detail   so by do that we are account for chang in qualiti over  e
okay   what expect do you have for real price with respect to semiconductor   presum that   s a key part of your product outlook
well  there are two thing go on   one  in the veri short term d ram price actual have shot way up  as you know  appar becaus of demand   but over the longer haul  we expect a return   becaus of technolog improv   to the rapid rate of declin that we saw over the cours of the     s  which would be on the order of    to    percent
if i may ask one more question  mr  chairman   the nber busi cycl date committe  when they announc their call that we are in recess  put in an unusu sentenc with respect to septemb    suggest that they might not have made the call had the terrorist attack not occur     the staff have a perspect about what the data look like befor  or in some sens what the date committe was look at that led them to  put in that sentenc about septemb
i think what the date committe was react to primarili was that  until septemb    the depth criterion hadn   t been met   it was that event  with the rapid falloff in activ after septemb     which in their mind push the preponder of evid over the line
it was also the durat issu as well  i think  becaus befor septemb    peopl thought that the chanc of the economi turn around in the short run were greater
is there ani chanc those data may get revis so that the shallow recess will be veri difficult to find without a magnifi glass
it   s conceiv   certain doug elmendorf   s and   dynan   s work with gdp data suggest that those data are suscept to great revis   that   s not the main focus of the date committe   s examin   they tend to reli on month indic   but  as you know  the contour of those indic can be revis on the basi of new inform  inde  it was onli a matter of a few day after the nber committe made their announc  as i recal  that our industri product folk issu a comprehens revis of the ip index  which push back the peak in ip to sever month earlier   so  these determin of a particular month for the peak are alway difficult to make  as the nber emphas in their announc   as the revis sort out  it will be interest to see whether the clariti of the peak determin improv and whether the date is shift
if i may ask  am i correct that the onli statist that peak in march was employ
that   s correct
industri product had peak much earlier anyway
it peak earlier   and sever month earlier after the revis
yes  but even with the revis the nber date was still valid
i just want to ask a question about the order data  where we   ve seen some posit news   of cours  this was at a  e when there was a strong expect that a tax cut for busi would be enact to encourag order   my recollect is that it was go to be retroact   at least in the bill that was introduc   as well   i was just wonder if this is someth that we should be concern about   do you think peopl were order in anticip of that legisl be enact wherea obvious  at this point  it is unlik to be enact
that   s certain a possibl   but i   m not awar that we were hear a great number of stori along those line from our busi contact
you had done some survey work at that  e as to what the impact of  those tax cut would be   did you get ani insight base on that
i agre with larri   we did not hear ani report of actual anticipatori order on the basi of the possibl enact of that expens provis   so while that   s certain a possibl  as you note  i don   t think i would give much weight to that as be a factor
excus me   whi would a firm take anticipatori action when there   s the chanc that it would put itself on the wrong side of the date when the tax would take effect
well  it was go to be retroact
well  busi firm can   t be sure of that   that   s the point   the one thing they can be sure of is that the provis will be effect subsequ to the legisl   but they don   t know how far back it would go  even if the congress did make it retroact
on this particular point  i heard some busi contact say they were delay order  wait until they saw the shape of the legisl
if anyth  i think that was the kind of report that we were hear from our busi contact as well
dave  i have a question about the three month diffus index for payrol employ at the bottom of chart     could you repeat what you said   i thought i heard you say someth about     larg firm
the bls put out an array of these seri   one set in the seri has to do with the total privat nonfarm sector  the other has to do with the manufactur sector   this is from the former constel   within that there are one month  three month  and six month diffus index   this is the three month version of that   there are     so call three digit industri in the nonfarm privat sector   this is a diffus index of the chang in payrol employ in each of those industri over a three month period   a read abov    indic that more industri report a payrol employ increas than a decreas
okay   mayb you can help me out further   i have a question on the    contribut to the initi recoveri in real gdp    illustr at the bottom of chart   and the differ in the contribut of the consum sector      interest sensit element of household spend     i think is what you said   we went through a period when recess had    vic     sector   inflat would push up nomin interest rate  which would lead to disintermedi becaus of regul q   the hous and auto sector would get clobber   and then we   d get a big snapback recoveri   we don   t have that occur this  e   so when we look at someth like a diffus index of employ  know the natur of what caus  contract in the past  are we look at the same thing
it   s a truism that everi busi cycl is differ  and no doubt that appli here as well   there is anoth factor go on in the background at the same  e   while it may be that previous the recess itself was more concentr in certain sector  as you suggest  most of these earlier episod were deeper as well   all that is requir for an industri to contribut to a read below    is for it to have a declin in employ   so if the absolut depth of a recess is greater  one would expect the dispers magnitud to go lower even if the recess is more concentr by industri
okay  that help me   thank you
i have a coupl of question about the  book project   how much of the declin in consumpt for the current quarter is model driven and how much of that is judgment  driven primarili i suppos by the assumpt that the automobil surg in the fourth  quarter was borrow from this year
when we do our current quarter es  for consumpt        q  be the current quarter now   it pretti much is not model driven
so it   s most judgment
it   s base on a sever factor   one is the pattern of the month data as we move into the quarter   in part the pce project is driven by what we think we know about auto sale even in januari  which play a role there   so we   re think about those kind of thing much more than ani consumpt model
what i   d like to press you on much more than that  though  has to do with the inventori situat   it seem to me that the outlin that you have for busi fix invest and consumpt make a lot of sens  given what we know about those sector   but dure the near term  activ in those sector is go to be driven a lot by what happen to inventori   at least the way i read the situat  the liquid of inventori in the four quarter of last year was the largest for ani four quarter period sinc we   ve had quarter data  go back in it earliest day to about        i   m use the macroeconom advis    assumpt for fourth quarter inventori invest  a veri big negat number   so we   ve had  i think by ani measur  a veri larg inventori liquid   in the past when we   ve had signific inventori liquid  we   ve had some substanti accumul   not just the swing that occur go from a big negat number to about zero   if consumpt turn out to be reason decent   and by that i don   t mean rapid growth but even just zero   it would seem to me that the pattern in the  book has a great deal of upsid uncertainti or risk to it   i believ your assumpt is for a veri gradual increas in inventori invest   small posit number  that are grow as we go into next year   we could have a veri signific upward surpris   i just want you to comment on that calcul
an import consider in our mind as we look beyond the current quarter or so is some notion of a target inventori sale ratio   we think these target ratio have been on a downtrend for at least the past decad and mayb longer   in order to get a forecast that has a target inventori sale ratio that behav the way we think it should  we basic need to have busi get rid of the excess inventori that built up in late      through        a  process that is go on now   we think those inventori sale ratio are general in a rang that is close to the target level   so  after firm get rid of their excess inventori  they have product and final sale grow in line with each other  as the panel at the bottom of chart    show  in order to keep those ratio from go back up again  that   s the logic behind our forecast   you can quibbl about the exact number  but that   s the basic philosophi that we use
that   s certain consist with all the anecdot we   re hear as well   that   s exact what they have in mind
okay  let   s recess until tomorrow morn   i understand  that this room will be secur so if you   d like to leav paper here  feel free to do so   at      p m  we will have cocktail   doubl martini and the usual  laughter    follow by a dinner dure which we will honor larri    who is still legal a board member until januari    at midnight ea n  e    laughter   meet recess  januari            page    of     januari            morn session
we are now back in session   befor we go to a general committe discuss of the economi  are there ani residu question left over from last night for the chart show particip   yes  governor
i don   t have a question   but mayb it would be help for everybodi if the staff would just run down the gdp number releas this morn and note how they compar with what was in the  book
with the chairman   s permiss
i   d say a coupl of thing about this morn   s gdp releas   first of all  in broad term the stori is veri similar to the one that we had in the  book  which was that there was veri strong growth in final sale in the fourth quarter and that was substanti met by a veri signific liquid of inventori   so in that sens  i see noth either in the top line or in the composit that suggest ani major discrep  now  split the hair  the gdp figur was stronger than we had project   as   and larri indic ye day  we alreadi had move our forecast up close to zero on the basi of the shipment and order figur that we   d seen  so part of that we had alreadi incorpor  but final sale in the gdp releas were just a bit weaker than what we had project  and the inventori drawdown was not quit so larg as we had forecast   that by itself might impli less upward momentum in the first quarter   but as   and larri note ye day  the order figur that we got for decemb were strong enough to make us think that we   d probabl be revis up our invest forecast in the first quarter  so i   d say on net this   veri littl to chang our outlook  one other interest piec of inform in this releas is that the implic of these data for fourth quarter product are that nonfarm busi output per hour probabl rose     percent   we had alreadi incorpor a strong product figur in the forecast  but that   s even stronger than our project   so that piec of the forecast  too  certain look firm in place  and if anyth   if this number hold up in subsequ revis   is even better than we  had been expect
are both the inventori and the intern figur base on two month of data essenti
yes  that   s right
so it   s all subject to possibl revis
inde   and i would say that at least a part of the discrep on the inventori side is attribut to a differ assumpt for decemb  we had somewhat more runoff built into our forecast than bea has   there are not just miss data but  of cours  revis to earlier figur as well   the retail sale number stand out as an import one that is subject to substanti revis and that could have an effect on these figur
i have one
you have a question or you want to start the committe  discuss
i have a question
first of all  i just want to say that i thought the chart show present ye day was veri well done and extrem clear on all the under factor of the  book forecast   i was interest  though  in peopl   s assess of where they thought the major risk were  particular in term of the fragil of the consum   there are aspect of  this more posit gdp report that in my mind call into question a littl more how much strength is there or how much of the strength is borrow from
as you know  through the fall we highlight the consum sector as an area where we thought there were some potenti risk  especi as the unemploy rate rose sharpli and the labor market deterior   at least accord to this preliminari es   it look as if consum spend rose     percent at a  e when the economi lost near a million nonfarm payrol job   consum sen ent has remain firmer than we had been anticip earlier   auto sale   where again we had at first discount veri heavili the increas in motor vehicl sale  figur the payback would be both prompt and signific   have remain much more resili than we had anticip   so i see the near term downsid risk  while still veri larg  as have diminish somewhat   but over the forecast period we do see consum have to swim upstream in some sens against the deterior in their overal net worth and balanc sheet posit  which lead us to think that there should be some under uptrend in the save rate   someth could happen to trigger a more rapid upward adjust in the save rate  i don   t know what that would be  but it certain loom out there as some risk  the other risk outsid the consum sector   and one we have tri to highlight in a number of altern simul and some of our brief  includ     s ye day   is that our profit outlook is definit weaker than what equiti analyst are current expect  that   s true  even make some adjust for the normal bias that they have in their forecast  our view is that the stock market will remain rather flat through the first half of this year and onli then begin to trend up   so there is still some tension  if you will  in our forecast between relat meager profit perform and what the market current seem to be anticip  that would be anoth downsid risk associ with the forecast  if earn disappoint were to show through more signific into lower share price go forward   now  that is balanc off by the fact that a number of small error in our project could make the profit outlook consider better   if we got just a littl more deceler in compens per hour  a littl better product perform as we have been see in recent quarter  and a littl firmer price   mayb a littl less disinfl than we are forecast   profit could be higher  and that could go a long way toward resolv what appear to be a tension in the current forecast  on the upsid  an issu that presid pool mention ye day is that we at least have to be awar of the fact that we could see a sharper snapback on the inventori invest side  this liquid was enorm in the fourth quarter and in our view firm still want to bring down inventori sale ratio   so the environ will be one in which  if we   re right about relat sluggish growth in final sale go forward  there isn   t ani press imper to restock quick or to end that liquid rapid   but just as we see inventori pile up in way that we can   t anticip  one could imagin get a sharper impetus from the end of the  inventori liquid and that could feed on itself and provid consider upward momentum to output go forward   so the risk to the forecast seem to me reason balanc   but i think we   re still confront a fair amount of uncertainti on both side of that project
may i ask a question   dave  the gdp price index  of cours  was down  what was the pce price index   the forecast in our project was a littl over   percent  but i have a feel it was quit differ
i don   t know the answer to that but let me see if i can look it up quick   it was     percent on the total price index  and the core was     percent
core was affect by insur premium  that   s the impress i got
what was the core
the core was      but that was again  as the chairman is indic  a revers of an insur effect  which had held down price signific in the third quarter
further question for     if not  who would like to start the roundtabl   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the tone of report from contact in the seventh district has improv signific sinc our decemb meet   at that  e i indic that most contact were not see sign of a bottom let alon a recoveri   now  report of stabil  bottom out  or near a bottom are more frequent and peopl seem less pessimist   no one is say activ is expand rapid  but there is a definit sens that condit are not get ani wors  particular in the manufactur sector   the latest chicago purchas manag    survey result  for exampl  show that  although the composit index remain below the    percent threshold  it did climb in januari to      percent   that was it highest level in thirteen month   the product compon rose to a level slight abov     percent in januari  also the first signal of expand product in thirteen month   let me note that these result should be treat confidenti until they are releas tomorrow  in the auto industri  sale of light vehicl came down from the lofti level record in octob and novemb but with incent remain generous  sale continu to surpris on the upsid in decemb and  accord to our contact  in januari as well   last week we had a meet with auto compani repres and industri analyst and their forecast for light  vehicl sale in      have been rais   they now rang from      to      million unit  with auto manufactur be more conserv than the industri analyst   product has been pick up somewhat  in part to replenish dealer inventori that were extrem lean at the end of last year  in the airlin industri  although air traffic remain    to    percent below year ago level  both unit and boe indic that they see a slow but steadi improv in travel  which they expect to continu throughout the year   after be weak in the fourth quarter  demand for corrug box was describ as fair strong so far in januari  and contact report that machin tool order have either bottom or turn up   sign of improv in manufactur at this point general are seen as reflect effort by firm to rebuild inventori  and a concern go forward is whether there will be suffici final demand to sustain a recoveri   on that issu  none of our contact with market abroad note ani strengthen in export demand   more often  concern were voic about weak abroad and particular about condit in japan   in term of capit spend  we have not heard ani report that suggest firm are increas invest or plan to do so soon   busi seem to be continu to delay even product enhanc capit expenditur as one way of conserv cash and boost profit at least in the short term  so  in term of look for strength in final demand  we   re back to depend on the consum where the stori is mix but seem somewhat more promis than a month or so ago  residenti hous market  for exampl  have held up quit well  perhap reflect more favor weather in the midwest   overal  total holiday season sale were slight better than had been expect  and inventori general remain in control   after a slow start to the holiday shop season  sale improv over the last two week of decemb and have continu to show relat strength so far in januari   as is usual the case  result vari consider across differ type of retail and merchandis in a season mark by heavi discount and extend shop hour  one firm headquart in our district that did veri poor was kmart  which as you know file for chapter    protect last week   kmart has signific long term problem that mani peopl in the retail industri have been talk about for some  e   but our contact indic that the speed with which their financ sourc dri up larg reflect a spillov effect from the extens public surround enron  futur strength in consum spend and hous will hing in part on employ prospect   on that score  report suggest that labor market in our region are still weak  howev  the rate of job loss appear to have eas in some area  and there have been scatter report of some new hire   contact at two larg nation temporari help firm indic that  while condit were basic flat or near bottom in that industri  there were earli sign of improv in the demand for worker in manufactur  turn to the nation outlook  the key question are when the recoveri will begin and how robust it will be onc it take hold   on the first question  the evid increas point to  the economi be near a bottom  and obvious today   s gdp report reinforc that   for some  e i   ve been concern that rise unemploy would erod incom and confid enough to caus a more signific slide in household spend  which could lead to a wider and deeper recess   but the recent drop in unemploy insur claim and the broad base increas in the workweek are signal that the deterior in labor market condit may be near an end   to be sure  the sign of a bottom out are still tentat and not univers   for exampl  the demand for temporari worker  usual a lead indic of labor market condit  remain weak as i mention earlier   and  of cours  we could still get some downsid surpris  regard the strength of the recoveri onc it begin  sever factor suggest that growth may be more restrain than is typic in post recessionari period   for instanc  given the recent pace of vehicl and new home sale  it   s hard to imagin that there is much pent up demand for consum durabl or new home   moreov  consum like have not yet fulli factor the declin in equiti market into their save decis   and with profit and capac util still low and uncertainti high  busi are like to be slow to increas capit spend   on the other hand  given what look to have been an extraordinari pace of inventori liquid last quarter  we should get a fair good size pop from inventori  a point that tie in with the discuss we were just have   and  of cours  there is still signific polici s ulus in the pipelin   moreov  product growth has been veri well maintain  again as evidenc in today   s data  which should provid a foundat for growth in incom and household spend  weigh all the factor  we think that the most like outcom is for slight stronger growth in      than in the  book project   but the level of uncertainti remain high   in addit to the risk that i mention  there is reason to be concern about a further deterior in the intern situat as well as fallout from

thank you  mr  chairman   the new england economi continu to  slow in decemb  but the pace of it declin moder   inde  the avail inform from a wide rang of contact with district busi and the bank   s director suggest some light at the end of the tunnel   uncertainti remain high  howev  and caution is like to character busi spend  bank lend  and labor market develop for some  e  employ in the region declin in decemb and was below year earlier level in all state except rhode island   help want advertis and week hour work in manufactur declin as well   but the pace of declin in all of these indic was more moder than earlier in the quarter   and the region unemploy rate did not chang at all   inde  the region   s unemploy rate is near   percentag point lower than the nation   s  a surpris fact given the import of high tech busi in the area   residenti real estat market remain healthi  with perhap a better align of suppli and demand   and hous construct continu to hold up reason well  probabl becaus of rather mild winter weather  retail trade seem to hold up fair well through the new year  with report of crowd shop mall and consum will to take advantag of the mani discount avail  inde  for some product  discount weren   t necessari to encourag buy   one of the bank   s director  a manufactur of veri high end audio equip  report the best decemb ever  with sale that continu to

 the avail lead indic data for massachusett have turn up as well  with sign of a weak recoveri emerg through the first half of the year  so much for the light at the end of the tunnel   what about uncertainti   two area are worthi of note in that regard  state and local spend and the attitud of region busi  especi manufactur  toward invest and the labor market   within the region a serious fiscal crisi is loom in the three southern new england state   connecticut  massachusett   and rhode island are face budgetari difficulti not unlik those experienc dure the late     s and earli     s   the three northern state face problem as well  though the sever is much less   state revenu collect over the first half of fiscal year      are much lower than in the same period in fiscal year       with declin of some magnitud in both general revenu and sale tax in massachusett and rhode island   onli new hampshir has manag to increas it revenu  larg through an increas tax rate   a solut that seem polit unfeas elsewher   inde  increas tax in new hampshir are a bit of a histor anomali  probabl best explain as a way out of a court mandat school fund problem   in massachusett the fund challeng is be met in part by cut in mani type of social spend   one save grace is that all the new england state have much deeper fiscal reserv than were avail dure the recess of the earli     s   the question is how fast these reserv will be deplet  manufactur contact in earli januari spoke of the emerg light at the end of the tunnel that i note earlier   howev  they also note their determin to be as conserv as possibl in      given great uncertainti about how long the tunnel might eventu be and how bright the light   most manufactur contact report that capit spend would be tight control this year   custom of high tech firm are report express caution about capit spend in the first half of      and have a wait and see attitud about the second half  some report that      it budget are down or flat and that compani are defer implement of new applic and demand more return from their current it invest   preserv cash flow is at a premium  which will like mean that inventori will be kept as low as possibl for as long as possibl   in sum  new england contact expect a recoveri in       but they do not see it as robust   as a result they   re hedg their bet  reduc spend if they can  hire judici if at all  and wait to see how thing play out  on the nation scene  i see the same mixtur of hope about the near term and uncertainti that is reflect in the region   certain the incom data suggest that the economi perhap is bottom out and that activ may well be in the process of turn up   employ loss have begun to slow   claim data suggest that the rise trajectori in the unemploy rate could well flatten   and the steep fall in inventori invest in the last quarter certain hold out a real promis for increas growth in the near term   if inventori just stop fall  the impact on growth would be sizabl  now  sooner or later inventori can no longer be drawn down  just as a matter of physic realiti   we may be come closer to that point  though inventori sale ratio suggest that this will be an uneven process at best   what would help is the continu of relat solid consum demand   i wrote these comment last night  but that thought is reinforc by the gdp data releas today   certain the q  number on consumpt are eye open   but i keep ask myself how long consum will keep buy home and car and whether even the relat mute contribut to growth in      expect from purchas of consum durabl is realist   as i see it  the consum is a major risk   if spend continu  even despit tepid corpor profit growth and like rise unemploy   though not so much as we had expect   then busi will feel more confid not onli in stop inventori liquid but also in begin to spend on new inventori and addit to capit   some of this busi spend may be happen alreadi  as seen in data relat to chip product and in recent order data   but as i see it anyway  the futur hing on the consum  turn to the outlook  the boston fed   s assess of the prospect for the upcom year  at least as reflect in headlin macroeconom data  is not terribl differ from the board staff   s  book forecast   we see real growth in the mid   percent area  inflat as measur by the pce at     percent  and unemploy in the fourth quarter around   percent  but the  book has polici tighten at that point  and we don   t   we question whether that would be necessari   at that point in the forecast the economi is grow at about it potenti but just for two quarter   after about two year of growth below potenti  inflat is quit low  and the unemploy rate is well abov both what we experienc in the late     s without much inflat and what statist exercis now suggest is the level at which labor market can function without inflat   whi would polici need to be tighten   the bluebook suggest that we would tighten becaus we want the rate of inflationari growth to settl in at   percent   i wonder whether that is in fact what we want and whether it is ideal to have unemploy remain as relat high into      as it   in the bluebook simul  in that regard i find myself attract  though reluct  to the    inflat cushion    scenario in the bluebook  with all that impli about the need for further polici s ulus sooner  rather than later   whi do i say reluct   well  for one thing  i don   t think the u s  economi face a major deflationari risk   we talk about this a bit ye day   i see growth in product  real wage  level of confid  and the health of the bank system as all say that a major deflationari spiral is not like   i   m uneasi about reduc rate to ever lower histor low onli becaus it seem to impli a sens of deep concern about the prospect for the economi that i don   t share   moreov  it leav much less room if the economi realli   get bad   i also am quit agnost about the abil of ani of us in boston or  with apolog to the board staff  in the forecast communiti more general to get the number right over as long a period as a coupl of year ahead   just a glanc at our collect humphrey hawkin forecast of last juli for      and      encourag some humil   howev  the shape of the outcom in the    inflat cushion    simul   with a fa  rate of declin in unemploy  a rate of inflat that still start with    and presum a bit higher growth   look rather good   i just wish i felt more comfort that i was sure how to get there  in the short term and for the purpos of this meet  i do see reason to believ that a recoveri is under way  albeit perhap a slow one   i think the risk remain on the downsid  those risk includ the potenti for earn disappoint and the effect that could have on equiti market  on unemploy  and eventu on the consum  the continu econom challeng face by our major trade partner  less fiscal s ulus than had been expect  and the high risk premium in credit and capit market   but i also believ that current polici is s ul  so at this point wait out the uncertainti seem the most prudent cours   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i read the report from the first district as  be rather cautious or even downbeat   i must say that the view from st  loui is a good bit more op ist   i tri to convinc presid   to accept a bet ye day on the super bowl   i offer her a case of budweis against a case of lob   and she just wasn   t interest   laughter
somehow  even i know the valu of the two
i tri to smoke out her odd  so i suggest a case of bud against a lob  dinner  and she still wasn   t interest   then i said    how about against a lob  claw      laughter
i just got over feel good that our new england team didn   t disgrac themselv    laughter
well  we   re a littl more op ist than that in st  loui
ned just realiz that this discuss was about footbal    laughter
i thought you were talk about the econom outlook
well  let me comment on some of the report from our district  incident  wal mart is headquart in our district and is do just fine  mr
we notic    laughter
i talk to my contact at wal mart on januari      he said that decemb sale at wal mart came in substanti better than had been anticip  sale at compar store were up     percent over the prior year   and at that point in januari  sale were run abov plan  at better than   percent year over year   he indic that they had becom cautious op ist   befor they had believ that the turnaround was go to occur in the third quarter  and now they   re anticip a notic turnaround in the second quarter   he note that their inventori situat is the best they   ve had in the last four year  it   s veri low and exact where desir   they are total clean out of season merchandis   but he went on to say that actual in some respect they end up with too littl inventori   ordinarili they reli on sale after christma  but they didn   t have a lot of merchandis to put on sale becaus the inventori had been pretti well clear out   he mention that wal mart is order good now  particular from asian supplier  for next fall but is order veri cautious  expect thing to remain about the same   they don   t see themselv in a posit yet to order aggress   he also note  though  that there   s someth of an inconsist in the natur of the demand that they see   discretionari item such as electron   cathi made a comment about that   sold veri well dure the holiday season  and yet consum continu to go for good at the entri level price across a wide rang of product   so in apparel or electron or ani of a broad rang of good  consum are general buy the lowest price item in a particular line   my up contact spent quit a bit of  e talk about the labor situat   the compani   s contract with the team  expir in juli  and they   ve alreadi start negoti on a new contract   that actual was report in the newspap just a day or two ago   both up and the team  are well awar of the fact that the strike they had sever year ago was veri disrupt and harm to the compani   s busi   my contact said that they alreadi are see some sign that their custom are make altern arrang for ship   and  of cours  they are concern about lose that busi perman if custom develop relationship with other shipper   but he anticip that they will be settl that labor contract earli and will get it out of the way   he also comment that they view the outlook as fair flat  given that their custom are not show a great deal of op    inventori are veri lean  firm just don   t want to carri inventori   so  he was not terribl upbeat   on the other hand  my contact at fedex said that although they haven   t seen much sign of a pickup as yet  they are expect increas volum   the custom that fedex talk with are anticip increas ship need  particular becaus of the need to rebuild inventori   last  my contact at j b  hunt  a truck firm  note that they don   t see busi pick up as yet  let me make a comment about the prospect go forward   i want to start with an interpret of what happen after septemb      my interpret is that a lot of busi leader were unnerv by those event and they went into someth of a cash preserv mode   they laid off a lot of peopl  they cut order  they did not make ani commit that they didn   t feel they realli need to make   but consumpt demand remain surpris strong   though busi peopl are still in a rather cautious mood  i think that  if we can get by for a few more month  some of that caution is go to begin to turn   so  my instinct is that some  this year we   re go to see some inventori restock that will be big enough to skew the gdp number upward for a quarter or two   but obvious a lot is go to depend on the mainten of consumpt demand in order for that to work through   i don   t have ani particular disagr with the  book forecast except possibl on the inventori side  which i talk about ye day   i think there is much more of an upsid risk there than a downsid risk   thank you
mr  chairman  if we look at the actual statist on current econom activ in our district  i think we   d have to say it   s still edg lower   let me cite a coupl of exampl   retail sale in particular have weaken most recent  accord to a month survey we conduct  factori shipment are down in our district  unemploy rate have risen in sever state  and we   re still see plenti of layoff announc   despit that  similar to the comment we   ve heard this morn about other region  my sens is that the overal health of the district is improv   when one take into account anecdot inform  more recent data  busi expect  and indic of what actual is happen current  i think there have been improv  the pictur in manufactur  which of cours is veri import in our district  is clear better   new order appear to be rise  inventori of both finish and intermedi good are in  better shape now than they have been for some  e  and capac util is increas in at least some industri   and we hear some report that earlier decis to freez capit spend have been relax to some extent  which i think is encourag   the outlook for the furnitur industri  which is one of our most import industri  is particular bright now   sale are increas   a lot of those sale are clear sale of import good  but our own factori still get a good share of the busi  and they are more op ist than they   ve been in a while   and for the first  e in a long  e there are actual sign of life in the textil industri   that might be relat to the strength of furnitur sale   i   m not sure   but it is a veri encourag develop   so overal  i think the situat is clear better in our district  like most other who have spoken  i certain feel better about the outlook for the nation economi than i did at the novemb or decemb fomc meet   the appar increas in domest final purchas in the fourth quarter   i guess it   s more than appar now  perhap at least semi offici given today   s report   is realli quit remark consid the situat we were look at and the project that were be made for that period not veri long ago   the milder than expect declin in busi equip spend  appar driven in larg measur by spend on comput hardwar and softwar  is especi encourag   i mention this at the region level  but it   s the case nation as well  that the strong overal demand   seem to be drive inventori down   and that is improv the outlook pictur  the  book project say that the economi is bottom out  and we certain have more reason to believ that may be the case now than we did not veri mani week ago   the project recoveri is veri much in line with the anecdot inform we   re receiv from our own busi contact   for the most part they are much more sanguin about their individu industri and busi than they were befor the holiday  so  all in all  i think the  book forecast is plausibl and it rest on a stronger foundat than it did a month ago  when much of the emphasi was on the expect fiscal  s ulus packag   it seem fair clear to me that the risk in the forecast are better balanc now than they were at the  e of our decemb meet   but i still believ that the risk are tilt to the downsid   as the  book point out   and i don   t think the number releas this morn chang this observ   the strong overal final sale perform in the fourth quarter was driven in larg part by the extraordinari volum of car sale and the fallout from that   i think that   s someth we need to rememb   the sale incent program were truli unpreced  and i think the unusu warm weather play a role in help to keep hous activ up   these favor condit probabl won   t be sustain fulli  so we may well get  some weak number in the week immedi ahead   and with the unemploy rate like to continu to increas  some less bullish econom report   especi if we have some further deterior in equiti market   could feed back into consum attitud and ul  into consum spend   so  i think we need to keep that in mind   i don   t view the situat as fragil   i wouldn   t say that   but i don   t think it   s as firm as some of the headlin number might suggest   my bottom line is that it   s more plausibl now than it was at the  e of the last meet to believ that we might have eas as much as we   re go to need to eas in this cycl   but with inflat and inflat expect still well contain and with the downsid risk still out there  i think we need to continu to be in a posit to eas polici further if necessari   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   last  e i report that econom condit in the third district appear to be stabil   this  e i can report that condit in the district are improv somewhat   retail sale of general merchandis exceed the pessimist forecast for the christma season and were about even with last year in real term  hous activ  while not as strong as in the nation  remain healthi   nonresidenti construct contract increas for the fourth consecut month in decemb   i should note  howev  that some of those increas repres state and local govern project  which may not be sustain given the deterior fiscal situat in our three state   while some bank have tighten term select for the lowest credit qualiti borrow  our bank and busi contact report no evid of a credit crunch  but the best news come from our januari busi outlook survey  bos  of region manufactur   the index of general activ turn posit for the first  e in fourteen month   the swing was signific from a read of minus   in decemb to plus    in januari  indic that    percent more of our manufactur report an increas in activ than report a decreas in januari   the histor data on this index show that the current swing  of almost    point is larger than the usual swing from negat to posit at the trough of the bos index   analysi also indic that the swing in the index from negat to posit is typic not a fals signal  such a swing usual occur near the end of recess   mani of the other measur in our survey show a similar pattern in januari   in particular  the new order index and the shipment index turn posit  and the magnitud of the swing exceed their averag swing at a trough   respond continu to be op ist about futur activ  although they remain cautious about hire plan   thirteen percent of those survey plan further cut in their workforc this year   half of the firm plan to hire or rehir worker this year  but most will delay the hire until the second quarter or later  anoth piec of posit news from our survey was a notic improv in plan for capit expenditur   the index post it highest read in sixteen month  with near    percent of firm expect to increas capit spend over the next six month   the relat  weak demand for labor but more bullish outlook for capit spend is consist with the secular upward trend in product in the manufactur sector   the more posit bos number and the fact that the gain are fair widespread among the industri cover in our survey suggest that the foundat for econom recoveri is in place in our district  the more posit news from the third district is consist with recent data on the nation economi   in light of recent develop mani forecast  includ the board staff  now project an earli end to this recess   most see the end in the first quarter  notwithstand the data that just came out   inde  the forecast see under econom strength now compar with previous forecast sinc in fact the sizabl fiscal s ulus is no longer assum in the project  my own view continu to be a bit less op ist for the short run   i believ that the fundament support an econom recoveri but that we are unlik to see ani substant recoveri until the second quarter   the recent releas gdp number chang this view somewhat  but i still remain concern about the short run   consum spend is the linchpin of our forecast   as growth in consum spend acceler  inventori cut end and inventori build resum  follow eventu by a pickup in invest spend  which help solidifi the recoveri   this is the most like outcom   the recoveri in consum confid sinc septemb    and the fact that debt servic burden remain at manag level are all posit factor for the consum   howev  there is some risk that continu increas in unemploy will have a damp effect on consum confid  incom  and spend   and while the recoveri of the stock market sinc septemb    is a posit  the declin in equiti price over the past year will make the consum more cautious  then there is the link to inventori   obvious  inventori must turn as sale continu to exceed product   but the busi communiti is extrem cautious  and i expect that the inventori adjust will be slower than mani anticip   therefor  i share the  book   s general view that the recoveri will proceed relat slowli  at least at first   on averag in postwar recess the acceler in growth between the recess trough and the first quarter after the trough has been about   or   percentag point  as was note ye day by the board  staff   our own forecast is for about half that much this  e   we don   t expect a strong resurg  in part becaus we expect this recess to be relat mild   also  the inventori swing in our forecast is less sharp than that in the  book   i   ll point out that one of our major miss in last year   s forecast was a prematur call to the end of the inventori cycl  that said  i do note that forecast tend to underes  the strength of recoveri and  in particular  underes  the respons of output growth to expansionari monetari polici  and such a polici has been in place for the last year   there is signific monetari s ulus still in the pipelin and s ulus from fiscal polici is alreadi in place   both of these factor should support continu spend  although i believ inflat   or deflat for that matter   is not a problem at the moment  i   m less op ist than the  book about the longer run inflat outlook   inde  if the recoveri turn out to be stronger than expect  the committe will need to revers cours sooner and more sharpli than is incorpor in mani forecast   we need to begin prepar the public and the market for the inevit chang in our polici cours   thank you
mr  chairman  one advantag that texa has over mani other state is our billboard   we have a lot of high qualiti billboard in texa    laughter   i was in san antonio last week and on the way to the dalla fort worth airport i saw a huge billboard that said    san antonio love god  countri  and support free enterpris      that   s probabl the reason that texa has done better than the rest of the countri over the last eleven year   but on the way to the dalla fort worth airport to come to this meet i saw an even better billboard   it also was veri larg  and it was an ad for the classifi section of the fort worth newspap   it said     make alan  span proud   sell someth       laughter   mr  chairman  i thought you were encourag buy rather than sell   at ani rate  we   re tri to do our part to make you proud of texa  i help cut the ribbon on the new headquart build for the american airlin credit union last week   it   s the fourth largest credit union in the countri   i learn dure the cours of  that event that the credit union has taken on some of the furlough american airlin employe and also that some relat entiti have hire other   then i later learn   and i don   t think this receiv much public   that american airlin was take back sever hundr of it furlough employe   as i recal  the number rehir was     in total and a littl over     in the dalla fort worth area   i think it is that sort of thing that goe on behind the scene without much public that help to explain the appar contradict of continu announc of larg layoff at the same  e that we   re see declin new claim for unemploy insur   continu with airlin  i   m told that air travel was down    percent in octob from the previous octob  off just a littl over    percent in novemb  and down less than    percent in decemb   so the airlin industri seem to be recov somewhat  that   s favor for texa becaus texa is the headquart of three major airlin   american  continent  and southwest   southwest traffic by the way was up a littl last year over year earlier level  let me say a word about mexico  which is also import to our economi in sever way   the boom of the late     s drove our border town unemploy rate down below    percent for the first  e ani of our director from that part of texa could rememb   the econom slowdown that has taken place sinc then has not revers that as much as we had expect   there is grow anecdot evid that this may be due to mexican immigr depart the unit state in search of a better life in mexico   mexican consul report a dramat jump in applic for the document use by illeg immigr to make a legal cross into mexico   mayb i ought to repeat that    laughter   there has been a jump in applic for the document use by illeg immigr to make a legal cross into mexico  as for those come the other way  immigr arrest fell    percent in the first nine month of      and fell    percent in the fourth quarter compar with the fourth quarter the year befor  these factor have contribut to our border unemploy rate go up less than the rate have risen in the central texa citi   stay with the subject of mexico for a minut  i onc told governor ortiz that he had onli two kind of monetari polici   tight and tighter   that has paid off on the inflat rate  which drop to a record low of     percent last year   earlier this month  fitch   s upgrad mexico   s sovereign debt to invest grade   moodi   s had done so earlier  but standard   poor   s has not act yet   there seem to have been veri littl fallout on mexico from argentina   s problem   the peso has appreci over the last year by a littl more than   percent in term of the strong u s  dollar   the mexican economi is in a recess  but this is the first  e mexico has had a recess without a financi crisi   our manufactur recess  which began befor march       was transmit to industri mexico befor our overal economi was deem to be in recess   in other word  our slow economi was transmit to mexico as a recess becaus of the concentr of our slowdown in manufactur and their heavi manufactur compon   longer term  howev  there is concern that mexico   s prosper along the border  especi in the maquiladora industri  may have made it uncompetit in futur year vis  vis china and other countri with lower wage than mexico  the greater dalla area has been the region in texa most advers affect by the slowdown and recess becaus of the area   s heavi concentr of high tech industri  especi high tech telecom firm   the comput high tech sector is show sign of stabil or even rebound a bit  but there are no sign of that as yet in the telecom sector  energi  which is often a countercycl forc in texa  has weaken recent along with other sector   the rig count has declin substanti  and energi employ has declin somewhat   twelv of the twenti largest citi in texa had higher sale tax receipt in novemb than a year ago  and that includ the larg citi of houston and san antonio as well as mcallen  which is near the border   most of the declin in sale tax revenu were concentr in dalla and it nearbi suburb  where the telecom corridor is locat  for me the signific develop in the nation economi is that data that had been uniform bad have recent turn mix and  in fact  most recent have been almost uniform posit   i have in mind  for exampl  the rebound in consum confid  the lead indic  and the index of manufactur activ   the declin inventori deplet that will probabl take place in the current quarter is like to give a confid build boost to the headlin gdp number   but as the staff has point out  the real question is the sustain of the initi boost the economi will get from a turnaround in inventori liquid   we have no quarrel with the broad outlin of the  book forecast and the staff analysi   we tend to agre with their view  and we think the staff project is about right   if anyth  i   m a bit more op ist   person  i wouldn   t be surpris if the fourth quarter gdp number came in as a small

thank you  mr  chairman   the latest read on the district economi are consist with what we   ve been see and say about the busi news more broad  consum spend has been strong  particular for home furnish  electron  auto  and at bar and restaur   hous had a veri good year in        construct activ was strong  and home sale were at record level   and realtor are op ist  they think      will be even better than        on the other hand  layoff have continu   but the unemploy rate districtwid and in the major metropolitan area such as the twin citi remain in the neighborhood of   percent   that suggest that a lot of the laid off worker either have been absorb elsewher in the economi or perhap have chosen to spend a few month in florida or arizona  as minnesotan are wont to do this  e of year  and wait thing out there   manufactur is struggl but   appear to be stabil   and i would say that the tourism busi has been advers affect by the weather   the weather has been too good   but the other side of the coin is that the mild weather has had a veri favor effect on household util bill  which are run well below last year   s  as far as the nation outlook is concern  i think the prospect for the economi are favor   i don   t have ani signific quarrel with the  book forecast   my own view is that the first half of the year will probabl be a bit slower than in the  book and that the second half may be a littl stronger  but overal the differ is not signific   our var  forecast model  which has a pretti good track record except perhap at turn point   laughter  has the same general path as the  book  although a bit more subdu   certain there is some possibl that the consum will be a caus for concern  especi if labor market  condit deterior further or don   t even stabil   but i   m wonder whether there isn   t less of a my i about consum behavior than one might otherwis think   after all  dispos  incom has risen consist over mani year now and household net worth  while down from it march      peak  is still consider abov where it was five or ten year ago   against that background  i don   t find the ongo strength in consum spend all that big a surpris
thank you  mr  chairman   our district economi in term of the level of activ is still relat weak   but as other have said about their district  the sign are grow that the situat is like to improv  and there is a great deal more op  among manufactur and busi oper in the region   turn to manufactur for a minut  the level of activ in that sector remain low   our bank   s latest manufactur survey found that product was down again in decemb after improv somewhat in novemb  employ  new order  and capit spend were again low in decemb relat to a year ago  but import in my view  firm have becom consider more op ist about the  futur   mani more of them are predict a pickup in busi and actual are see some earli sign of improv in order   so  look forward  i think the situat is quit encourag   in term of our manufactur survey  the six month ahead index for product climb fair signific   grant  the rise was from a low level  but the index almost doubl   the new order index more than doubl  and raw materi inventori as well as finish good inventori increas rather signific accord to the survey   so  there is a fair strong posit attitud about the futur among manufactur   anecdot speak  i talk with sever manufactur who seem veri pleas with the inquiri they   re get and the order that are now be place   moreov  they were say almost uniform that their inventori level and those of their custom are such that they are hire or intend to hire peopl again   so there   s a great deal of posit news there  recogn  though  that these are improv from a low level  as for consum spend in our region  the stori is veri similar to what you   ve heard from other   retail throughout our district were veri pleas on balanc with the holiday season   they talk some about the extens discount  and they express concern about the pressur that has place on their profit   still  they are veri posit about the volum of  sale   auto sale  like elsewher  were veri strong   there is some concern about use car sale and about financ relat to earlier leas   a fair larg distributor in the denver region told us that each car come back in on a leas has about a        write down that someon has to absorb   so they are a littl worri about the impact that will have  the energi sector has slow   obvious  with price come down  the level of activ has back off consider throughout the district  more so in the oklahoma area than in the wyom area  though activ in wyom is still down   labor market continu to be fair easi in term of the abil to hire worker   it   s still rather easi to find new employe  and there are no real sign of wage pressur that anyon is talk to me about   the farm economi is legisl depend  so we   ll have to see how that develop   but overal  as i said  there are sign of improv  look at the nation pictur and compar our outlook with that of the board staff  we   re general in line with the  book forecast   we see a littl slower rebound as we get into       but activ pick up later  and for the year as a whole our forecast is about the same as the  book   s   one thing i consid import is that  as other have point out  the balanc of risk is shift   the risk are becom more balanc  though i   m not say that they are balanc at this point   and i think it is a fact that we continu to have a veri accommod monetari polici  which should be a posit factor for growth as we get further into      and beyond   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   overal busi condit in the sixth district are now more mix than i report at the last meet   while clear not as posit as some read the evid at the nation level  thing are margin less negat and at least are not inconsist with the suggest that activ may have bottom out   for exampl  our consum sector continu to display resili   most merchant note that sale had met or exceed their expect   but i must add that this was not the case for smaller specialti store   discount continu to be widespread  and the major of the peopl we talk with said that their profit margin were notic wors dure the fourth quarter than a year ago  the most posit report continu to come from discount retail like the wal mart of the world  whose profit margin were steadi and whose sale growth was higher   automobil sale remain solid but predict were down from their high level in novemb as the incent program play out   real estat agent and homebuild in our area note an improv in home sale in decemb from the novemb pace  and the volum of new permit issu remain strong  especi at the low end of the market  our import tourism industri and travel relat activ are still hurt  although we   re see some gradual improv   market such as orlando are under consider stress becaus of the low number of visitor and the abund of hotel space   the key factor in south and central florida has been the declin in the number of european visitor   airport traffic through miami intern airport was down    percent from year ago level  and advanc book at resort for the first quarter of      were    to    percent below last year   s level  report suggest that sever orlando hotel are in serious financi troubl  with a number of borrow have fail to make requir debt servic payment   addit  the corpor travel market remain soft   convent are not be cancel  but attend is low   report that car rental rate are begin to increas and the fact that airlin discount is be scale back may signal some improv in busi demand condit  our manufactur sector remain weak overal  and layoff continu at a fast pace in the apparel industri  which account for one third of the district   s job loss dure this contract  at the same  e  new order have improv for some produc of industri electron equip  and some firm have even note that they were rehir some staff and extend product hour   not surpris  produc of secur equip report strong growth in demand sinc septemb     and both lockhe martin and gulf stream continu to benefit from feder govern and foreign govern program and from the demand for privat secur plane travel  larg cost increas continu to be note in health care in the form of higher wage for health care worker and higher health insur cost to employ   banker in our region  while slight more op ist than in decemb  still report that they are flush with liquid  commerci loan demand is limit to nonexist   a contact at equifax  a lead provid of credit rate servic  indic in recent convers that the firm had sever new and veri attract credit relat product but was unabl to generat ani interest in them from their custom   the senior execut i talk with liken the hunker down of busi execut to a    deer in the headlight    phenomenon  commerci real estat market have remain weak in the district   state and local govern project  which as someon els note had taken up some of the slack as commerci project dri up  have now also slow mark as local govern face their own budget pressur   the ceo of one veri larg commerci builder told me on monday that he fear a signific gap in build activ befor it get restart  on the nation front  the recent flow of more posit inform  which mani of us have note in our public statement sinc the first of the year  suggest that we may now be at or near the bottom of the cycl   the deterior of the labor market seem to be eas  with averag hour wage and the workweek rise and jobless claim continu to fall   even small busi are note that some job are becom harder to fill   both of the consum confid survey  which i take as coincid indic  are now less weak   even manufactur  as measur by industri product and demand for core capit good  is less weak   also  the sign of renew demand for noncommun equip are encourag  while caution dictat that we not becom over confid and declar victori prematur  i find it interest and reassur that this is the first  e in three or four month that the profession outsid forecast  our own intern model  and the  book do not contain further downward revis   furthermor  with the except of argentina  forecast for the rest of the world have been revis upward  while the evid suggest that a recoveri is under way has becom more convinc  the strength of the recoveri onc we get past the initi boost from a signific inventori swing is less clear to me   like those who prepar the chart show for ye day afternoon  my staff devot consider  e in our brief earlier this week to look at how various sector behav in the quarter lead up to the recess   that work underscor how differ a number of import factor vari from other recent cycl   those differ and the question they rais about how the same sector will behav come out of this recess point out the uncertainti and the risk we face in tri to ascertain the shape and strength of the recoveri   i   m particular struck by the remark strong consum spend and hous number   like some other who have comment alreadi this morn  i think one can make a good case   and the  book has done that to some extent   that we are like to get onli modest addit contribut from those sector in come quarter   i may be even more cautious in my outlook for those area becaus i think there   s a reason high probabl that job loss still to come will be greater than in the  book baselin forecast   and therefor  the return to job growth may look more like what we saw after the         recess  busi are under more pressur than ever to show profit and veri like will continu to  squeez their labor cost  i have argu in the past that the outsid read of the implicit polici rule be follow by the fed is to cut the fund rate until we see sign of a turnaround in econom activ   the economi seem to be at that point   while further fiscal s ulus now look less like and probabl less need  signific monetari s ulus remain in the pipelin   think more now about the longer term path of polici  further eas at this point would appear to hamper our abil to return the fund rate to appropri level as we get into the recoveri  thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   those of you who live in the warmer climat of the nation probabl don   t realiz that we are now at the peak of the boat season in the north of the countri   that   s becaus boat is not about have a larg  expens piec of fiberglass bob up and down in a marina someplac   it   s about boat show becaus that   s where all of the real excit take place   the ten day long cleveland boat show conclud this past sunday   i report to you a year ago that a vendor of jet ski and person watercraft had sold onli   item last januari versus     the year befor   i had thought that that was actual a posit develop   so i rather reluct report that there has been a sharp rebound in person watercraft sale this year   in light of what peopl were report about the excit at the cleveland boat show  i did an internet search to see what was go on elsewher   the boat show season kick off everi year with the big show in new york at the javit center   this year attend at that show  which was held over the first nine day of the year  was over           accord to some vendor  they saw an increas of as much as    percent in sale  some boat dealer claim that half their sale occur dure the januari through april boat show season  so they take the strong sale in these first few show of the season as an indic that it may be a strong year   one industri analyst on boat offer the view that the rebound we   re see in that industri involv a shift in consum spend toward famili recreat   he claim that this is consist with a lot of other recent develop  such as more famili event at arena and entertain center   he believ peopl are substitut buy a boat  for exampl  instead of go to orlando or other so call famili destin  to achiev a sort of    feel good    effect  as a side note let me mention someth about auto show   a phenomenon kick off  of cours  with the big detroit show   this has noth to do with macroeconom  but we were told that the excit among the crowd was overwhelm at the gm exhibit   second in popular was chrysler  there were virtual no crowd and no excit at the ford exhibit   which underscor what we are alreadi see about that compani and the problem it is face  in the retail sector  even larg nation retail that had report declin in sale versus a year earlier express essenti relief that the declin were smaller than they had expect  certain by the end of septemb most peopl were mark down veri  veri sharpli their expect about fourth quarter sale   one director with a larg nation retail compani said     we were prepar for a complet disast  and it did not happen      let me note an interest twist regard what is go on in retail   which may feed into the gdp number releas this morn and may reflect my ignor about how those number are put togeth   a director said that  even with a year over year declin of onli about   percent  his compani experienc a much  much bigger increas in the volum of good move than he had thought possibl   then he said that  of cours  inventori were drop by more   i ask whi  and he said that his compani is run sale of    to    percent off  which mean that they have been lose money on all those discount item sold   he said that the cost of what come out of inventori is higher than the price that goe through the cash regist   i don   t know what deflat are be use to adjust these data  but it   s hard for me to understand how the commerc depart know how to do that   i don   t understand how commerc know what is actual move and what price are appropri   the deflat to use   for either the merchandis come out of inventori or that go through the check out stand   one final note on the retail sector   a number of director indic that we should expect in our region a  signific increas in unoccupi retail space becaus a number of store close in major urban metro area have been announc and our director think there will be more   from the manufactur standpoint  as in       s district  cautious op  was the general tone that we were hear from our contact except those involv in the manufactur of larg truck   eighteen wheeler   or relat industri   with the except of ford  the auto assembl and part plant all indic that they are oper at high level   and probabl reflect the unusu warm weather this winter  go on three month now  both residenti and nonresidenti construct are veri strong  at least on a season adjust basi  we   re told that manufactur of electron  plastic  and chemic are now see the first improv in order in a year   a larg region bank said that it now has open for       januari             page    of     peopl and is offer exist employe a      referr bonus for bring in someon who is hire and stay with the bank for at least six month  on the nation front  in term of this  book versus the last one  i probabl would not have mark down the second half as much as the staff did becaus of the absenc of fiscal s ulus   then again  given the discuss we had last  e about how much of what was call fiscal s ulus was realli an effect on the  e of busi fix invest spend  it is hard for me to judg the like effect of the chang fiscal outlook   to the extent that there is a fiscal impuls on certain expenditur  i do tend to think of it as onli a  e effect   so the  book may be right   perhap activ from      or      is not go to be pull into the second half of      as much as it otherwis would have been   it   s hard for me to say   but i still think that the basic trend is more like to be stronger rather than weaker   i suppos i wasn   t count on as much from so call fiscal s ulus in the first place  to me an emerg risk that we   re all go to have to think about a bit more   and i certain am tri to understand it a littl better   is what i view as a fallout from the enron debacl   ye day  as you saw  it was announc that got caught up in  the account issu that have emerg of late   that was someth we had been address  of cours  for some week  and we knew that if there was a disclosur  there could be a reaction   if a sequenc of these type of disclosur come out  i think we   re go to have to worri about whether peopl   s general confid in and the qualiti of the earn report we have seen for some  e are as good as we would like to have believ   that has to be bad for the equiti market becaus the risk premium is go to be influenc by that  let me fold in some thought about the nation outlook and what bob   said about mexico   it is true that  when our economi slow  the mexican economi drop as well  howev  that pattern is symmetr   when our economi tend to recov  their will also  i think of it as someth of a slingshot effect   the canadian certain are hope for a slingshot effect if the u s  economi pick up more than had been expect earlier   i view this     trillion economi as a strong locomot which  if it start to perform a littl better  will help pull along not onli mexico and canada but most of asia except for japan   i think those countri are pois to do quit a bit better assum that we also do better   as we shake off pessim in this countri   and that pessim may have been ration but i do think there has been excess caution in the busi sector   i believ those countri will also   the result will be a build momentum of op  that is go to show through in a lot more commerc on a global basi  there is some lag involv  but i do think it   s fair short   my conclus about the risk to the outlook is veri similar to what toni santomero said  so i won   t repeat that
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the second district continu to improv sinc my last report  and inflat has remain neglig   state govern in the district face veri signific budget gap  but they are handl them in my view both respons and well   new york citi  to a larg degre relat to the event of septemb     has a rather signific budget gap for the come fiscal year   but the general feel of the citi is extrem posit  as we continu to recov from septemb    and as the new mayor is off to an extraordinarili posit start   he has been success not onli in attract some unusu good peopl to his administr but also in reach out to minor communiti in a way that has brought to the citi a renew feel of togeth   it seem to be a veri posit begin  retail report better than expect sale in late decemb and earli januari and say  that inventori are lean   privat sector job loss in new york state  new york citi  and new jersey abat notic in decemb   in fact  in the citi we lost        job in octob         in novemb  and onli        in decemb   inde  it look veri much as if the district is not go to have as much of a problem period as it did in the earli     s  when it economi perform much less well than the rest of the countri   rather it seem pois to do at least as well  and perhap even a littl better  than the nation   the offic market in new york citi appear to have improv somewhat in decemb  but the suburban market in the metro area continu to soften   you   ve probabl been read about the announc by some secur firm that they are move their backup site   that was realli anticip  so it   s not particular new news except perhap to the report who broke the stori   on the nation level  we share the view that the economi is alreadi recov and that the inventori correct will return the economi to fair decent growth by midyear   we believ the expans will then continu but at a pace that   s a bit modest  as the  book suggest   on the downsid  let me expand on one risk that has been mention and cite some addit factor that are of concern   the stock market and the yield curv in the bond market clear are forecast a much stronger econom recoveri than ani of us is anticip  with much stronger growth in profit   the equiti market could  as the  book suggest  limp along sideway for a while and then grow   on the other hand  when profit disappoint  as i think they will  we could have an equiti market correct of some signific with a result advers effect on consum confid  in the busi communiti there is such a degre of gloom that  in respons to the clear view of the board of director of the feder reserv bank of new york  we have in fact been recommend a discount rate cut sinc decemb      the onli way i could have avoid that was to tell our director that they should do what i want and not what they want  and i don   t believ that   s what the presid of a reserv bank should be do   to what degre this gloom  could becom a self fulfil propheci is veri  veri difficult to predict   i think what is like to occur is that busi fix invest will come back more slowli than ani of us would like to  see   of cours  as in the santomero jordan view  we could have excess gloom  then a big swing toward a rebirth of op   and then busi fix invest would come back even stronger than we anticip   i believ that the risk are somewhat to the downsid in that i think the economi could experi a recoveri in the middl of the year and then paus   not stall out and go back into recess but look as if it   s not go to pick up further   at that  e  we might be requir to do some addit eas of monetari polici   on the other hand  even though i view toni santomero   s scenario as less probabl  i think it   s entir possibl   therefor  it seem to me that in the monetari polici area we have to be unusu watch and prepar to move in whichev direct appear appropri  if either
thank you  mr  chairman   the list of indic that are begin to show sign of strength is long and get longer   i won   t go through all the upbeat statist  but let me focus on two summari measur   one is what other forecast are say   these forecast can be view as summari of all the lead indic and statist now avail on the economi   i don   t have a complet  e seri  but both the  book and the blue chip forecast have been revis their project upward late  in contrast to last year when revis were sharpli and continu downward   the second is what financi market are say   the staff in it monday brief devis a statist measur that combin lead inform from the stock market  term spread  and the real fed fund rate to measur the probabl of recess   this measur rose sharpli around march of last year  indic recess   it is now drop sharpli  indic that the recess is over  rough replic the behavior of the index in earlier recess   now  i wrote this a day or two ago  and i would add a cautionari note that essenti follow what jerri jordan said a minut ago   if there is what i   ll call an account shock to the stock market  we may have to take that into account in our think in some way   but asid from that caveat  base on this evid and all the other thing we   ve heard this morn  there seem to be far less need for an expansionari monetari polici than there was previous  i also want to focus on a differ side of the question that we haven   t talk about veri much in our meet   it concern what could be call the margin impact of monetari polici  there are two way to think about this margin impact   one is what i   ll call the orthodox approach  and the second is what i   ll call the regress to the mean approach   in the orthodox approach  a drop in short term interest rate lower long term interest rate and rais consumpt and invest   model use this approach   our own frb us model  sn   t realli use this approach   are usual complic and not strict linear   but the impact of monetari expans is approxim linear   that is  the impact on consumpt and invest is rough the same when the fund rate is  say    percent as when it is   percent   by contrast  in the regress to the mean approach  long rate stay within their histor band   long rate averag expect futur short rate over a long period of  e  and it is natur that  when bond dealer form long term expect  there is a strong adapt compon   in this sens  when short rate get well outsid their histor rang  it becom progress harder to budg long rate   in this approach  the margin impact of chang in short rate could be much less when short rate are   percent than when they are   percent  the logic is essenti the same as with the zero bound liquid trap argument except that the motiv factor is not so much the zero bound as such but a comparison of long rate to their histor rang   it   s not hard to figur out where i   m go with this   we just may be get to the rang where further reduct in the fund rate will not have that much impact on long rate and on the real economi   and this point is magnifi by anoth factor that is contrari to what most textbook have these day  as ampli discuss in the reifschneid   paper   at least for the unit state right now  rate reduct are unlik to rais net export  one of the import channel of monetari polici   the effect of overal econom strength  good policymak  and other factor seem clear to domin the mundel fleme mechan  wherebi easier monetari polici lower the currenc valu and s ul net export   the combin of less need for monetari expans and  if true  the declin margin impact of monetari expans mean that we may have hit a cross point   for most of last year  the need for expansionari polici was clear  and polici eas was presum to be effect   then the choic was relat noncontroversi   now the need is dubious  as is the effect  and there is a much stronger case for stand pat
thank you  mr  chairman   as other have alreadi said  the recent indic have on balanc been more posit than one might have fear at the last meet  and they are broad consist with recoveri start befor long   unlik governor    i   m not go to put much weight on the consensus forecast becaus  while it is obvious meant to be a compendium of a larg number of forecast  i   m not so sure the forecast have gotten it right thus far  actual  i would put more weight on some of the incom data  particular in my case on the new order for capit good   given the natur of this slowdown  the place where i thought i   d first look to see if there   s ani turn is in that area   and inde new order for capit good did firm in the latter part of       especi for comput and semiconductor   in addit  there   s a varieti of survey data that other have talk about  which i think might be indic of a turn  as well as the initi claim data   moreov  there are some forc that will be at work to give a lift to the economi in the month ahead   inventori liquid has been brisk over the past year or so  and the acceler relationship bode well for recoveri in busi  invest onc firm see final demand stabil and turn up   in addit  i take some comfort from the fact that return on invest in tech good outsid the telecom sector appear to have remain high  which should bol  invest and continu to keep labor product grow relat strong  have said all that  i think the major polici issu here realli has to do with the so call  balanc of risk   there are two way one can look at that   one involv the risk of some surpris that throw us off the baselin forecast   in that regard i think a number of forc are restrain the economi and creat some downsid risk   i   d like to pick up on one that jerri jordan and ned   touch on  which strike me as veri import   the most recent profit report have been rough in line with expect or even a littl better  but profit continu to fall relat sharpli last quarter   moreov  the scope for improv profit will like be affect by a limit abil to rais price at a  e of ongo competit pressur  the equiti market do seem to continu to incorpor a fair sharp turnaround in profit in        that could  if it fail to materi  send stock price lower and advers affect both busi and household spend   i would add to this the point that jerri jordan made  which is that the so call enron effect or account effect creat some greater uncertainti  which again add to the potenti downsid risk there  there are other kind of risk that one might point to   declin in energi cost have been support consumpt and busi profit in the aggreg   but as i recal from the chart show ye day  it seem as though go forward energi price have onli a littl more room to declin in a lag respons to the previous drop in the price of oil   the wealth effect that we   ve talk about is probabl still main negat  with more drag on household spend to play out  final  there   s the entir question of the interplay of the asset and liabil side of the balanc sheet with respect to both household and busi   if profit remain weak  if unemploy continu to pick up  and if the abil to increas compens remain in ani sens constrain  there   s a possibl   in a context where both household and busi have taken on a lot of debt in recent year   that debt servic burden may becom increas oner   i   m not suggest that this will necessarili play out in the way that the newspap or magazin portray it  but there is still a possibl that debt servic burden will exert downward weight  if you will  on household and busi   so from that standpoint  i believ the risk are primarili to the downsid  one way to think about our polici decis   and no one has rais it thus far   is that we have a dual mandat   the fact that inflat appear to be under control current and is like to remain under control give us a littl more scope to look at the other side of the mandat   to fo  maximum sustain growth   here i   d like to point out that in the staff project the output gap is persist and posit dure the entir forecast period   if one is to believ the staff forecast or other  we will have an output gap for the next eight quarter that goe from  about     percent of gdp down to about   percent of gdp   one might argu   and this might be consist with what cathi   was say earlier   that in that environ the easier  monetari polici scenario in the  book  which suggest a bit more eas and is similar to the    inflat cushion    scenario in the bluebook  might not be total inappropri   again  that   s contrari to what ned   just said  and i   m not sure my posit necessarili is one of strong recommend further eas   but i   d like to leav that possibl on the tabl becaus we do have a forecast scenario in which there are a varieti of downsid risk   moreov  even if the baselin forecast materi  it will mean a veri weak recoveri with a persist posit output gap   and i think we should not let the second half of our mandat go unheed in a period when inflat and inflationari pressur seem well contain   thank you  mr  chairman
short after the last meet i heard two major retail banker   one on the east coast at the boston fed board meet and then a coupl of day later one on the west coast   describ their loan portfolio with surpris op   both in term of loan perform and of loan demand   given that so much of our focus at the last meet   and it   s the case again today   was on the question of the resili of the consum  i   ve inform survey about a dozen other bank and one financ compani as to what their experi has been on the consum side   i have a coupl of observ to report  first of all   and i corrobor this with our own number from call report data    thirti  and nineti day delinqu at the end of the third quarter of      were rough the same as in      and        although charg off were up slight  one institut account for a signific number of those   in each case  i would say that the contact i talk with express op  and they said that loan perform was posit veri much across the line with the except of the subprim market   both in automobil and in real estat the subprim market is weak   one factor that may be have an impact there is that we are get veri close again  for at least the third or fourth consecut year  to have bankruptci reform legisl   and each  e we do  we get an upturn in the number of bankruptci file  which particular affect the  subprim marketplac   in term of product  the growth product for consum loan portfolio has been the home equiti line of credit  almost across the board among bank   and banker are hope that they can resum auto lend  with the automobil industri chang it incent from the zero percent financ immedi follow septemb   to the rebat in        but the real increas  of cours  has been in the refinanc of real estat   that has had two interest  effect   one  it cut off the growth in home equiti line of credit becaus a homeown cannot withdraw his home equiti by refinanc and also commit it to secur a line of credit   they are mutual exclus   but becaus there have been a lot of refinanc  either for purpos of debt consolid or to obtain a lower interest rate  we have the seem contradict of growth in the consum loan portfolio actual free up fund for discretionari spend becaus of the reduct in overal debt payment   in sum  the consum sector has clear outperform expect to this point from a year ago   the movement in retail credit portfolio has support discretionari spend   but lender are cautious   they are awar that unemploy has not peak and that loan perform on the consum side will lag  so they do expect to see some further weak in come month   in general  i don   t hear anybodi describ consum sen ent as buoyant  their assess is more cautious   i would say that their evalu of the consum   s abil to particip  either at current or slight higher level  is neutral or mayb just slight abov neutral
mani of the comment i had put togeth we   ve alreadi focus on  but let me summar the issu i   ve been look at   first  on the inflat front   after today   s number particular   i continu to be quit surpris by how littl evid there is of price increas   the fact that we actual had a fall in nomin gdp in the quarter is unusu  over a period of a coupl of decad anyway   it lead me to be concern about what is go to happen to gross corpor earn in the come year   to get the pe ratio that the market is price in   to get to those doubl digit earn increas   would impli huge increas in unit  sale in the context of a lack of price power   so  i share some of the concern state earlier about the abil of compani to generat that quick the earn turnaround impli in current pe ratio  this recess  as we   ve discuss  has been shallow in larg part becaus consum continu to spend throughout the whole recessionari period   one can look at the event of septemb    as a shock that produc someth of a cocoon effect   peopl didn   t go anywher and didn   t buy anyth for a few month   we   re now see consum confid back to the level that prevail befor the septemb    event   and to the extent that consum can just hold the cours for the next few month  i think we have a strong base and i believ that we have turn the corner on econom activ  the rapid liquid of inventori by busi in the fourth quarter is anoth sign that inventori are close to the level compani will need to have  even though the small busi survey  as i read the number  indic that those firm still plan to cut inventori in the first quarter   moreov  as governor   note  the good news is on the busi invest front as a whole  sinc that is what got us into this recess   the fact that new order for comput and peripher equip have grown for three month suggest that we probabl have hit the bottom on that   even small busi  while still intend to liquid inventori  now indic that they actual are look at plan to increas their capit invest expenditur   sinc i believ small busi have been critic in creat job growth in this countri  i see that as the start point for get us back to a fa  pace of growth  let me note two area i am concern about   one was mention quit a bit in the various district report  and that is the problem that state and local govern are face  mani state and local govern are run out of their raini day fund   sever are under sever stress   mani that had unemploy reserv are not go to have much left  bar ani addit assist that come from the feder govern  and that is alreadi show up in layoff and reduc support for local servic in a lot of area   these reserv were  accumul for the purpos of help the peopl who have probabl lost their job   so i am concern about the effect and the potenti drag on econom activ from the state and local sector  whether it   s in construct or employ more general  i also share the concern that sever have mention about confid in the capit market due to the enron scandal and other recent account restat   i think the nois is go to get even wors  given that some of the earn boost this year is due to chang in good will account  those chang effect stop amort and give a one  e uptick to  state earn   but it realli isn   t earn  it   s just anoth account chang   i also worri that if compani are forc to bring joint ventur back into their consolid statement  they may be bring them back on the book just at the point when the joint ventur are go from  loss to profit  and that may make the earn pictur cloudi   it will further reduc confid in the qualiti of the account standard in this countri   on balanc  i believ that the economi has turn   i see neither risk of inflat nor risk of deflat   the forecast in the  book is close to what i would project  but i am more pessimist about compani rehir worker   i think that will occur much more slowli than is forecast in the  book
thank you veri much   coffe is avail in the next  room   shall we take a break   coffe break
mr  kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   increas sign of stabil in demand and product lend credibl to a forecast that the economi is in the process of turn up  potenti lead to a resumpt of sustain econom growth   the better news of the last few month suggest that the major forc that have been depress final demand over the last year or so are abat and their further effect will be limit  even though they have not yet complet play themselv out   for exampl  although previous declin in equiti price will continu to restrain consumpt  the net rebound of equiti market in recent month  if not revers  should limit the extent of the negat wealth effect   in the busi sector  the firm in order for capit good help to support an assess of good progress in work down the overhang  and the persist of product gain suggest strong incent for capit invest go forward   the terrorist attack have left littl last imprint on consum confid  and oversea  economi also show some sign of stabil and have been resili to contagion from argentina   but while this evid on demand and asset price provid some comfort that the recess will be shallow and end soon  it leav consider margin of doubt about the strength of the recoveri   the forecast of the staff and fomc member for      is that the pickup will be moder  consist with some further slacken in resourc util in the near term   in the staff forecast  the output gap close slowli in the second half of      and in        as suggest by the staff memo on monetari polici effect  the natur of the shock of the past year   by lower expect profit  rais risk premium  and affect economi oversea   has led to asset price movement that impli that the gap between the fund rate and it equilibrium level signific overst the degre of demand s ulus embed in financi market   that is  owe to a higher cost of equiti capit  lower wealth  a stronger dollar  and elev risk premium in credit market  the monetari polici pipelin is not as full as might be suppos   and these more advers financi condit may unwind onli gradual in the recoveri   pressur on profit and cash flow in come quarter could well damp increas in equiti price and reduct in risk premium  as well as hold down growth in invest more direct   moreov  as dave   point out ye day  becaus household spend has been so well maintain  the releas of pent up demand for durabl and a ralli in residenti construct that histor have account for some of the vigor of recoveri are not like to be present this  e around   as could be seen in the extend baselin in the bluebook  the continu restraint on demand in the staff forecast mean that the degre of eas in the stanc of polici must be revers onli gradual to permit the economi to return to it potenti   in fact  an outlook like that in the staff forecast could be seen as provid support for anoth modest polici eas   with the feder fund rate held at it current level through most of this year  substanti output gap persist over the next two year  and inflat come down appreci further   eas polici anoth notch would promot growth while allow some  more limit  further declin in inflat   inde  the rate of inflat forecast in the  book for      is quit low   in the zone the reifschneid   brief ye day identifi as elev the odd on polici be constrain by the zero nomin bound   if the economi were to be hit with major downward shock over the next few year  the scope for achiev negat real interest rate to counter the effect of those shock would be narrow   sinc it   s not difficult to conjur up a number of candid for such advers develop  the committe might feel more comfort if the economi were stronger and inflat a littl higher over the period in which those shock might occur so that real short term rate could be lower in the futur  if necessari   in this context  a further reduct in rate today could be seen as    insur     though against the possibl of a futur advers surpris requir a substanti monetari polici respons rather than against a possibl near term shortfal in the economi stem from recent develop   but the recent more upbeat data also make it more like that polici may alreadi be posit to support a suffici robust expans to provid a margin of safeti against advers shock   and these data increas the odd that a further eas would risk polici overshoot   of fo  a rebound in demand that could be difficult to contain   keep polici unchang at this meet would allow the committe to assess better the like strength of demand and it respons to it previous eas action  a consider portion of which was undertaken in the last few month   those action were taken part in anticip of a period of further weak in econom activ and declin in resourc util and were influenc as well by an assess of substanti downsid risk in the forecast   in the event  the outcom perhap has been a littl better than mani of you probabl expect after the terrorist attack  and the odd on even more advers outcom from the forc that have been bear down on the economi have diminish consider   inde  the posit cast to the data may suggest increas chanc that the economi could continu to come in stronger than forecast  better balanc the consider remain downsid risk   if firm have been calibr their reduct in inventori  invest spend  and labor forc to the possibl of veri weak outcom  the persist strength in consumpt could spark a reason robust rebound in busi spend   moreov  the current veri easi stanc of polici as measur by short term interest rate itself provid some cushion against downsid econom risk   the gap between market and economist evalu of the most like strength of the recoveri has narrow over the intermeet period  but it remain wide  and the yield curv retain a steep upward slope  should incom data point to a weaker recoveri than is implicit in current market price  a fund rate of    percent leav consider scope for intermedi term and long term market interest rate to work lower  which could lend support to the economi while the committe evalu the need for further polici action   although the committe may see the risk around the type of rebound in the staff forecast as now better balanc  they may still be weight to the downsid  and the forecast itself suggest unbalanc outcom  at least for a  e   with growth in output remain below that of potenti for a while and inflat on a downward trajectori through the forecast interv  your goal of maximum sustain growth would seem to continu to be at greater risk than your object of keep inflat low   the declin in inflat  by itself  will tend to increas the real feder fund rate   the messag of an announc of unbalanc risk and an unchang fund rate target would be that on balanc you were still more concern about subpar growth than about rise inflat but your concern had diminish consider   in the current circumst  with inflat like to be fall  a judgment that the risk were balanc would seem to requir some confid that final demand were strengthen enough  and the recoveri had taken hold suffici  to promis sustain growth abov the trend of potenti at the current stanc of polici   such growth is need to reduc the output gap and eventu put a floor on the rate of inflat   financi market particip appar expect the economi to be suffici strong to put high odd on substanti tighten begin this summer   if you share their outlook  you probabl should adopt an assess of balanc risk at this meet   under condit of the staff forecast  howev  it is not until late this year that the committe need to begin move the feder fund rate more activ back toward a neutral stanc in order to forestal the economi later overshoot the level of it potenti   you may consid even that delay tighten as prematur if you are concern about low rate of inflat and resourc util in        despit the expect embed in interest rate  most market observ anticip that you will retain the current balanc of risk assess at this meet  perhap on the way to balanc risk at the next meet or so  and market reaction to such an announc should be minim   your impli doubt about the strength of the recoveri might lower long term rate a littl further  but if the stanc of polici is kept unchang at this meet  market are unlik to build in expect of addit near term polici eas unless the inform becom avail over come week turn unexpect weak
are there question for don
yes  i have a comment more than a question   i found chart   in the bluebook on altern strategi for monetari polici quit interest   to me it seem to highlight the import point that inflat has gotten low enough that the particular inflat goal matter for near term polici decis   in addit  the inflat goal has becom import in the context of the discuss that we had ye day regard the zero bound on nomin short term interest rate   in my view these consider call for some further committe discuss at some point  perhap at the june meet  about the desir steadi state rate of inflat
don  you refer to the framework reflect in chart    which depict the current fed fund rate versus various es  of the equilibrium real fed fund rate   i find this a use framework even though i do have problem with the use of a lag pce as a proxi for inflat expect   nevertheless  you cite a number of reason whi  in the current situat  the fund rate may not be as s ul as it appear   given that  let   s say you superimpos on that chart the relationship of the nomin fund rate to other market rate   the spread of the two year  five year  and ten year rate over the fund rate   if those spread are wider  would you character that as more s ul or the same amount of s ulus for a given nomin or real fed fund rate
i would character that as market believ that the current nomin fund rate is quit s ul and like to result in fair vigor growth befor too long and  therefor  they expect the fund rate to have to rise   to me that would indic that market are op ist  as reflect in the yield curv and as reflect in the equiti market   it say that financi market particip are more op ist than the board staff   or i think than mani of you  judg from your forecast submit for this meet   i don   t know that it indic relat to your own forecast that polici is s ul   i think it indic that the market believ polici is s ul  howev
further question for don   presid
don  also on chart    i was curious about the project of the  unemploy rate in the price stabil scenario   i realiz  obvious  that these are long term project  but when the forecast is run out to      the unemploy rate is still signific abov the nairu at that point   i was just wonder how this model work   when would you  expect the unemploy rate to start come down closer to the nairu
i think it would be come down over subsequ year   as we get to      and       the real feder fund rate is about at it equilibrium   when it   s at it equilibrium  the economi should come to it equilibrium   so  converg to the nairu would be occur  it   s just a question of how fast it would happen   the dynam of this are such that  in order to make it happen fa   you could have a somewhat lower real feder fund rate  obvious  for a   e and then come up to the equilibrium later   but the way this model is construct  converg will happen gradual as the economi come to it equilibrium
so it would happen but beyond the       efram
not to prolong this discuss too much  but follow up on the last coupl of commentari  i want to rais a concern   i   ve never been one to think that have a number that we agre is our inflat target   or certain that public such a number   is a good thing   but i must say that these chart rais that issu  particular when as in chart   price stabil is defin as    percent  measur by core pce  and that chart suggest that it take three to five year to get there   grant  who can realli reli on the result of a model when one is project out that far   still  use that framework for think about this issu is a littl disturb  given the amount of resourc slack that is embed in that kind of price stabil number   i   m not sure i want to go in bob   s direct  but i must say that these chart are a littl troubl to me
i think an interest  almost extraordinari point here is that this  committe face a problem that no fomc has face in year   what is it  near forti year  mani of you   and some peopl who aren   t here and depart recent   use to say that it would take just one recess to get back to price stabil   we had that recess plus a nice burst of product growth  and inflat is in the neighborhood of price stabil   the committe for the last twenti year realli has not worri about how low inflat should go  but now you have someth new to factor into your think about monetari polici   that  sn   t necessarili mean that you need to vote on what that number is and publish the number  but it   mean  as you   re think about your polici choic  that you need to keep in mind that it is possibl for inflat to go too low   actual  i think it   s a compliment to the committe that you   ve gotten to that point over the last twenti year
that   s exact the point i was tri to make in say that we need further committe discuss of this
mayb we ought to enjoy it instead of worri too much about it   laughter
yes  whi  sn   t it feel enjoy
well  those are your central banker credenti at work    laughter
our job is to worri about everyth   good news is good and bad
further question for don   if not  let me get start   i  don   t have much to add to what has been said  but there is an issu that i think requir some attent  earlier today  dave   rais the question of a potenti intern inconsist in the forecast  which stipul that profit margin will remain flat at a veri low level but also assum that the stock market hold up  the wealth effect   what it    and the demand for capit good start to come back  there also is a question as to whether the lower portion of chart   from ye day   s present  which depict nonfinanci corpor profit share over the last twenti year  depict the true under profit potenti   current and project profit share are shown in the  chart as be below those of      and even those of        in construct the nation incom account  bea includ stock option realiz in the wage and salari compon of the account but larg exclud the capit gain of compani that may offset those cost   the reason is that  by definit  capit gain are strip out of the nation incom account  howev  one should serious question whether includ the realiz capit gain on  compani issu stock option in employe compens while exclud capit gain from compani profit constitut    singl entri bookkeep      inde  if the capit gain on the exercis of option were to be includ in compani incom  the profit share would be boost by a suffici larg amount to bring it back to      level at least  nonetheless  the declin in that profit share ratio  even after take appropri account of both side of firm    book  is still veri pronounc  and it rais some interest question as to whi the forecast recoveri is so tepid   the reason sure is that we had a     percent annual product growth rate in the fourth quarter at what might have been the bottom of this cycl  the usual expans in profit margin come off of the bottom of a busi cycl typic is boost by a turnaround from negat to posit output per hour   howev  unless somebodi want to come out and forecast a   percent annual product growth rate  it   s hard to make that project this  e around   as a consequ we   ve got a veri t i problem becaus i would ventur to say that  if inde this is the correct profit margin forecast  then clear the impli stock market valuat in the  book is just not right  as   has argu  these number  especi down at these level  are quit sensit to veri small chang in big aggreg total like employe compens   consequ  if the slowdown in the rate of increas in compens were to be a littl larger than expect or the rate of price disinfl is not as oner as is impli in the  book  then we   re talk about a   percent profit margin   and when the other aggreg involv are veri larg  small chang in the element of unit labor cost  or even in corpor energi cost  can have signific effect on the profit margin  the problem is that the  book inde may have it right  and the slow of the econom recoveri that effect reflect this in an interact way suggest that what remain an open question is whether final demand realli is go to pick up when the inventori runoff start to abat   this lead to an ever increas need  i should think  for a standard old fashion keynesian multipli effect come from the swing of inventori spill over into dispos incom and creat a level of final demand beyond what   s implicit in the  book   but while this may seem like a standard recoveri out of a post world war ii recess  there is an anomali here becaus  as has been comment on befor  gdp hasn   t gone down veri much   inde  as of this morn   s releas  it went down even less than we thought   moreov  the upsid momentum from the multipli kick  which has been one of the factor that has given us a   percent increas in the first four quarter of earlier recoveri    not show up in these data  inde  it may not be there in realiti  which would say that this is a differ type of recoveri  as a consequ  the general notion of keep the balanc of risk toward weak in fact reflect what is obvious the state of play at this  e   nonetheless  the degre of inventori liquid that has taken place has been so larg and pervas that it will help support the economi  if onli becaus as we   ve discuss previous one of the veri few thing we know about econom forecast is that inventori cannot go below zero   so  if they are be liquid at a veri rapid rate and the level of inventori is move toward zero  of necess the rate of liquid must slow irrespect of anybodi   s state of confid  wish  hope  or fear   and if that   happen  unless consumpt fall off veri dramat  product has to rise to meet consumpt  this is one of the veri rare phenomena that one can employ with certainti in econom forecast   there are few other that can provid the high degre of probabl that this has  and the liquid we have seen is bigger than we   ve ever seen it   the troubl is  what happen in the spring or summer when it   s over   i would scarc want to argu that the horizon for our balanc of risk statement is realli focus on a period six month from now   so in a certain sens there is an argument  to which at the moment i   m not subscrib  that we ought to go to a neutral balanc of risk as well as hold the fund rate unchang  the difficulti is that this institut   s credibl has gotten to a point where what happen in the marketplac reflect not onli the market   s expect of what we are do to the fund rate but also what the market believ our econom outlook is   consequ  if we make no chang in the fund rate today  which is what i recommend  and on top of that we were to move to a statement that the risk are balanc  the market would chang   long term interest rate would rise   and i submit to you that as of tomorrow morn the market would essenti be reflect of an environ in which the balanc of risk should be negat becaus the rise in long term interest rate would alter the general outlook   so in our meet we are requir to evalu not onli the balanc of risk but also what our statement about the risk will do to the outlook  which feed back on our assess of what the balanc of risk is   as a result  i would prefer to stay with the balanc of risk toward weak and leav the fund rate unchang  and have listen to the convers around this tabl  i suspect that general is where most of us are   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i support your recommend
thank you   vice chair
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  let me just add a comment sinc i   m suppos to know someth about market   i think that the market reaction to our go to a balanc risk statement would be formid danger  and  therefor  i believ it is especi import that we follow your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend on the fund rate   i would have prefer a move to a balanc risk statement   let me just comment briefli about our situat look ahead   take the  book forecast as a baselin   and in my view it   s a veri reason baselin   i think our polici option this year are go to be relat straightforward if the outcom approxim that baselin   we   re go to keep the fund rate about where it is or nudg it up along the way   the polici decis will be relat uncompl   a number of peopl have talk about the downsid risk  and i attach posit probabl to all the risk that peopl have mention   if in fact the economi come out signific on that negat side of the baselin  then i think our situat will be less comfort but actual still rather straightforward   the fund rate will either stay the same  or we   ll be shade it down   that   s about all we can do under those circumst  i   d like to comment veri briefli  though  on what would happen if the outcom were on the high side of the  book forecast   there is a distribut around that outcom   i   d note  of cours  that the economi is veri  veri liquid   money growth has been veri high  and i think it is not by ani mean beyond the realm of possibl that we could see some quarter where real gdp growth is in the   to   percent real growth rang   that   s a fair easi number to get to for a coupl of quarter if consumpt demand remain around   percent  busi invest tend to level off  and we get an inventori surg   if that happen  then the issu go forward is go to be how sustain that growth is like to be  and we   re go to have a much more difficult job of manag expect   i think what will happen under that set of circumst is that  as soon as we start to rais the fund rate  the market is go to project more fund rate increas to come   as a consequ  it will be a t i task to manag expect correct so that the market  sn   t overshoot a sensibl respons   thank you
presid  n
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  includ the balanc of risk statement  although it seem to me that most of the  e at the trough or veri earli in an expans that   s almost state the obvious in term of where the risk lie   let me make a comment on one other thing   i certain don   t know how the profit pictur is go to play out  but the  book   have rather modest product gain over the next sever quarter   if we get just a percentag point or so better than that  that may not be great for labor market condit but it may show up in improv profit margin  other thing be equal   and i can easili imagin that occur
you know  if we cyclic adjust it  the     percent product growth figur is a rather larger number than ani of us would believ
oh  cyclic adjust that   s a remark number   but if we look at the  book number go forward from this point  they are still rather modest
that   s true enough   presid jordan
thank you   i thought your analysi of the profit situat was veri interest  and i   d like to understand it better   so mayb in the futur the staff could illustr for us how sensit these number are to chang in the assumpt about such thing as product   i would also includ an analysi of other factor  such as the repatri of earn under altern assumpt in a global marketplac   as for the polici action this  e  i have no problem at all with stay at the current fund rate   on the risk statement  i agre that chang it is a riski thing to do onc we alreadi have a statement in place   it is the chang that bother me  and i want to be cautious about do that   at the decemb meet i would have been veri happi to leav the fund rate target where it was  and if the consensus was to have the balanc of risk on the downsid  that would have been okay   but my second choic would have been to cut the rate  as was done in decemb  and to go to a statement say that the risk were balanc   had we done that  i can   t see that anyth we heard here today would lead peopl to say that now the risk on the downsid are greater than they were in decemb  that wasn   t the tone here at all   but what troubl me most about the risk statement is how it   s interpret by the market and the public   and the truth is that i don   t know   the word    weak     sn   t mean weaken or declin   if it mean weak as in not robust  that   s one thing   but none of us is say that we think the downsid risk are such that we could see declin in econom activ from this point on  we   re simpli say that we expect not veri vigor growth   so i think we   re stuck with the same balanc of risk toward weak  and all i can hope is that in remark and tes oni it is explain as say that we   re expect growth but not veri vigor growth
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend
mr  chairman  i support both part also   let me say two thing   on  the balanc of risk  if the scenario that mani of us have in mind pan out  we will have a lot of  e to move to chang the risk statement from weight toward weak to balanc   i don   t think we have to do it today   there   s go to be  e   this is the way we   ve act in the past  we   ve turn polici around slowli   so i   m veri comfort with stand pat on the rate and keep the negat balanc statement   perhap if we were to chang an adject or two in the statement  that might help  let me also go back to an issu that both cathi and roger rais in the earlier go around  look out a bit in  e  as in the bluebook simul  would we prefer a combin of   percent unemploy and   percent inflat or     percent unemploy and     percent inflat   they indic that they might well prefer the latter choic  and i might too   but i don   t think we have to make that decis now   even though this is not the way the simul was frame  i think that   s a question that will confront us in the futur as we face the issu of how fast we come back to equilibrium   i think that   s a good question  but it   s a question for anoth day
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both halv of your recommend   i will say that  as i listen to don kohn   s present  my earlier statement indic that i could imagin even support a cut in the fund rate today was in some sens reinforc   i know don was tri to give both side of the argument   he did a great job   and i do think there are some credibl argument for say that we realli should keep the possibl of a reduct in the fund rate on the tabl   therefor  i also was pleas to hear what governor   had to say about this be an issu for a futur day   it is just not clear to me that we are do everyth we should be do if we are go to toler unemploy that appear like to be at or near   percent for as long as the forecast allow us to see the futur   that is abov anyon   s es  of the nairu   even peopl who recent left the committe  i think  would not accept that the nairu is that high   it   s not quit clear what price inflat or price  stabil should be  but it  sn   t strike me that     or    percent is total unaccept and mean that we have fail   but for today  i will certain support your recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   in my statement i talk about the risk on both side   but i do think the two key risk  which we all talk about   capit spend and the consum   are truli weight to the downsid   a lot can alway go wrong on the consum side   so i support both part of the recommend
mr  chairman  i support your recommend with regard to the rate  and i certain would defer to you and vice chairman   in term of the market effect of chang the balanc of risk statement   howev  it  sn   t appear to me that the risk are now primarili in the direct of generat econom weak   to me  at least  the risk actual appear balanc
i support your recommend on both part  mr  chairman   i believ a more measur approach to monetari polici is appropri today   i think we should let the polici s ulus current in the pipelin work through the economi  and in my view a paus would be a good idea   moreov  the groundwork has alreadi been laid so that the market and the public will not be surpris if we leav rate unchang   inde  i think they would be  comfort by that decis  as it would reinforc their view of the recoveri without make them euphor and then get into the feedback problem to which you allud  and i think that   s an import thing to consid   so i fulli support your propos
i fulli support both part of your recommend  mr  chairman   i guess i was a bit attract to don   s definit  if you will  of what constitut econom weak in the sens of excess capac in the system   and i think that   s what we are look at   it   s not that excess capac will be increas  obvious it will diminish over the next year or so   but it seem to me that  when we think about the context of risk at a particular  e  we have to be look at risk within at most a year   s  e frame and no more than that   over that  e frame of a year i think econom activ is go to be weaker than we would like it to be
i fulli support both part of your recommend  mr  chairman   if i may  i   d like to make an observ about the comment of bob and cathi and other regard the longer term simul   i hope we don   t get too uncomfort too fast with the price stabil we   ve spent twenti year tri to achiev    laughter   in that context i would just point out that i have great respect for the simul  but there   s a huge confid interv around those simul when one is look three or four year down the road   also with respect to the zero bound  if we   ve achiev price stabil  we have high credibl  and we   re go to have to live with that threat of approach the zero bound   to me  one of the thing that came out of marvin   s present ye day was that it made me op ist that we can studi the issu further and becom more comfort with idea on how we can deal with it   so befor we make ani decis along those line  i think we need to studi it further and talk about it further
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   i  too  was struck by some of don kohn   s comment on definit of weak   i hope there is some way that we can signal that we   re talk about growth in the economi be signific below what we consid to be  it potenti   i don   t want peopl to infer from the risk statement that we   re expect a doubl dip recess to come along   so if there   s a way that we can make that clear in the word of our statement  i would be more comfort with it
i support your recommend   i support the part on the no chang in the rate enthusiast but on the bias somewhat reluct   it is liter true  as you point out in the first half of your discuss  that the balanc of risk is more toward weak than inflat   and that is the other side of the coin   but given the lag in the effect of the rate cut alreadi built in  it seem to me that some languag could be put into the press releas indic that for polici purpos we think the risk  look forward  are go to be balanc   part two of your discuss remind me that i don   t think we   re do ourselv a servic by vote on a bias at these meet   i think we   d be better off if we just vote on the rate  did not vote on the bias  and therefor did not have a bias to announc   pretti soon we   re go to have to get into the area of game theori to figur out the dynam
we   re alreadi there    laughter
so i continu to hope that someday we   ll be abl to get off that tiger
i support the recommend  both part
a major of the vote member appear to be in favor of hold the rate where it is and maintain the balanc of risk toward weak   would you  read the appropri direct languag
this is from page    in the bluebook      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around    percent      with regard to the balanc of risk  the sentenc read     against the background of it long run goal of price stabil and sustain econom growth and of the inform current avail  the committe believ that the risk continu to be weight main toward condit that may generat econom weak in the forese futur

would you circul the draft statement    paus  yes  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye  ye   comment   presid pool
i would suggest that we chang    busi spend    to    busi fix  invest    sinc we   ve agre that the inventori part of spend might be dramat in the other direct
that   s an excel suggest   can we do that   let   s write in    busi fix invest
mr  chairman  i don   t have ani big ax to grind  but my view is that the averag american think of    busi spend    as busi spend and that    busi fix invest    is more the jargon of economist and market type   i think the term    busi spend    actual is better at explain to real peopl what we   re talk about   sever   how about    capit spend
that   s fine
in other word     household and busi capit  spend
yes  someth like that
is that accept to you
anybodi els have ani comment   if not  i   ll assum that is accept   now we have the final item on our agenda  and i will turn the floor over to governor   to lead the discuss
thank you veri much   this item involv anoth step on our journey toward greater transpar  which we start sever year ago   the issu were rais in a memo that was distribut date januari      i   d like to put to the committe three question  which are interrel   one is  should we disclos the exist of dissent   the talli of the vote on the target feder fund rate  if you will   after each meet   the second question is  if so  what should we disclos   on this question there are a number of option   we could disclos just the vote itself   that the vote was unanim or was    for and   against  for exampl   altern  we could disclos the talli of the vote and the name of dissent  if ani   the third question  which is relat to the first two  is  how should we make this disclosur   that obvious goe to the question of disclos this inform short after the meet   should we includ it in the statement releas after each meet  or should we have our public affair staff disclos the talli and the name or name of ani dissent in respons to question from the press   our public affair peopl talk to the press at about      p m  or so to releas the statement  my recommend on this matter was a close call in some way  and in my memo i tri to lay out the argument on both side   i   ll just review them veri briefli   a number of reason exist in favor of disclos the talli  and possibl the name of ani dissent  around the same  e that we releas the press statement after the meet   first  the inform may be relev to the market in fulli understand our polici decis   when the exist of dissent come out current  it is certain note in the press and perhap  though it   s hard to say  by certain market particip   second  the absenc of ani disclosur of the vote immedi follow a meet has recent led both market particip and journalist  on occas  to use a proxi to tri to determin whether or not there were ani dissent   and the proxi they seem to be use has been the number of reserv bank request a chang in the discount rate   that proxi some  is accur  and some  it is not   the third reason for disclos the exist of dissent and the name of the dissent is that we current follow that practic with respect to the vote taken by the board of governor on discount rate action  we do inde disclos the vote talli  and in the past when there were dissent  the name of the dissent   so this would be conform the practic for fomc vote to the practic that we current use with respect to the vote taken by the board on discount rate chang   also  other central bank do disclos their vote  and as far as i can tell from talk to them  that turn out not to have been veri disturb or disori to market  addit  we believ that our press offic would be oblig to disclos the talli and the name of ani dissent in respons to a direct question from the press   to date there have been no direct question  but there is certain a risk that someon who is either well vers on freedom of inform issu or new to the press scene will ask a direct question and will get this inform   that would leav us in the moder awkward posit of tri to explain whi we hadn   t disclos that type of inform earlier   final  anoth argument in favor of make this disclosur at the same  e that we releas the press statement is that the committe clear is will to let the market know about dissent becaus we put that inform into the minut   so it   s simpli a question of  e  now let me go to the argument against do this
may i interrupt for just a second
i think you ought to point out that our general counsel think our legal requir to releas this inform is unambigu
yes  he     i   m look to see if   mat is here  sever   he   s behind you
yes  that   s the reason i rais the point     has told me that current the situat is as follow   the first  e someon ask for this inform  the press offic could say that a foia request would have to be file   but the second  e anyon ask  the question direct  we would be oblig to releas the inform   so our room for maneuv  if you will  is somewhat more constrain than one might have thought earlier
whi is that   whi would we be oblig to releas it immedi at the  e of the second request
will you speak to that
there is a provis in foia that onc an agenc has disclos a particular kind of inform then that inform has to be made avail to the public immedi upon request
yes  thereaft   the act cannot be use to put peopl through the foia process for obtain inform when that inform has alreadi been determin to be public   there is a specif provis that say that  onc an agenc has act on a request for a particular type of inform  the agenc has to make it avail if there is reason to believ that other would be interest in that or similar inform
suppos we argu that it is detriment to our policymak process to do this and we take this issu to court   is there ani conceiv  scenario that you can think of in which we would prevail
no   we had the abil to prevail until the committe chang it practic with regard to the releas of it polici decis   onc you releas the decis you must releas the vote
my understand is that onc we decid in      to announc ani chang in the target feder fund rate short after our meet  it brought this entir foia mechan into play   so  in respons to a question we have to releas the vote talli and how each individu vote
and how  e this is done  sn   t enter into the equat   we can   t say that we will releas the inform but onli at a point in  e when it would tend not to be detriment to our immedi oper
well  i don   t see how we could   we would have to show that to releas it befor the minut are releas is go to caus the govern financi harm
financi harm is the issu
right   the reason we didn   t have to releas the direct befor      was that we argu  and prevail  that we couldn   t releas the direct befor the desk fulli implement the fomc   s decis becaus it would caus the govern financi harm  whether that was right or wrong  that   s what we argu  and the court agre to it   in       when we initi the practic of make the polici decis public  we abandon that argument  and onc the decis is public  then the vote is public   now  we could make anyon who ask for the vote talli go through the process of file a foia request  use the act that way would get us ten day mayb befor we would have to releas the vote   but we would be use the act in a way that it was not intend
now we have gotten this legal advic on the tabl   there are argument on the other side  and i don   t know if they outweigh the legal advic   most of the argument on the other side go in the direct of the point that cathi just rais  which is whether immedi disclosur might somehow or other feed back onto our decisionmak process in a detriment way   perhap by make committe member either more or less will to dissent   anoth argument one could make is that we are a veri consensus driven institut  and that has brought us a great deal of credibl and support in the market and among the public at larg   therefor  disclos the vote talli and the name of ani dissent at the same  e that we disclos the statement regard our polici decis would tend to undercut the consensus driven natur of our decis   the simultan disclosur of the decis and the vote would put a great deal of focus on the dissent as oppos to the major view and therebi dilut the strength of the major view  if you will   the other argument against immedi disclosur  and it should be veri clear on the tabl  is that this is a bit of a slipperi slope   onc we disclos the exist of a dissent and the name of the dissent  let   s say through our press offic  some excit will aris   there will be a bit of frenzi among the press to arrang to talk to that individu and find out whi he or she dissent on the vote  follow our meet we have a two  or three day    blackout    period dure which we do not talk to the press  and that give us some protect   but onc we are outsid that period  it   s go to requir a great deal of disciplin on the part of a dissent who want to respect the consensus driven natur of the fomc   s decisionmak process to manag what could be a fair tough press interact without undermin the major view   so  there are veri legi  argument on the other side   when i thought about this  i felt that it was an extrem close call   but we do have these legal consider that we   ve talk about as well  so  those are the issu on the tabl   i think in part we have a process issu  but as   has indic  we also are deal with a somewhat broader but more focus legal issu as well  i believ the main point have been made   a number of other might emerg dure the cours of our discuss   at this stage  i think the best approach is to open this up for general discuss among us and get perspect on how you think we ought to proceed now that you   ve been brief on the matter
i was sit on the fenc until i heard the legal opinion  and what struck me is that the real choic are whether we chang our practic now or whether we do it essenti in respons to other peopl   s action   if i thought that we could go on indefinit the way we are  frank i would think serious about not releas the vote talli becaus in fact nobodi has been press us to do so   and it  sn   t strike me as a    market necessari    issu   it   s not obvious to me how much the market would benefit from this inform   but i must say that given the legal opinion  which strike me as pretti much overwhelm  i don   t see how we can avoid do what you suggest   so that   s where i would come out
okay   presid jordan
i would have prefer to leav our practic as it was   but now i see this as a done deal becaus we   re go to releas minut in six or seven week that will reflect this discuss   so now i   m go to have to decid whether i want to vote against this and have the press disclos that i   m against transpar    laughter   i realli wish that this item had not been on the agenda
well  the secretari alway write the minut veri care   and i say this quit serious   you ought to vote for what you think is right   we can manag the fact that we had a discuss about ongo issu regard transpar   if you feel despit this legal opinion and other consider that this is still not someth you want to do  then pleas be driven by that   don   t be driven by what might happen six week or so from now becaus i feel certain that we can manag that aspect   presid santomero
i   d like to pick up on the slipperi slope point that you talk about  i don   t think we can consid this from the perspect of whether we do or do not want to make the vote public   i believ we want to think about the world as it will exist under the new scenario and examin that a bit to see whether or not there are mechan in place or that need to be put in place to deal with that altern scenario   specif  i could see a world in which we in stepwis fashion announc the vote without attribut by name  as you suggest in the first part of your propos   then the press will tri to figur out exact who vote in what way and how it will be announc   then there is a realiz that in fact we have to releas the vote with name and then the press will immedi go to the person or person in question for a document of the dissent posit   in that case we would go to step three  which becom the vote  the name or name and the point counterpoint be part of the debat associ with the announc   in truth we   re go to land at the end of that slipperi slope veri quick  as the press tri to figur out what to make of what we have done   so it   s more than a question of whether we releas the vote   it   s realli about how we are go to chang the mechan of communic associ with this process   when we announc a formal vote that involv dissent by name  we almost of necess have to set up the major view and the minor view and be prepar  if you will  for at least some document or discuss of those view  that take this a lot further than the question of whether we should slip into our press statement a sentenc that say in effect      by the way the committe approv this decis by a vote of x and y      given that the law say we have to disclos the vote as soon as somebodi ask for it  the onli issu is whether we are proceed down the administr path in such a manner that the disclosur is a credibl way of present our view regard the appropri monetari polici   and that   s a lot harder issu to assess
could   answer the question  is there a step     weren   t you say  that we   d have to releas both the talli and the name of ani dissent
if we have a request under the freedom of inform act  yes
okay  so there isn   t realli
there is a kind of conceptu step    right
that step is decid just to disclos the vote talli   and then peopl will tri to identifi the dissent or dissent
may i ask a follow up question to counsel
let   s say i dissent  which i don   t plan to do  and the press ask me whi i dissent   is there a foia oblig for me to explain that   or can i explain it when i choos to explain it or when the committe choos to have me explain it
under the committe   s current procedur  when the committe releas the minut the reason for your dissent is in the minut
i thought a member need not put the reason for his dissent in the minut
he need not   but if he choos to  of cours
but i think that   s the question that   s be ask  is it not
no   he understood the question i ask   my question was  do i have to answer inquiri about the reason for my dissent as soon as somebodi  from the press ask for it
and the answer to that i gather is    no
the answer is    no
but that   s not a great deal of comfort
no  it   s not   may i respond to a point that presid santomero rais   we have a process now of disclos the exist of contrari view  includ the strength and natur of those view  in the minut   i do not think anyth we   ve talk about here would chang that process   certain i am not put on the tabl that we do anyth other than disclos the major consensus view in our offici statement   also  with regard to the slipperi slope issu  as all of you who have been on the committe for some  e know  we are still struggl with the question of at what point we should releas the minut   so we might come back to that question  though not at this meet   but that could be a way to handl the issu of when and how we disclos minor major posit  there is one other fact that i should put on the tabl   when we look into this issu  one thing we review was the natur of the press coverag   and as far as we could tell the market reaction   to the releas of the vote and the name of dissent on discount rate action  which by definit mean board member   actual  the press coverag was surpris mute  those vote with dissent were primarili   to   vote  or occasion   to   vote when there were seven board member   the press coverag typic just reflect the fact that governor x vote against this chang in the discount rate or  for exampl  that governor x has long been on record as think that rate should not continu to rise or declin   and there seem to be no market reaction   so as we think about the frenzi and excit  it may becom mute over  e   the first  e it could be quit excit   but after a while  if an individu has a long record of perspect that differ somewhat from the major view and choos to dissent  it could be that the press coverag will be straightforward   it may simpli be report that board member x or reserv bank presid y   who has long been on record as not favor whatev the decis was   dissent   so the evid   not suggest that there will be an ongo frenzi and excit with a focus on dissent   past press coverag of dissent suggest that there will be a pass observ but not too much excit about them   that   s not a predict of the futur  but there is some reason to be op ist that  if we manag ourselv  well  the press will eventu manag itself well
roger  when was the last  e that we had dissent on a discount rate action
the last  e i saw was
so that was befor our current practic of releas a statement    which   get a lot of attent   that began in
thing certain have chang
and all the wire servic pick up our decis quit prompt
that   s absolut true   but the other side of the coin is that in that earlier period the discount rate was the onli signal about decis on interest rate movement that was made public   everyth els had to be gather from tri to interpret the oper of the desk   so there was certain some focus on discount rate action   the news articl were as long and as abund as they are now   so it has play both way   there was certain a desir to find out what was go on  and in a sens that was the onli signal that the feder reserv gave   so the situat was differ but not total differ from today   presid parri  you   re the next one on my list
well  i wish we had never start down this road as well   but i am uncomfort about releas the vote talli  includ the name of a dissent  by itself   the import inform is realli not found in the numer talli but in the direct and the rational for ani dissent   simpli report the exist of a dissent after an fomc meet without reveal it motiv could add nois to market unless it is clarifi   even if dissent are identifi  it seem unten that further question about the direct and rational of their dissent vote could be left unansw until the releas of the minut  especi given the typic six week lag in their releas   in the interim  the pressur for disclosur would be intens  and the possibl of erron specul would be counterproduct   i also would like to know a bit more about the practic of other central bank   for exampl  the bank of england  sn   t releas the vote talli along with the press releas announc it decis   that is made public onli with the releas of the minut  which of cours occur two week later
foia is an american law
that   s right   presid broaddus
i came in here expect to resist this for all of the reason that bob parri just summar   but what i   m hear is that it   s the law of the land  and i believ this institut need to follow the spirit as well as the letter of the law   so i think we have to do it  but to come back to someth that you said  roger  this rais a question about the  e of the releas of the minut for the meet   so if we do this  i think we need to address that issu at a fair earli date becaus that   s the onli way we   re go to provid the full pictur with a balanc regard the view on the committe
al  do you mean we have to releas the name or releas the name and the rational
as i understood it  to abid by the spirit of the law we should releas the dissent and the name of the dissent but not the argument  right
that   s correct
you   re not requir to releas the argument
we   re not requir to do that   but we are requir  essenti  to do  the other
all i   m say is that i think we have to recogn that and do it  but if we do that  then we need to get the full argument on the tabl as quick as possibl  that   s becaus  even if the dissent don   t give their rational for dissent  the focus is go to be on those dissent   so at that point the pictur becom unbalanc  and in my view we need to get a fuller account out as soon as we can
given this discuss  i believ as al   that thing have chang here  but i think releas the vote and identifi who dissent without context is counterproduct  i think it is harm   as you said  we have a consensus  we have someon who disagre with it  and the consensus carri   that consensus is realli the messag of the fomc   and to have    nois     as someon character it  without ani explan is not better transpar   perhap it   lead to more of a slipperi slope  but i realli don   t see how we can go this way without releas the minut a lot sooner than we do now becaus that   s the onli way we can get dissent into the context of the whole discuss   that would be help  wherea just to disclos the vote and indic that we had a dissent but not say whi is counterproduct in my opinion
most of the point i want to make have been made  so i won   t repeat them   but build on what tom just said  couldn   t we make the argument that if we were to releas the minut a bit earlier  perhap in ten day or two week  that that would be satisfactori   i   d suggest that we give ourselv more  e to think about this question and even work more on the legal issu and then perhap come back in anoth meet or two and discuss it further   i think it could be argu that to proceed with the propos that is on the tabl at the moment might harm the decisionmak process signific   so  if in fact we have the option of come back to this issu with the prospect of releas the minut on a more  e basi    in a week or two   would that not reason pass mu    couldn   t we delay the releas of the vote talli for that short a period of  e in order to get the decis in the right perspect and be sure that we don   t harm the process

may i make a suggest   in listen to this discuss  it is evid that this is a veri involv situat   therefor  i think it probabl would be wise for us to have a more thorough set of option and integr into the paper the legal imper  which it didn   t have   one option that we do have is essenti to fend off all request until we are legal bound to releas this inform  and then decid what to do   altern  we could move up the releas of the minut to virtual real  e if that   s even remot feasibl
did you faint    laughter
our next retir parti will be don   s    laughter
but befor we reach a decis   and i think it   s rather obvious that this is an import decis that should not be made in hast   i think it   s worthi of further thought   we don   t have to make a decis today
certain after this discuss i strong agre with that   what i think we need to do now  have seen that this issu is in a sens more complex than anyon thought origin  is to come back with a fuller rang of option  one option we can consid    and it   s someth i   ve been oppos to until now  but i may have to rethink it   is move up the releas date of the minut   we need to see what process we can chang to tri to get the minut closer to real  e  understand with the feder reserv bank of new york what it mean to be closer to real  e   but i think the mindset we should have go into this is that in some sens we   re stuck in a veri awkward posit   we don   t want to be embarrass later so we   re tri to get ahead of the game here   howev  i do believ that we owe the committe between now and the next meet an effort to develop a fuller set of option and a better understand of what we actual can do   i don   t understand   well  i do understand what the  bank of england has to do to get it minut out within two week  and it   s far differ from what we do now   so we have to look at this more close   i never regret have to make a tough decis  but this tough decis deserv more thought than we could give it at the present  e
you know  there is an option we haven   t discuss   we have essenti two set of disclosur with respect to everi meet   one is the minut  and the other is the transcript   i   m not recommend this necessarili  but we could probabl produc summari minut within twenti four hour   so we   d have three document cover each meet   we would then have six week or so to produc the full minut
there are a number of option  and we realli do have to think about them   but we need to realiz that we are go to be in a posit where we have to disclos dissent earlier than we current do   the messag that i   m take from this discuss is that we would prefer to do that in such a way that it creat context  reduc the press excit  and make the releas of inform as contemporan to the meet as possibl and not six week after a meet   but i sens strong that this notion of just disclos the talli has left everyon somewhat uneasi   there are a number of hand in the air   whi don   t we start with
i agre complet that we should delay this decis and studi the option further   i would like to know how quick we could produc minut of the same qualiti that we put out now   and in addit to the criteria you were lay out  roger  i would suggest two more   i think we also have to do this in a way that   not have a chill effect on peopl   s willing to dissent at a meet and in a way that   not detract from the consensus driven natur of the deliber of this bodi   that consensus driven natur is someth that i believ has serv us veri well over the year and i would certain like to do everyth we can to maintain it
we absolut don   t want to destroy that   presid  n
i   ll await the next round of discuss on this
given the legal opinion that   s on the tabl  it seem to me that the issu is rather narrow   first of all  we need to know whether minut in two week  for exampl  would satisfi the law   and if there   s a view that it wouldn   t  then we might as well take minut in two week off the tabl becaus that   s not go to do the job   second  it seem to me that there are two option here   we can wait until we get a foia request  or we can get ahead of the game and do someth befor a request   i would favor the latter  get ahead of the game   if we   re go to get ahead of the game  there are two way to do that   one is to announc in advanc this chang in practic   anoth is to announc it at the  e the first dissent come along   i would be in favor of the former way rather than wait until there   s a dissent   also  i think there would be an advantag if we could close this issu at our next meet   we could then say  that we discuss it along with the usual busi conduct at the begin of each year  which includ the review of the author and direct regard desk oper   we can wrap this into the normal review of practic and procedur and have it look as routin as possibl and tri to take some of the surpris out of it
as i said  i think we can manag that   also  i believ you   re probabl right that if we   re go to maintain credibl and trust  it   s better for us to be ahead of the game as oppos to be caught in an awkward posit   so this is a question of be thought about how to be ahead of the game  i think
roger  could i speak to that
yes  pleas
we all maintain a lot of data that we have found over the year are subject to a foia request   have data that are    foia abl    in one form or anoth and not releas those data in the absenc of such a request is not illeg   that   s not someth we have to be asham about   we don   t have to feel that just becaus inform exist we   re wrong not to releas it   i think we need to look at what make the committe function best and justifi our decis in that context   and if we are requir to disclos this vote talli  given the inform we alreadi make avail to the public  we need to figur out a way to do so in a fashion that work best in term of the committe   s effect   i don   t think have not releas data that are subject to foia is a problem
i agre with that   we may look at the various option and decid that none of them make us feel comfort and we will just take the risk of wait   that   s a decis for the committe   governor bie
if the goal of this is to increas understand and transpar  i   m a littl uncomfort say that we would have a press offic provid this inform in respons to a question   even if that were to happen today   becaus that mean that we don   t control the  releas of the inform   one of the thing we might want to have our press peopl do   i   m volunt them for this   is to look at some of the practic corpor employ when they adopt fair disclosur regul a year ago   that made a lot of compani look close at how disclosur were made  includ how the internet is use for inform purpos   one of the risk of have the wire servic pick up inform such as this versus put it in a formal document is that the spin on it is control by the wire servic  anoth thing a lot of compani do  even though a number of action may be taken at one board meet  is to issu separ press releas   perhap we could look at do someth along those line   on the day of our meet we could releas our polici statement   and we call it that   and then at the appropri  e  as the chairman was allud to  we could have other releas   that may be anoth way to handl it   the messag in the polici statement is what we want to get out   it give peopl some knowledg about our decis  it repres our consensus and our main conclus   and then the other inform is releas at a later point   in a day or within the next coupl of day   and it   s call someth els   the peopl who want to see that can see it  but it  sn   t have the strength nor get the attent that the polici statement    at ani rate  there might be some thing we can learn from the way corpor handl  disclosur
presid pool   rais an interest question   when a foia request is present  there   s often a signific  e lag befor an institut respond becaus there   s the matter of get the inform togeth   is there ani reason standard wherebi we could conceiv put out the minut  say  two week later as a mean of be  respons to that request
i   d have to look at that   but there is a prescrib  et  you have ten or fifteen day in which you have to make a respons to a foia request   so if you could get the minut out within that  e period  technic you could follow that procedur
so that may be one option
that   s onli the first  e  though  isn   t it
that   s the first  e
no  technic   i   d have to look at this more close   you can do it for everi vote at everi meet
that   s import to know   whether we have that option    in this particular discuss
when i saw the question be present i couldn   t help think back to thirti year ago when i was work on the staff of a republican congressman from minnesota  i spent a remark amount of  e consid the issu of the fed   s independ and answer question about whether or not fed secreci was in fact an indic that it was be manag by a secret one world conspiraci   art rolnick and i were talk earlier about a program in which he particip rough twenti eight year ago  when a woman jump up at a small busi seminar and rais that question again   one of the thing i   m veri pleas about is that in my current role  where all of my attent is focus on the feder reserv  i   m not hear those alleg anymor  and i think that there are at least two reason for that   one is that peopl are general happi with our countri   s econom perform  and the fed get a good deal of credit for that   second  i think the increas transpar that we   ve achiev thus far has been help   we   ve remov some of the my i about polici and the feder reserv  in my view the ul  issu here is preserv the role and the independ of the fed  as a public bodi we balanc fair delic what inform we releas and how we releas it  on the basi of that balanc  i probabl would be inclin not to releas anyth on the vote talli   howev      s comment on the legal aspect fair well forc the question as i see it  there are two part to the question of how to proceed   one relat to the market respons  and i will leav to those of you who have been around longer than i have to understand how best to  manag that   but with respect to whether to lead or to follow on the issu  i   m remind of the guidanc of an old  e minnesota politician   gari  n probabl know the person i mean    who said that when you   re be run out of town on a rail  pick up a flag and lead the charg   laughter   there is some valu to get out in front   not to respond but to lead   as long as we know we   re go that way
well  let me close the discuss if i might  mr  chairman   i think  we have some march order here  to which don     and i   and perhap we   ll get some other volunt   will respond   we   ll have to tri to come back to this committe by the march meet with a rang of option   if it   s all right with you  mr  chairman  i may reconstitut in an inform way that subgroup of presid and board member who look at the last round of transpar issu and give them a chanc to be an earli sound board on what we come up with  let me close by tell you about my thought when i found myself in the posit of have to decid whether or not to send out a memo on this issu to the committe   i knew it  was much more complic than it seem  and i share much of jerri   s perspect in that i wish i hadn   t thought of this problem without have a solut to it   but i decid to proceed and put the issu to the committe as oppos to veto it myself  in effect  by keep it secret  and i think by and larg that was the right decis   i think we will  as governor olson said  end up in the right place and do what is good for everybodi   i don   t regret rais this  though i know it   s one of the hardest non monetari polici decis we might have to make as a committe   but i am high confid that  after the discuss we   ve had today and the one we   ll have in march  we will get to a veri good place   thank you veri much
that march meet is schedul for march      this meet is adjourn  and we will have some interest luncheon convers   first of all  don winn will do  as he put it     an abbrevi legisl report      then   madigan will discuss the lombard facil   let   s go eat  end of meet
