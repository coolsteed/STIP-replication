good morn  everyon   let me just remind you that  we   re go to tri to fit our slight modifi format into a one day set today   we still plan to have two full round of discuss  the first round on the economi and the outlook  and i hope we can complet that befor the coffe break   then we will have the second round on polici and the statement   so to allow  e for discuss  i hope that peopl will tri to keep their remark reason concis   at the end of the meet  we   ll have a brief report from governor kohn on his communic subcommitte  and we   ll talk a bit about procedur for think about the question of a one day versus a two day meet   so first on the agenda   dino  thank you  mr  chairman   we all know that asset price can be volatil
some  too volatil   well  the last few month have not had that qualiti   volatil in all asset class  with the except of commod  continu to be low   and yet  despit that low volatil  over the past six month investor  trader  and strategist have alreadi been through three veri differ phase   late last year  market particip were confid that monetari polici in the unit state was at or near neutral and that onc neutral was achiev   at   or    percent   the committe would stop tighten   then the market temporarili got work up that monetari polici was get too tight and that the inevit slowdown would caus the committe to be eas later this year   now we are in a new phase  in which worri about nascent inflat have supplant the earlier fear of a slowdown and the discuss about neutral has all but evapor   market haven   t been volatil  but sen ent has   on page    the top two panel graph the three month deposit rate for dollar  euro  and yen deposit and three   six   and nine month forward rate for each   u s  dollar forward rate are trade on top of each other  anticip either the end of the tighten cycl or a lengthi paus start some  soon   the minut of the committe   s march meet made public in mid april and the chairman   s jec tes oni were both taken as signal that a paus was on the horizon  despit the qualifi languag in both and despit other data that were general strong and that contribut to the rise in long term yield  which i   ll talk about later   in the euro area  forward rate continu their steadi upward climb as growth forecast increas  busi confid improv  and the european central bank signal that more tighten was like   market anticip rough    basi point of tighten per quarter through year end   the list of central bank that have tighten recent includ canada    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     switzerland  australia  norway  thailand  and malaysia   the peopl   s bank of china rais the minimum lend rate that financi institut can charg    basi point  to      percent  though i   m not sure that qualifi as a tighten for an economi with real growth in doubl digit   the bank of japan is work to slowli bring down the current account balanc   from about  ¥   trillion  balanc have now been reduc to about half that level   the boj will continu to bring them down over the next month and then will like maintain a buffer abov requir reserv for a period to give bank more  e to adjust to the interest rate target framework that will follow   as the middl panel show  yen forward rate have continu to rise  and market now presum that the boj will bring the overnight call rate to    basi point some  this autumn   but rumor circul overnight that the first increas could come as earli as juli   those rumor fuel a rise of   basi point in two year japanes govern bond yield and euroyen futur   the bottom panel graph the two  and ten year treasuri yield and the target fed fund rate   sinc the last meet  the ten year yield has risen    basi point  and the curv has steepen   this is consist with the eb of worri about a polici induc slowdown  the curv steepen was given a push by news  particular the releas of the minut  of a possibl paus in the cycl   page   break down the increas in ten year yield   the top left panel graph the real ten year yield   real yield have risen about    basi point sinc earli march and    basi point sinc the last fomc meet   the top right panel graph the ten year breakeven rate  the blue line  and five year breakeven rate five year forward  the   line    both have risen sinc earli april with the five year forward rate rise somewhat more   on a technic note  these are straight breakeven rate without adjust for carri   the pictur of rise real and rise breakeven rate is also visibl intern   at least for those countri with inflat link bond   the middl left panel graph the chang in the real yield this year for franc  the unit kingdom  and japan   real yield have risen in all three by vari degre   the middl right panel graph the chang in their breakeven rate   all three have move about    basi point so far this year   somewhat less than the    basi point increas for the unit state   fuel the sen ent about inflat expect has been the rise in commod price  the bottom left panel graph select metal price index from januari     some of these are at record high or  in the case of gold  multidecad high   the right panel graph the movement of energi price so far this year   the one outlier is natur gas  which rose sharpli after katrina but fell back when consumpt did not meet forecast becaus of an unseason warm winter   let us turn to page   and the other element that has garner substanti attent   the recent weak of the dollar   after be stuck in a narrow       to       rang  the euro appreci out of that rang in mid april as sen ent turn against the dollar  as shown in the top left panel   this morn it was trade just below         meanwhil  the yen appreci from  ¥    to the dollar in earli april to about  ¥       this morn   it   s tempt to conclud that the current account deficit is final exert itself on the exchang rate   call me skeptic  but i find it hard to believ that market awok to the scale of the imbal onli when read the now famous annex in the g  communiqu©   and yet that there was a shift in sen ent can be felt if not visibl observ   one place this shift in sen ent can be felt is in option market   the middl left panel graph one month risk revers  where dollar put are bid relat to dollar call  especi against the yen  and suggest that market particip are more concern about further downsid for the dollar  anoth view into this phenomenon is through interest rate differenti   the middl right panel graph the euro   dollar exchang rate and the differenti between decemb      eurodollar and euribor futur   the two track pretti close in      and most of this year but start to diverg in mid april  suggest that the effect of interest rate differenti on the exchang rate had lessen and  henc  that someth els was exert greater forc   so what are some possibl explan for the shift in sen ent   at the macro level  most forecast have the unit state slow down in the second half while japan and europ do not slow  even if in level term the unit state is still grow fa    second  the strong growth of the global economi is be interpret by some in the leverag communiti as increas the odd that emerg asian countri in particular will allow a rise in their currenc   and henc less dollar accumul   in the period ahead   some countri are appar struggl with  il of accumul reserv   a third explan is the continu nag fear that central bank will diversifi their dollar hold   dure much of april there were rumor that a larg central bank   presum to be from the middl east   was sell dollar   whether that   s true or not  i don   t know  howev  it is true that a central bank from europ   the swedish riksbank   was in the midst of lower it dollar hold  elimin it yen hold  and increas hold of european and other currenc   the swede made their chang public on april     whether other central bank will follow is an open question  but analyst have note the prison   s dilemma that the larg holder of dollar face on this question of diversif  and it is one the market focus on intens and are acut sensit to   final  the market note the treasuri   s report on foreign hold of u s  secur for the year through june      and the unfavor revis it contain   this report correct the es  in the month tic data   wherea the tic data report that privat investor were the larg buyer in that twelv month span  it now turn out that privat demand was minim and that most of the buy was by offici account   the bottom panel chart the appreci against the dollar by a rang of currenc in the intermeet period   sever of these are commod base  but mani are not   and even some of the currenc i talk about last  e that had been caught in the liquid of carri trade made strong comeback   yes  even the iceland krona  which fell anoth    percent after your last meet  has revers cours and  on balanc  has risen slight sinc march      i should note that the canadian dollar is at it strongest level against the u s  dollar sinc        besid the posit term of trade shock  the canadian have both strong growth and low inflat and someth we don   t have   a current account surplus and an ongo budget surplus that is be use to pay down debt   chang pace a bit  if you turn to page    the top panel graph the evolut of requir oper balanc sinc      and the target fed fund rate   requir oper balanc  rob  have fallen sharpli as the opportun cost of hold demand deposit has risen  from a peak of about     billion  requir balanc have fallen to about     billion  signific chang in the level of rob have been associ with chang in fed fund rate volatil becaus lower level of such balanc give bank less scope for absorb daili shock to their reserv hold at the fed   meanwhil  a lower level of rob provid the desk with less scope to manag the fund rate by adjust the daili reserv suppli without forc bank either to borrow at the discount window or to accumul unwant excess reserv   so far the effect of the declin in requir oper balanc has been mute  and we do have some experi in oper in such an environ from the last  e that requir balanc were at such level in the late     s and the earli part of this decad   final  i want to inform the committe that the desk has just finish implement a new electron trade system that we call fedtrad and through which we conduct open market oper with the primari dealer   this system replac a legaci mainfram system that was inflex and no longer suit our need   the bottom panel list some of fedtrad   s main featur   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper   i will need approv of domest oper
thank you   on the rise in inflat breakeven sinc our last  meet  do you have a sens about the breakdown between carri effect  expect  and risk premium
well  as somebodi said in anoth set just the other day  risk premium are someth we don   t know a lot about  and they are difficult to disentangl   i haven   t done the exercis  but with energi price rise  i don   t know that the carri effect have been huge
the carri effect are go to matter onli for the first part of it   and as we note in the bluebook  at the  e we had an increas in inflat compens of about    basi point  most of it was relat to energi price   if you think about the term structur of energi futur  they actual tilt down at the far end  and so that would go the wrong way   so everyth in term of the rise in the five year ahead five year forward rate would be inflat compens   if you go to our multifactor model of the term structur  we would attribut someth like half to term premium  and half then would be inflat expect
my other question relat to a regulatori relief bill in the congress  which is veri like to pass  that would allow us to pay interest on reserv and to have more flexibl in set requir reserv   would you like to comment on the potenti oper implic of that
we would welcom that   it would make our life a bit easier
do you see ani oper issu in just get to the point where we can manag that
i don   t think so   spenc
no  i think that adapt to that environ would not be a problem for us   it would probabl be veri easi to do
mr  chairman  i would note that the first place i could find mention of the feder reserv   s ask about pay interest on reserv was in        but there are some oper implic  includ in the star  statist and reserv  process  of actual figur out a way of pay interest on reserv   it came close about four year ago  i guess  and we had put modif into star in order to be abl to pay interest on reserv   there might be some bump along the way
but those are transit  oper hurdl
in fact  the point of ask for this author was to make sure that the desk didn   t run into issu in the futur of the sort that dino was outlin   we can put the interest on balanc at the feder reserv at such a level that bank can arbitrag these balanc and we won   t have troubl hit our target
no  i understand it   s a good thing for us
as for the longer run implic  onc we   re assur that there   s a stabl demand for reserv  we can simplifi reserv requir  which are quit antiqu and kind of embarrass
includ simplifi them at zero    laughter
what   s the probabl that this is go to pass
it appear to be veri high
it   s in both the hous and the senat bill  but the hous bill is a veri differ bill   it has controversi thing in it
haven   t we been there befor
no   we haven   t gotten quit this far befor
they elimin a number of controversi item so that this could go through   other question   presid
my sens is that the broad convent way of think about how we would implement interest on reserv is to pay a rate of interest somewhat below the feder fund target rate  my sens is that the convent view emerg at a  e when we were less transpar about our target of the fund rate   the chairman ask you whether it would be an oper problem for you   the natur thing  if you   re peg the fund rate  is to use the rate of interest on deposit to do it  so you don   t have to es  where the demand curv for fund lie everi day   have you folk thought about whether pay interest on reserv at the target rate would be a feasibl mechan
i can speak onli for myself   i have work on the presumpt that we would set it  as you start out  below the fund rate  so we would in effect be creat someth of a corridor with the primari credit rate on top and a deposit facil at the bottom   now  whether that would be   percent below     percent  or some other number would be up to other to decid   but i think that   s the way that i view it rather than pay it at the target
we have thought of differ way that the abil to pay interest on reserv could be use  and you   re make a distinct between a rate that might be paid on excess and a rate that might be paid on requir   mayb they   d be the same  mayb they would be differ   depend on which you chose  you could have a veri differ framework for implement polici on a day to day basi   oper  from the desk   s perspect  they could both be execut in a fair straightforward fashion
other question   presid hoenig
may i just ask about the breakeven rate in tip   we look at it and saw perhap some season to it   is that just nonsens  or have you look at it or thought about it
i   ve spoken about that in the past actual   there has been some season   it has happen befor   that some season move upward have occur in the first part of the year
usual this part of the year
yes  usual in this part of the year   that relationship has not been stabl  but one has notic that there has been that tendenc
but you haven   t actual systemat look at it
we look at it a coupl of year ago  and we note it  but i think it was just too unstabl
have noth to do with the subject we   re current discuss  but go back to your chart of metal price  is there a way to get a judgment from the staff as to how much of this is specul and how much of it is real demand and what the volum expans has been on the differ exchang   we probabl alreadi have that  vinc  but it would be help   we keep discuss this with regard to oil price  for exampl   in term of the big integr compani  nobodi know the answer  that i can determin  but clear a good deal of this is specul activ as oppos to real demand   the question is  could somebodi send around a memo that give us a breakdown  if possibl
we could look into it
includ the volum expans
yes   the volum expans are someth we can probabl get data on   i   m not sure that do so will answer the question that you would like answer  which is how much of the price movement is link to certain class of particip
for exampl  exxon will tell you that  in term of futur trade just on oil  west texa crude was   billion in       this year it   s run at a     billion rate   that tell you someth   we just don   t know what   but it would be help for us to get a breakdown   at least it would be help to me
hear no other question  we need a vote to ratifi domest oper   do we have a motion
ani object   thank you   yes   dino
veri briefli  i circul a memo that come around at this  e everi year ask you to vote to approv renew of the swap line to canada and mexico
do i have a motion
discuss   presid
i intend to vote    no    on this motion for the reason relat to those i gave in januari for vote against the foreign exchang author   a general sens of opposit to our central bank   s be involv in foreign exchang oper  much less lend to foreign central bank
other comment   i   ll ask for a show of hand   all in favor  oppos   thank you  we have an issu relat to foia   a memorandum was distribut propos to deleg certain foia respons as describ in the may   note to the committe from scott alvarez and kit wheatley   scott is here  i assum   yes  there he is   are there ani question for scott   these are just technic chang   do i have a motion
so move   thank you   ani object   all right   thank you veri much   okay   our next item on the agenda is the econom situat
thank you  mr  chairman   i am told that counselor are taught to begin by acknowledg the valid of the fear and anxieti of those whom they are counsel   the strategi then is to deconstruct and examin in greater detail the specif sourc of heighten anxieti in order to gain better perspect on the problem at hand  be a natur anxious person  i have had moment in the past six week when i felt the need to engag in a littl    self help    therapi by employ this strategi on myself   so this morn  i thought that i would report the result of my effort to identifi and analyz some of the develop over the intermeet period that could have made one more uneasi about the outlook for activ and inflat   i   ll admit that there have been a few reason to be concern   the growth in real gdp in the first quarter was veri strong   even stronger than we had expect in the march  book   and most compon of spend surpris us to the upsid   moreov  hard evid of the anticip second quarter slowdown is still spars   meanwhil  inflat concern have been mount   oil price are up anoth     per barrel  and the price of non oil commod are soar amid sign that the global economi is strengthen   the dollar seem to be sink on good news and bad   the incom data on core consum price have exceed our expect a bit   and measur of expect inflat have move higher   clear  there is plenti to keep one up at night   at other  e  i have awoken with the fear that recent develop could provok us into a familiar trap of overshoot on polici   if polici were to lean against strength in activ and inflat pressur that was larg seen in the rear view mirror  the risk of tighten too much and for too long would be amplifi   in that regard  the evid has continu to accumul that hous market are soften  and last friday   s employ report at least hint at some slow in labor demand   tighten signific further when the economi alreadi may have begun to deceler risk an unwelcom cyclic downturn in the economi   given our poor track record in predict recess  one should not take light the risk of overshoot the mark   i   m not embarrass to admit that i   ve harbor both fear   that of fall behind the curv and that of overshoot   often on the same day and some  even in the same convers with my colleagu    laughter   but in the end  i have come to the view that  while you are almost certain somewhat behind or somewhat ahead of the curv  there are some good reason to think that you are not too far from the curv   so just how strong is the economi at present  and will it maintain that strength go forward   as you know  we had been expect a big bump up in the growth of output in the first quarter  in part as activ rebound from hurrican depress level   and we sure got it   we are now es  that the growth of real gdp in the first quarter was    percent  about    percentag point fa  than project in the march  book   that said  it is import not to exagger the extent to which that surpris signal greater under momentum in the economi   about half of our miss in the first quarter reflect higher than expect feder spend   while i   ll admit that    higher than expect feder spend    might seem to be an oxymoron  we view the first quarter miss as larg one of  e  relat in part to fema outlay   we are expect the level of feder spend to drop back in the current quarter  inventori invest outsid the motor vehicl sector  after be veri subdu in the second half of last year  also has surpris us to the upsid of late   although it is present provid a lift to activ  we would not expect inventori invest to be a sourc of ongo impetus to product   of cours  these were not our onli surpris   household and busi spend  too  have come in abov our expect  and we read domest demand as have somewhat greater momentum than we had earlier thought   as a consequ  we revis up our project for second quarter growth in real gdp to    percent   similar to the abov trend pace that we experienc over the past year   had everyth els remain as it was in march  this greater strength in near term activ would have led us to mark up our forecast for the remaind of the year as well   but there have been some power countervail forc with which we have had to contend   the steep rise in the price of crude oil has continu to siphon purchas power from the household sector   the bill for import oil is now expect to be about     billion per year higher than in our march project   moreov  gasolin price have increas even more than oil price  reflect a tight inventori situat that has result from some refineri shutdown and from the higher cost associ with the switch in blend of reformul gasolin   becaus the spend propens of oil compani sharehold are like lower than those of gasolin consum  the transfer of incom between these two group also is like to subtract some from consum spend   in the veri near term  we have household dip into save to meet their higher energi bill  but we think that some adjust to overal spend plan probabl is under way and that more will be requir in come quarter   besid the restrain effect of higher oil price  the recent increas in long term interest rate is expect to weigh on activ over the remaind of the project period   to be sure  some of that increas reflect higher expect inflat   but real long term rate have increas as well  in part as term premium have widen a bit   mortgag rate and corpor bond rate are expect to run about    to    basi point abov the level that in our previous project we had assum would prevail   obvious  those increas have been too recent to have yet affect demand  but we expect that  by the second half of the year  higher rate will be leav an imprint on hous activ and busi invest   as you know from read the  book  the stronger under momentum in the economi is eventu more than offset by the greater drag from higher energi price and interest rate  leav the level of output a touch weaker by the end of      than forecast in march   what about inflat concern   there can be littl doubt that price pressur have intensifi somewhat over the intermeet period   as i note earlier  crude oil price have risen about     per barrel  and particip in futur market expect those higher price to persist   other commod price have been soar as well  especi price for industri metal   these increas can be expect to add a bit to core inflat in come month  anoth troubl develop in the inflat pictur has been the increas in most measur of inflat compens and inflat expect   tip measur of inflat compens have increas between    and    basi point over the intermeet period  at the same  e  the michigan survey measur of median year ahead inflat expect increas to     percent  and the median measur of inflat expect five to ten year ahead edg up to     percent  both are about   percentag point higher than in march   still  these develop should be place in perspect   none of these measur has breach the rang that has been maintain over the past few year   and there have been sever episod dure that period when expect move up as much as or more than they have in the past six week  onli to revers cours on softer news about the economi or inflat   so for now  it is difficult to gaug the extent to which there has been ani meaning deterior in inflat expect   moreov  we have scant evid that higher price inflat or higher inflat expect have becom embed in labor cost  as you know  the employ cost index  eci  rose at an annual rate of just     percent in the first three month of the year  more than     percentag point less than we had project  in contrast  we current es  that compens per hour in the nonfarm busi sector increas at a    percent annual rate in the first quarter  about     percentag point more than we had project   nonetheless  despit their diverg movement last quarter  both measur actual deceler over the past year   to be sure  becaus labor compens tend to lag price in the overal inflat process  this observ should provid onli limit solac   but i do think the incom inform on labor cost make it more difficult to argu that you have fallen far behind the curv   we continu to expect the growth of hour labor compens to pick up go forward in respons to tight labor market  the increas in labor product that have occur in recent year  and the lag effect of higher price inflat   nevertheless  with price markup at veri high level  the project acceler in hour labor compens is expect to result chiefli in some narrow of profit margin rather than in an increas in price inflat   what about the price data themselv   both the core consum price index  cpi  and core person consumpt expenditur  pce  price rose     percent in march  exceed our expect   some of the surpris in both measur was attribut to higher than expect increas in apparel price that may have more to do with imperfect anticip season pattern than under trend and to a step up in medic price relat to increas medicar reimburs   as a consequ  we attach onli a small signal to this upsid surpris   all told  the develop over the past six weekscanoth jump in oil price  some deterior of inflat expect  and a slight higher read on core inflationcl us to mark up our project of core consum price inflat  but just by     percent in both      and        the pattern of project inflat remain the same   as higher price for oil and other commod are pass through into the price of final good and servic  core pce inflat is project to move up to a    percent pace this year   with those price expect to flatten out next year and with the pass through of the earlier run up larg complet  we expect core pce inflat to eas back down to a   percent pace in        final  what about the concern that we could be in the process of overshoot the mark on polici tighten   becaus polici oper with a lag and becaus we are so poor at predict turn point  this risk seem especi relev after a period of substanti tighten   but given the strength that appear evid in both domest and foreign economi  my guess is that the expans is not so fragil that some modest overshoot on polici would result in a cyclic downturn in activ   moreov  if our baselin assess of the economi is close to the mark  a higher path for the fund rate might not even be deem an overshoot   as we note in a simul in the bluebook  greater polici tighten than is built into the baselin might be desir if your object is to achiev a more rapid and pronounc declin in core price inflat   so  in the end  while we could see a heap of worri in a varieti of differ direct  we interpret recent develop as warrant onli small chang in our forecast   that forecast remain one in which activ slow to a more sustain pace and inflat fluctuat around recent level   still  i don   t want to be seen as offer fals reassur  much could happen to chang the outlook   my own concern about potenti outcom that could take us far from the staff baselin project are center main on asset market  asset market are impress inform process machin that  for the most part  deliv veri effici outcom   but those market are also subject  from  e to  e  to abrupt shift in confid and psycholog that are difficult for forecast to predict and difficult for policymak to influenc   i see risk on both side of the ledger here   one of the risk associ with overshoot is that  at some point  higher interest rate could trigger a sharp contract in hous price and real estat activ   given the long lag with which we receiv reliabl inform on hous price  such develop might take some  e to recogn and thus might prove harder to counteract than impli by our altern scenario   of cours  undershoot on polici also present risk for asset market   if polici were to trigger a substanti fall in the dollar  inflat pressur and your effort to deal with those pressur could creat some signific challeng for monetari polici and for the economi     will have more to say on the prospect for the dollar in her present
on the intern side  two major develop dure the intermeet period merit some further discuss this morn   the rapid and sizabl run up in global price for crude oil and the signific depreci of the exchang valu of the dollar in the second half of the period   those develop occur against a background of continu strong global growth  with some econom indic again surpris us on the posit side for some countri   as a result  we are still expect moder strong foreign real gdp growth at an annual rate of     percent over the forecast period  with inflat project to remain contain although upsid risk are a concern   when we final the march  book forecast  the spot price of wti was just over     per barrel   last week  as we complet the forecast for this meet  that price reach about     per barrel befor partial retrac   the interven seven week had wit almost daili tale of woe of higher price  with the suppli problem in nigeria prove more persist and serious than earlier thought and tension over the nuclear program of iran ad to heighten pressur on energi price   in addit  outag of u s  crude product as a result of the hurrican continu  as do issu regard suppli from iraq and venezuela   event in bolivia have also rattl the energi market   as a result  and consist with the shift in futur price for the rest of this year and next  we rais the project path of the u s  oil import price about     per barrel   as in march  that path rise slight through the end of this year and then is about flat in        one signific and direct consequ of the higher oil price is an increas in the u s  oil import bill from that forecast in march   in the baselin forecast  the valu of oil import has been revis up     billion for this year and     billion for next   as a consequ  of the approxim      billion widen of the u s  nomin trade balanc that we now project from the fourth quarter of last year to the final quarter of       just about one third is account for by the enlarg oil bill   the overal trade deficit is now expect to be about     percent of gdp at the end of next year   a second consequ of higher global oil price is that the revenu to the world   s oil export have signific increas   this posit chang to the extern revenu of these countri has rais a number of question about their propens to import and from whom and their decis about how to hold the fund that they have receiv and have not as yet spent on good and servic   data on the portfolio alloc of oil revenu by mani export countri are spars  in mani case  the fund are held by nation oil compani or in special stabil fund  neither of which are like to be includ in report of foreign offici reserv   moreov  offici in some of these countri tend not to reveal detail inform about their hold   a case can be made that increas revenu flow to these countri over recent year like ad to overal global net save and contribut to low long term interest rate global   it is still uncertain whether their behavior has had or will in the futur have a systemat influenc on exchang rate   from u s  tic data  we have some limit inform about some categori of dollar hold that are current through march of this year   as was report in part   of the  book  inflow of foreign offici asset in the unit state held by opec countri were quit strong in the fourth quarter of last year and in januari   howev  in februari and march those inflow drop sharpli  as did aggreg offici inflow from other non g    countri   for total portfolio inflow to the unit state that combin public and privat investor  fund from oil export  includ the middl east  mexico  russia  and norway  were more than     billion in the first quarter   a pace compar with that in        the     billion inflow compar with es  of the net oil revenu of the oil export of about      billion in the first quarter   again  the month data show a sizabl step down in the size of inflow after januari   among the oil export  there is some variat across countri in their inflow into the unit state   after show posit inflow in the previous two year  net outflow were record for both russia and venezuela in the first quarter   in contrast  inflow from middl east oil export  mexico  and norway were strong   all told  although total inflow for oil export remain near rate in       there are some hint of possibl diversif away from asset held in the unit state by some oil export countri  especi in more recent month   i should note that these countri may hold dollar asset outsid the unit state  chang in such hold are not captur by the tic data and may give rise to entri for countri such as the unit kingdom that are the locat of major global financi intermediari   we have onli extrem partial data for u s  financi inflow in april  so it is not possibl to relat the recent sharp depreci of the dollar to ani pattern in such data   the exchang valu of the dollar fell signific against all the currenc of our index of major industri countri trade partner as well as against the currenc of brazil  korea  chile  and most other asian emerg market economi   this broad base declin reflect a signific chang in prefer on the margin among at least some global investor and may alter expect of some of those hold larg amount of dollar asset   over the intermeet period  u s  long term nomin interest rate move up near    basi point  but rate rose    or more basi point in most foreign industri countri   real long term interest rate taken from inflat index  sovereign secur in japan and the euro area also rose about    basi point  compar to the chang in u s  inflat index rate   a signific decreas in the market valu of the dollar with no evid chang in relat real rate of return on compar fix incom secur could indic an increas in the risk premium attach to hold dollar  or it could signal a chang in percept of the long run real exchang valu of the dollar   even given lag in the under relationship  the weaker project path of the dollar   show through in our forecast   for real export of core good  the drop in the level of the dollar to date and the slight fa  pace we now project for real dollar depreci impli that relat price will boost growth of these export about   percentag point more over the remaind of the forecast period than we thought in march  base on our model   for real export of servic  the stori is similar   for core import price  our equat impli a posit effect  concentr in this year   howev  when incom data and other factor are taken into account  our project for import price inflat is onli a littl abov that in the previous  book  and so the net effect on real import is neglig   for real import of servic  a negat effect from higher relat price is evid in the baselin project   for the nomin measur at the end of the forecast period  total export are revis up  but total import are up more   the enlarg oil bill account for virtual all of the upward revis to nomin total import   as a consequ  the trade deficit has been revis to a somewhat larger figur   that chang is signific offset by the effect of the lower dollar on project invest incom   the lower dollar is posit for invest incom as it translat earn abroad of u s  firm into more dollar   in addit  in our forecast those earn are direct boost by higher oil price   all told  our outlook for the current account deficit is for more rapid deterior this year than we previous thought but a deficit at the end of      that is onli slight larger than we had been expect in march    and i would be happi to answer ani question
question for our colleagu   presid
i note an altern scenario in the  book in which inflat expect are unanchor  and the descript of the scenario say that inflat expect end up    percentag point higher than in the baselin   i look around for the baselin  e seri for inflat expect  but i couldn   t find it   what are they
well  that   s a good question   the reason we don   t publish an inflat expect seri is that we   re use a lot of differ measur of inflat expect to gaug where under inflat is   we   re use a lot of differ model for that matter  too   some are pure backward look model  in which inflat expect and under inflat are basic proxi by lag inflat   in other model  there are explicit measur   for exampl  in frb us we use the philadelphia fed survey of profession forecast as a long run anchor on inflat expect  and then we allow that to move over  e as peopl are assum to learn about the fed   s inflat object   so in construct the scenario  we actual had a variabl in frb us that we could add factor up    percentag point from what it was  now  i think the deeper question you   re ask is  what do we think under inflat is current in the economi  and what lie under the staff   s inflat project   we think there has probabl alreadi been  rough speak  someth like    percentag point deterior in under inflat from where it was in       when actual inflat was run just a littl abov   percent   we thought that was unusu low  and our es  of under inflat was about     percent  what fit into this forecast now is that there probabl has been some upward creep rough on the order of    percentag point to someth like   percent   the scenario that we were show you in this  book had some further deterior over and abov that   until recent  there wasn   t a lot  other than the pickup in actual core inflat itself  that we could point to for a deterior in inflat expect   i think we   re still nervous about make that call in this forecast   it could veri well be that inflat expect have remain well anchor  and we have been show some scenario in the  book that take that possibl into account   as i note in my brief  although one could use what   s happen to inflat expect and inflat compens over the intermeet period as be support or consist with what under the forecast  we still think it   s too earli to make the call that a determin has definit occur   so  our basic view is that there has probabl been some pickup   it   s been limit   but obvious  there are risk on both side of that   one side is that inflat expect could have stay better anchor   on the other  there may be the risk that inflat expect are at the front edg of a process of increas and that they will continu to deterior
i appreci your answer   let me tell you what motiv my question  first was the broad concern about inflat   but  second  in look at the  book and think through the outlook  i see that inflat expect held by market particip are a key conceptu anchor for us   i note that you tell us quantit about other sort of latent variabl   for exampl  the nairu and potenti output   i thought perhap inflat expect deserv the same explicit quantit treatment in the  book
if i could respond to that for just a second   i   d be happi to write a number down on the back of an envelop   laughter   if we were to write a number down  i   d caution you not to take it too serious   i think you ought to be look at survey measur of inflat expect   you ought to be look at market base measur of inflat expect   and in some sens  i think you still need to take serious model that have adapt expect as well  becaus they could be reflect how peopl are learn or how they might be influenc by past inflat   we show some of those thing   we could show a lag inflat term  or as i say  we could certain creat a variabl that we would call inflat expect for purpos of the staff forecast   but i   d be nervous about give it promin over and abov these other measur that i think you should be take on board as well
i can appreci that  but it come up in our deliber   last fall  we were talk about the reaction to katrina  and you were show us a scenario in which core inflat rose and then fell in the first half of this year   i ask you what happen to inflat expect along that path  and they rose and then smooth fell   for us to get a handl on whether that   s a reason scenario  it help to think through what would bring about a fall in inflat expect like that and whether they can vari at high frequenc as they seem to have over the last month or two   but i don   t want you guy pencil down number just to pencil down number   i appreci the difficulti involv
thank you  mr  chairman   i have sever question that i will ask quick here  first of all  i do want to commend the board staff and the staff of the reserv bank on the special survey   i thought the inform on nonresidenti construct was veri use  here are my question   first  is there a way we can reconcil the eci and the compens data   they seem to be further apart than typic   i don   t know technic whether do so is possibl or the extent to which it   s possibl   second  you note in the  book  but without ani real explan  that feder tax revenu are come in extraordinarili strong   stronger than anticip  what do we know about whi that might be the case   i would also ask about your expect narrow of profit margin   my question is  whi   there are lot and lot of econom incent for corpor manag to keep those margin high and to expand them if they can   a lot of peopl have compens link to profit  the stock market  and so forth   so it seem to me that the econom would say that there   s no reason particular to expect a revers   i gather that your explan was that it   s sort of outsid what we have typic observ and  in a  e seri sens  you expect it to go back   but i   m worri about the econom under that view   i think it   s quit import for the inflat outlook becaus  even if wage are well contain  it could well be that compani will just take price increas whenev they can and enjoy the benefit of the profit   so i   ll let you deal with those in ani way you want   laughter
about the issu of reconcil the eci with the compens per hour figur  the previous chairman tortur us  laughter    and the bureau of labor statist   for a number of year precis on this issu on the thought that we ought to be abl somehow to resolv the differ in these measur   that came to no avail    laughter  the bls for a while was publish a measur for wage of nonsupervisori worker just to see whether or not it was track  and it actual rough track what was happen in the averag hour earn taken from the establish survey  but not veri close   now  if you look at the histori of the seri  there are some veri signific gap in the past  and the one that we   re current wit actual  sn   t even necessarili stand out relat to the histor chang   one of the major factor in explain some of those past deviat was that the exercis of stock option is includ in nonfarm busi compens but not in the eci   we just don   t know at this point whether that could be explain last quarter   i think i   d make the bigger point that  over the past year  both those measur have actual slow somewhat so that  in term of their second differ  they are not tell substanti differ stori   it   s a signific frustrat for us  as i   m assum it is for you  that we   re unabl to have a better answer to reconcil them  as for tax be stronger   they have been signific stronger   obvious  at this point  we don   t realli know the reason that they have been stronger than they were project   it could be a shift in incom distribut toward higher incom individu   it could be signal greater strength in under incom than is current be measur   in the past  we have not had ani success in use those revenu surpris to predict ul  revis in aggreg incom   while i think it   s a plausibl hypothesi  it  sn   t have a lot of empir support
for us  anyway  most of the surpris has been on the nonwithheld side  on the final payment  and that implic mayb someth like capit gain rather than the sort of more direct payrol tie sourc of incom
and small upward surpris on the withheld portion   as   note  most of it is in the nonwithheld portion  on the econom behind the forecast for the profit margin to revert just a bit toward mean  there is empir and histor support for that kind of movement  and i think there are some good econom reason for it as well   obvious  incom share in the unit state have been remark stabl over long period of  e  and it has been quit typic  after period when profit margin have widen as much as they have in the past few year  for them to narrow   the mechan through which that occur is that there is both pressur come through tighter labor market to push up overal wage and competit pressur in product market to compet down those profit margin over  e through lower price  so you   re absolut right   obvious  no busi will will give up profit   but we have a good reason to think that  face with signific competit pressur  profit margin ought  over  e  to revert back to histor norm   we haven   t been terribl aggress in push this particular featur of the forecast  mean that we don   t have them come down a whole lot   we basic have them level off and just inch down further on   but we think there are some good econom reason whi that happen in the past and whi it could happen go forward   if we are experienc right now some perman shift in incom distribut away from labor toward capit  then use histori as a guid here could throw you off   but i guess that i wouldn   t start with that presumpt
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to ask about the altern simul that presid   talk about  the greater pass through with unanchor expect   it seem to give the impress that inflat is pretti control  and i have a bit more concern than that  you said in the scenario at the end that  beyond       polici would yield a notic rise in the real feder fund rate   i guess that the action is all after       the way you have phase in this gradual increas in inflat expect of    basi point   so i guess i   ll start with the question  how   it play out in       and         what would be the cost in term of output and price stabil   then  of cours  expect could rise more quick   the increas wouldn   t necessarili have to be gradual over this year and a half   what happen if inflat expect rise more quick  and what would the implic be for beyond      and
start with that last point  an increas in inflat expect lead almost one for one into actual inflat  and in relat short order   if some signific shift occur in inflat expect  you could expect that it would show up as higher inflat immedi   now  in the model  inflat is a veri inerti variabl  and that has two implic   one is that it take  e for inflat to get out of your control  but it also mean that it   s extrem cost to bring back down again   so if one look beyond the      horizon  if you want inflat at   or      you   d have a lot of work left to be done in term of generat a cumul output gap   you have the sacrific ratio  we think it is someth like     that would mean that  if you were at     and want to go to      you   d have to have four point year of unemploy abov the nairu to get inflat back down to that     level   so the news is both good and bad regard the slow respons of inflat   it   s slow to move up  but then it   s also cost to bring back down again
you see exact that point  presid    in the altern simul in the bluebook in which we ask what it would take over the extend  book period to achiev an inflat target of     percent   which effect mean to work out    percentag point worth of inflat   you have to keep the real five year interest rate almost   percentag point higher until the end of the decad to do that   you also see the import  as presid   note  of the behavior of inflat expect becaus in one simul we assum that inflat expect evolv as they have histor   that is  onli gradual adjust   in the other simul we ask  what happen if that adjust is quicker   the answer is that monetari polici is a lot easier when inflat expect are better anchor at a lower level
i found that bluebook altern simul veri help   i thought it was tie togeth with the one in the  book   i found them togeth to be veri help   it   s this inertia that concern me   earlier in my career i was involv in fight inflat  and onc it get out of control it is veri  veri difficult to bring back under control
again  as the properti of the model that dave mention  it   s a veri flat phillip curv   it take a lot of unemploy year to work that back
presid   has a two hand intervent
yes   just veri briefli  i want to get a bit more of the benefit of your expertis about how inflat expect evolv   as you note  they evolv slowli in the histor data   but there are episod  like the last coupl of week  when i get the sens that they can move fair rapid
i   m not sure i have that expertis   perhap the evolut of inflat expect is asymmetr  as presid   suggest   perhap it   s also what we look at at a high frequenc   inflat compens  sn   t exact map into inflat expect   it includ an inflat risk premium   we think that some of the rise in inflat compens is due to an unwind of someth we couldn   t explain   that is  a term premium that was veri low by histor standard  to the extent that it   s the term premium rise  it could get pack into that measur of inflat compens   i would also note that  as dave said  in the michigan survey of household  longer term inflat expect tick up   in the blue chip consensus forecast that   s releas today  longer term inflat expect are actual unchang over the last month  and that cover the span of the rise in energi price and the whiff of inflat jitter that we saw in financi market
the baselin  book forecast treat inflat expect as evolv relat sluggish  or are they capabl of jump
they   re capabl of jump   we could make the under assumpt that inflat expect have shift  and i think we would be look at the thing that i note earlier in tri to make that determin   in what we   re assum is current happen and what has happen over the past coupl of year  inflat expect are an evolv process  not a jump process
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to turn to the intern side and first thank   for the good work that   s in the book and your brief   more in the book than in the brief  there is the note that continu expans is take place among our signific trade partner and around the globe  i wonder if you have a sens  sinc we alway use the term    resourc util     of what global resourc util is occur   i rais this issu becaus we assum  for exampl  that the suppli of labor in china is infinit   if you read the recent data  you will see that in the pearl river valley price pressur on labor is up   wage are     yuan        a month  up from     a month   is it possibl for us  as we look at the rest of the world  to place a littl more emphasi not just on our net import or net export posit  not just on the pressur that come from import good in term of oil price  and not just on the growth factor  but also on develop a better sens of the kind of resourc util we   re begin to see  the second question i have is  sinc good have to get from point a to point b  do you have a sens of what   s happen with worldwid port capac and congest
well  as to the first question  we have not realli done a lot to address this issu  which you have rais with us befor  but we are tri to give it some thought   one thing struck me over the weekend  when governor kohn and i went to the bis governor meet   certain the sens of strong global growth was pervas and more forc among that group than i can rememb for a veri long  e  so  if i had the  book to do over again  i might push peopl to rais global growth a littl base on what i heard the other say at those meet  what we are observ in china is to some degre the result of deliber polici action that chines author have taken part to respond to the pressur they are under intern   they are seek way  way perhap not base on the exchang rate  to rais domest demand in china   among their concern about how to make that happen and deal with their own perceiv domest problem is the issu of migrat from the rural area into the urban area and the sourc of domest demand aris from the huge amount of popul that remain in the rural area   so they are look to keep peopl at home on the farm  so to speak  becaus it is attract to be home on the farm  and they are look to get the peopl home on the farm do more consum as a share of the total of china  to some degre they have succeed   through various tax and subsidi chang and other administr mean they have rais rural incom   one thing we have observ is veri respons behavior on the part of the chines popul so that  if the attract of be in one manufactur urban area chang relat to be in anoth  you see labor move in respons   now that you see someth of a chang  in general  between the manufactur urban area versus the rural area  you   re also see peopl will to go back home or to stay home in the rural area   that is a good sign that the labor forc alloc in china seem to be quit respons to what we think of as the normal econom incent that a market economi kick up   that said  it   suggest that the notion of a perfect elast horizont suppli curv of manufactur good out of china is a distort and that the curv has some slope to it   but  of cours  that is what we want  so we shouldn   t lament that outcom  over the weekend there was some interest in talk about how strong the global economi was and how much inflat might be around the corner  not just here  but everywher   nonetheless  report inflat in china is down  and most of the variabl in china   s inflat  as best one can tell  has been in food price   so what made chines inflat appear to go up was a food price event  and what has made chines inflat appear to come down is a food price event   i   m not sens that as yet there is a consequ of  say  this wage behavior or this relat incom pattern within china  in term of a veri big effect on the price at which the rest of the world can buy chines good or on the avail of those good   but it certain has the potenti to have such an effect  and it is someth for which we should tri to develop more sourc of inform
may i just interrupt you here to ask a question   in term of your bis read and what you came back feel   do you have a sens that global resourc util is tighten and that there is a greater inflationari impuls deriv from global resourc util
well  it is certain true that resourc util in certain industri countri   japan  for exampl   is move in that direct   even europ to some degre is move in that direct  for the major emerg market economi of india  china  and so forth  where we have seen the big increas in the global labor forc that has been thought to lie behind some of the downward pressur on wage everywher and some of the flat in finish good price  i am not so sure i did get a sens that we are reach some kind of capac constraint  if anyth  china surpris everybodi in q    the number that they releas are on a sort of q  to q  basi   we translat those intern and  therefor imperfect  into quarter on quarter chang  and so we have chines q  growth that is a        percent rate   i do not see ani sign that china is slow  the whole debat about a hard land in china is just gone   so in that sens  i do not realli see that we are hit global constraint where it most matter  we probabl do have a perman term of trade chang   or at least an extend  persist term of trade chang   in term of raw materi as a result of a chang in the composit of global growth  and i do not think the composit of global growth has to go back to be almost all industri countri with most emerg market countri bare grow   i do not see that happen   the countri that have enjoy term of trade gain becaus they have commod resourc are probabl go to continu to enjoy them  and what they do with those resourc  how they choos to consum them  or what they do with domest invest will becom  i think  an import factor in this notion of global capac  i do not have ani real new news on port capac  bottleneck  or ship rate  but sinc nobodi has been talk about these subject for quit some  e  i take no news to be good news  and i do not think bottleneck in that area have contribut much to what we have been see late
thank you   i think we are readi now to move on to our econom go round   let me remind you of our convent   rais one hand to be put into the queue to speak  and rais two hand if you would like to make an immedi intervent or ask a question pertain to one of your colleagu   s comment   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   incom data on the pace of econom activ surpris me slight to the upsid  although the indic are that hous is continu to cool   such an upsid surpris is of concern  given that we are probabl in the neighborhood of full employ and inflat is alreadi on the high side of a rang i consid consist with price stabil   i have also been slight surpris  and unpleas so  by incom data on core inflat  begin on the real side  recent data might signal greater under momentum in aggreg demand  portend more of the same go forward   but other develop dure the intermeet period portend slower growth this year   in particular  energi price and longer term interest rate have risen surpris and substanti   take all these factor into account  we have mark down our forecast for real gdp growth a bit for the latter half of      and for        we see growth come in slight below trend start in the second half of this year and the unemploy rate move up toward   percent   this forecast assum that polici is tighten at this meet and onc more over the next sever meet  one develop on which i would like to comment briefli is the rise in long term interest rate  sinc the begin of this year  the nomin ten year treasuri rate is up about    basi point   about    basi point of this increas is account for by a rise in the real compon  at least as measur by tip rate   it seem natur to assum that this increas in real long rate will restrain futur growth  but the outcom for econom activ is not unambigu   it depend on what caus real rate to rise in the first place  and the causat is far from obvious  for exampl  higher long term rate could reflect ration market expect of a signific stronger domest economi over the next few year   but such an explan   not strike me as particular plausibl becaus  although recent data are slight on the strong side  they are not dramat strong   moreov  the uptick in real rate appear to be especi pronounc in impli yield at the long end of the curv   in the distant futur  in period well beyond a plausibl forecast horizon  a second possibl is that higher u s  interest rate reflect a shift in global capit flow away from the unit state  perhap due to the unwind of the carri trade or grow concern about the u s  current account deficit   such a shift might account for the sharp drop in the dollar over the same period   in simpl model  such a shift in portfolio prefer has ambigu effect on domest demand becaus the depreci in the dollar could s ul aggreg demand by more than higher yield depress it   it   s not my intent to overemphas the risk that growth will not slow   my point is simpli that  although the rise in bond rate seem like to help slow the economi  we should not take it for grant  turn briefli to inflat  i   m uncertain whether the recent bulg reflect various special factor  as   mention  some pass through of energi and commod price  or pressur from resourc util   pars the cpi report  i found it difficult to discern evid that the uptick   reflect pass through of energi and commod price into core inflat   i would be quit concern if the uptick reflect pressur from resourc util and turn out to be persist   howev  half a dozen measur of slack that we monitor suggest no notic chang in slack sinc late march   these measur also suggest that we are in the vicin of full employ and not notic beyond it   data on both product and labor compens are larg reassur  my final comment concern the rise in inflat compens sinc our last meet   while the possibl of some loss of fed credibl certain can   t be dismiss  i believ we should not overreact   first  the rise we   ve seen is not out of line with the typic volatil in this seri   second  we must rememb that inflat compens includ not onli expect inflat but also an inflat risk premium   of cours  both of these element could be higher becaus of a lessen of credibl  but the inflat risk premium could also be higher becaus the world now strike market particip as a riskier place  perhap becaus of geopolit concern that have noth to do with credibl  inde  a grow percept that the world is riskier could explain both the uptick in inflat compens due to a rise in the inflat risk premium and some of the rise in tip yield due to higher real interest rate risk   factor analysi perform by our staff suggest a strong correl with the common factor for the term premium and longer horizon  but not shorter horizon  breakeven inflat rate and tip yield  my point is that determin what has caus inflat compens to go up is not an easi matter  and conclud that it   s due to a lessen of credibl may be prematur   so overal  while we have revis our core inflat forecast up slight  we continu to be fair op ist that inflat will remain reason well contain go forward   inflat in the core pce price index of around   percent over the next year or so seem like the most like outcom to us
do you or your staff have a view on the breakdown between the term premium and futur expect rate in term of the far forward increas in interest rate
we   ve not tri to es  an actual breakdown between those two thing   we do look at model that es  the term premium  but we   ve done some empir work that suggest simpli that movement in inflat compens  the inflat risk premium  and longer term tip yield tend to be correl at long horizon   but i don   t have an es  of that precis breakdown
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   our read on the fifth district   s economi veri much parallel those for the nation as a whole   i   ll be brief   survey show a mark pickup in manufactur shipment and order in march and april and ongo growth in servic activ  retail sale indic edg higher in april   the real estat market show sign that residenti activ is soften and commerci activ is firm  our measur of district price pressur have step up signific in recent week   in the servic sector  we ask about current price trend  and we get these quantit measur and rate of increas   in the servic sector  the current inflat measur is back up to it post katrina peak and is higher than at ani  e sinc        we ask about expect six month inflat   for the servic sector  that has drift up sinc katrina and is now at     percent  higher than at ani point sinc our survey began in the earli      s   in the manufactur sector  price receiv rose     percent  also a record high  and price paid also surg in april   the vast major of our contact who have comment on this believ that higher energi price will persist throughout       and about three quarter of them say that they will rais their price in respons  turn to the nation economi  on the real side the recent indic have been general upbeat and point to continu healthi growth   i won   t enumer them   unfortun  i think the inflat pictur has becom substanti more troubl to me over the intermeet period   the march number  as other have note  were certain eye catch   the core price index was up at an annual rate of     percent  even restrict attent to the market base compon that governor kohn prefer    laughter  of cours  month to month number are noisi  as   indic  but the core pce index was up at a rate of     percent over the past three month and     percent sinc august   in addit  the outlook for inflat go forward has deterior as well  and we have had a fair thorough discuss in the q a  so i   ll skip my plan recit of the indic   my sens is that inflat expect have deterior mark  i don   t want to be too alarmist   inflat spread are still a bit below where they were two year ago  so i think it is possibl to character inflat expect as contain  although the size of the requisit contain keep get bigger and bigger as  e goe on    laughter   right now it   s bigger than i   d like to see   my concern is less about the current level of expect inflat than it is about how those expect have respond to incom data   we saw an advers move in inflat expect last fall after katrina  accompani by conjectur that we might paus   inflat expect seem to subsid as retail gasolin price fell  but i think it help substanti that we stuck with our rate increas and communic pretti forc in the fall about our concern about inflat  this  e around  rise energi price have led to upward revis in market particip    expect about our polici path  along with upward revis to their expect regard inflat  i would have been far happier  howev  had they mark up their expect polici path by more and mark up their inflat expect by less  especi at longer horizon   i   m particular distress by instanc in the past sever week in which the two move in opposit direct   that is to say  inflat expect rose simultan with our expect polici path fall   presid   talk about overreact   certain no one want to overreact  but i think in situat like this a distinct reaction is warrant   thank you
presid    one issu i have with these survey is that  when they ask about price chang  they don   t distinguish between intermedi good and final good   of cours  the final good are what we care about   have you tri to make that distinct in your survey
yes  we do on the manufactur side   we have price paid and price receiv   in the servic sector  we don   t distinguish  we just ask   and we have separ retail and nonretail servic sector   on the manufactur side  they are alway pessimist  so price receiv never seem as though they   re go up as fast as price paid  especi in the last coupl of year   but over  e  if you look at their movement from month to month  you can get a distinct sens   they realli move up mark in the fall  taper off a littl and soften in the winter  and now have move up mark again and are at or abov where they were befor
thank you  mr  chairman   most of my busi contact indic that overal econom activ remain on a solid foot and that resourc util has tighten further  both of the major temporari help firm headquart in our district said that hire remain strong nationwid   they continu to say that skill worker are in short suppli   this topic was also on the mind of our contact in manufactur and construct   as i   ve note previous  we   ve heard a few report from manufactur that labor shortag were caus delay in supplier deliveri   strengthen labor demand  howev  has not yet spread to lower skill worker   so while wage for skill individu continu to increas brisk  pay rate for other worker are up onli modest  we   re also see sign of pressur on nonlabor resourc   some of our contact have run into problem with the cost and avail of truck and rail ship capac  and a manufactur of drill equip report suppli disrupt becaus it vendor were heavili backlog   sever contact note that price pressur have intensifi for mani commod  as we   ve discuss befor  of cours  everyon was talk about the surg in energi cost   some retail note that sale had slow  and they attribut the soft to higher energi price   other were concern about the impact of energi go forward   in contrast  our manufactur contact report that they general have no plan to scale back product in respons to the recent increas  there is not much new to report on the delphi negoti   the period for delphi worker to sign up for earli retir is just start   delphi  general motor  and the uaw hope that mani will accept the buyout   this would leav fewer union worker vulner to be laid off as delphi downsiz  which would make the negoti easier for all the parti involv  on a final note  sever of my director continu to be concern about the amount of liquid in financi market   they say price and term for more and more deal are border on specul  turn to the outlook  we   ve had quit a bit of news sinc our last meet   much of it suggest increas risk on the inflat front   of cours  the march read on core inflat was just one month  but the twelv month chang in core pce inflat is now back up to   percent   and as presid   said  the six month chang is now up to     percent   moreov  energi price have jump again   the dollar has weaken a bit more  and inflat expect have risen  in respons to the latest data  the forecast from our indic model of inflat have move up some   current  these project      core pce inflat between   percent and     percent   to be sure  thing are far from get out of hand   resourc util measur current are onli modest on the tight side  and we are all well awar of the uncertainti surround those measur   furthermor  the recent eci data suggest that wage pressur remain mute   that said  other measur of wage growth have been rise  look at the markup of price over labor cost  one would think that there   s plenti of room for profit margin to absorb higher wage   but as bill pool suggest in the issu we discuss befor  the busi peopl i talk to haven   t gotten that messag   their attempt to maintain margin in the face of increas cost repres an upsid risk to the inflat outlook   so i agre with the upward nudg to the  book inflat forecast  but i   d go a bit further   given the  book path for the fund rate  i think core inflat of    percent is a more reason point forecast for       in term of growth  the expans still appear solid   the soften in hous that we have been anticip is more obvious now   there   s a possibl that moder might turn to someth bigger  but i don   t see this as a larg risk   of cours     a gallon gasolin should restrain demand somewhat  and we   ll need to keep a close eye on how consum respond to yet anoth hit to their purchas power   but employ continu to rise at a good pace  generat healthi increas in incom  which should support household demand   busi are support spend on capit good  and growth prospect abroad continu to suggest some op  on export demand   so i think growth will averag around potenti over the cours of the project period

particular measur of inflat  which we consid to be a more reliabl indic of futur inflat   but the point is that  in all of our sound among these oper of busi  they are feel increas price pressur  both at the intermedi level and at the consum level  there are two littl indic that i found interest   one is that texa instrument  which usual has     or     job maximum outstand and look for high train engin  is now tri to fill       of those job and have troubl fill them   second  at the other end of the rang    eleven report that in florida  the great lake district  and the chesapeak bay area

it   s high integr  it   s a technic advanc machin that appar cannot help itself from exceed the speed limit    laughter   thank you
my husband will attest to that    laughter
presid    you don   t see ani drag from high interest rate or energi price on this overal strength
the two hous builder togeth built         home  as you know  that industri is consolid   i ask them point blank whether the rate are kill them   now  you have to take this with some skeptic  but they said no   the real issu here is that this high specul medium is becom incred liquid   there is obvious a self feed mechan  and the statist that probabl illustr it best is palm beach  florida   last year        home were list for sale   this year  as of last week         home are list for sale   so what you have is a secondari market that is be specul with  and advanc liquid provid by the financ mechan  and a lot of turmoil in that portfolio   this type of entrepreneur almost alway see thing as better than they actual are  and i do pay veri close attent to the kind of data that we   re see   but interest rate don   t seem to be the key issu  though obvious they kick in becaus of the way mortgag are price  as far as the consum is concern   and bill and i both talk to wal mart in depth   they are obvious more worri about gas price than they are about interest rate   so i have a bit of schizophrenia like        schizophrenia beat dine alon    laughter   we can alway talk to ourselv  when we can   t talk to anybodi els   the net feel is that growth is stronger than we   re forecast  and inflat   i agre with presid   and the other   is make me feel uncomfort
i   m still tri to understand that comment about the schizophrenia    laughter   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m not go to tri to help you on that one   laughter   i   m go to tri to be veri brief here becaus i want to reserv more of my fair share of the  e to the polici discuss  one of the problem with the anecdot report  of cours  is the unsystemat way in which we do them   i   m well awar that some of the answer you get depend on the way you phrase the question  some of my contact say that the economi is do fine  no real problem   one of my contact from the truck industri said that the economi look pretti stabl      bore normal    is the way he put it   i don   t have ani contact  though  who say that they see ani sign of weak   they   re not complain about sign of weak  and some of the contact are say that thing are pretti doggon strong   so that   s my attempt to filter the observ  now  let me just give you a coupl of particular interest anecdot   my wal mart contact talk about construct cost   he said even in indiana  which is not known as one of the great growth state in this countri
wait a minut   i have to make a two hand intervent on that one   laughter
okay   anyway  he said that their construct cost   for a store  i guess   have come in    percent abov expect   their construct cost are even higher in the gulf coast area  he also said that wal mart is in the process of rais start wage in about     store   this is the first  e in eight year of talk with him that i   ve heard ani comment like that   he said that some of the rais are part of the wal mart  i   ll call it    social polit     agenda becaus of all the controversi about wal mart   but he said about     of these were market driven  that they have plenti of labor in rural area and in urban area  but they are develop a labor suppli problem for their store in suburban area   suburban area are strong  i have receiv some unsolicit e mail messag   well  i guess to be fair they   re sort of solicit    laughter   these are from two director      heavi construct industri is realli hot   in the past month  i have receiv report of a second round of capit cost increas of    to    percent in the refin industri  and the same for construct of larg power plant   these es  follow similar increas last summer      anoth messag discuss pressur on the cost of construct materi   i won   t read the whole thing   it say     we believ we are now on the front side of a real surg in price that will main affect high volatil commod build product   steel  copper  aluminum  and zinc  howev  if it is sustain  it will rippl across a broad rang of more manufactur product     now  veri briefli  i   ve made a list of what i think are classic inflat warn sign  and i   ll just rattl these off veri quick   inflat expect   we   ve talk about that   dollar depreci  commod price are realli break out of a trade rang that has prevail for about fifteen year   if you look at the chart in the  book part    you   ll see that   the surg in construct cost   i think there is a build boom indic busi confid  and  of cours  a direct sourc of aggreg demand   relat low risk spread  make it easi for firm to rais capit   strong stock market  strong corpor profit   from our anecdot inform  some increas in price power   and a worldwid boom   there is growth in almost everi region of the world  and  of cours  that translat to some extent into price pressur everywher  includ good that we import and good that we export  at least eventu   i   ll stop there   thank you
presid pool  did your contact have anyth to say about the issu of whether the strength in retail sale was a season factor or someth els
wal mart  of cours  follow those number veri close   my contact said that it   s veri difficult to sort out what happen when ea  move the way it    particular this  e   he said he would just take march and april togeth   those two month togeth came in at     percent  same store comparison year over year  and they had     in their plan       versus       that came in just about exact as they had anticip   he did say that they are observ a clear respons to the gasolin price increas   they are see fewer trip to the store  a declin or less growth in the number of sale ticket  and an increas number of sale on each sale ticket  which is a logic thing for consum to do
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   current econom condit are fair to good in new england   consum report rise confid  at least in the current situat  manufactur report solid domest and intern demand   busi confid is also good relat to the current situat   unemploy claim and onlin job post suggest continu posit employ momentum   northern tier tourism was hurt by lacklust winter weather  but report tourism in boston has been quit strong   and even with the poor winter season  tax revenu have grown consider abov budget in all but rhode island  on the not so hot side  residenti real estat market appar have slow  particular at the high end  with rise inventori of unsold expens home   report  howev  more moder price home continu to sell  though transact volum for the region as a whole are trail off  averag sell price for singl famili home continu to increas accord to convent home price index  the last one of which we had for the final quarter of last year   more recent anecdot also suggest that they have been increas   howev  the rate of increas are down to singl digit  to some contact  the market  though slower  seem healthier and more realist  from a wide rang of contact i have spoken with sinc the last meet  i want to highlight three concern   first  rise cost for energi  transport  and raw materi are push price increas   these are more like to be toler by custom than in the recent past   and firm that say they are unabl to pass on such increas report that they expect consider bottom line deterior as a result   second  skill labor across a wide rang of industri is harder to find and expens  though plan overal wage increas do not seem to be larger than a year ago   so there is some issu here of skill labor versus unskil labor differenti   final  there is a general worri  despit pretti good current econom condit  that energi and energi relat cost will eat into consum demand and  combin with the flatten in hous market  will affect growth prospect  now  on the nation scene  our forecast is just about the same as the  book   s   growth slow for the rest of this year to next and in       is slight below potenti   unemploy rise slight  even with continu pretti good job growth   inflat first rise and then fall   it   s the same general forecast we   ve had for a while   but the question is where the risk to this forecast are   to me they seem to have risen  perhap on both side  but i   d say they   re a bit tilt to higher price growth   q  growth was clear abov expect   some of this was frontload into januari   april employ was on the slow side  there is some evid of slow in hous market  though price continu to rise  and household wealth  includ stock market wealth  is rise as well  the longer end of the yield curv has turn up  tighten financi condit somewhat  though corpor profit remain strong and credit spread remain narrow   it   s possibl we   re see consum spend slow  but busi spend has strengthen   thus  while the best guess is that the trajectori for growth is downward  how much and how fast remain uncertain and is a part more of the forecast than of the current pictur  on the other hand  although incom core inflat data have track onli a bit abov what we had expect  i   m not comfort with what might be call the inflat atmospher   with inflat compens and inflat expect rise  the dollar fall  and gasolin price around    a gallon  it seem to me that inflat risk realli have tilt somewhat   i know that each of these may turn out to be transitori   it   s also true that  as yet  indic of wage pressur have been mix  and while product growth has been trend lower  it remain quit healthi   the global competit that character much of the past ten year remain healthi  and profit margin are wide enough on averag to absorb the rise input cost relat to a grow world  still  anticip core pce price growth at     percent  as the  book   for this quarter  make me at least paus   given the six month and the three month rate of growth in core pce  a slow in rate of price growth  while expect  still is onli part of the forecast  in sum  although the forecast is rosi   perhap a bit too rosi   risk to the realiz of that forecast appear to have risen   some of these may be on the downsid  but we are also at a point where es  the economi   s remain capac is difficult  and the atmospher of the inflat pictur has chang   so though i don   t want to overreact or be accus of do so  i am less sure than i was at our last meet about both where we are and where we need to be

thank you  mr  chairman   base on the report from my director and my busi contact in the fourth district  the relat broad base growth of the first quarter appear to have carri over into april   howev  their comment about the balanc of the year are consist with the moder trend of the  book baselin project  to put it in term use by the confer board   s consum sen ent measur  the current condit index is high  but the expect index is fall   i was remind by my staff as we were prepar for this meet that real  e data on real econom growth are difficult to assess   at the end of our rate increas cycl in       the gdp figur were provid unreli signal about the under strength of the economi   we had a second quarter that had real growth of more than   percent   we were forecast  and even saw in the advanc figur a veri strong third quarter  and yet we had negat growth in that quarter  comment i hear about price pressur contain some mix messag   i don   t hear mani complaint about price pressur except for the obvious one about the energi relat cost and materi shortag in construct relat busi   howev  i am hear concern about the persist of these cost and the possibl that they may have negat consequ for both inflat and overal busi condit  the consequ of the energi shock for price are alreadi appar   at our novemb meet  i agre with the board staff project that we would  at about this  e  find ourselv face some pass through in our core inflat measur from some of the previous energi price increas   at that  e  howev  it also appear that headlin inflat would be come down at this point  obvious  the current  book suggest that recent oil shock have taken that scenario away from us  at least for the immedi futur  and the tick up in expect core inflat is now even further away from my comfort zone than befor  that said  base on what i   m hear from my director and busi contact  the  book   s assess of current condit and baselin project go forward seem about right to me   but i sens rather signific perceiv risk both that econom growth might turn out weaker than i expect and that inflationari pressur might be larger or even more persist than i expect   if we can take ani encourag from this  it would be that similar sen ent were express dure the run up in oil and gas price last fall  and those sen ent did abat fair quick when the energi market situat stabil   unlik mani of my colleagu who have spoken ahead of me  i do think that the risk are weight against both of our object  and  obvious  that   s not a comfort place for a monetari policymak to be in   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   let me start with our district   evid from the district continu to show strong growth   while consum spend has shown some modest slow  retail remain veri op ist in our survey about futur sale  and this despit some of the recent increas in energi price   manufactur activ continu to grow solid  and energi activ remain  of cours  veri strong in our area  with continu report of shortag of both labor and equip  hous market in the district are cool  as you   ve heard describ elsewher  and illustr i think a potenti downsid risk overal   though it   s still high by histor standard  residenti construct continu to edg downward   home sale were still grow modest in most area but not fast enough to absorb the suppli of home be brought on the market   as a result  first quarter inventori in the largest district market have grown mark relat to a year ago   in addit  foreclosur also point to some weaken in the hous market   i guess the most notabl is a    percent increas in march over the previous month that push colorado to the highest foreclosur rate in the nation   as report anyway   one factor behind the increas is the unusu widespread use of interest onli mortgag in that state   howev  nonresidenti construct in colorado and elsewher in the district appear to be take up some of the slack from the hous side  let me turn to the nation and tri to be brief   the contour of the outlook that we have are similar to what i report at our last meet and not unlik that from the  book   sever factor suggest that the economi will slow over the forecast period   first  as i   ve suggest befor  the remov of polici accommod continu to have it effect   second  long term interest rate have  as other report  risen notic   third  energi price continu to increas  reduc consum purchas power   final  we   ve been forecast a slowdown in hous  but there is a risk that the slowdown could be actual larger than expect  of cours  there are counterbalanc factor that would show continu growth   those have been outlin by other  but certain the past s ulus in the amount of liquid in the market has it effect   in addit  we are see improv in employ and in incom  which should help keep the economi move forward  on the inflat outlook  as other have note  the recent increas in inflat is a concern to me  but it is not a surpris   we have been expect last year   s increas in energi price to feed into a temporari rise in core inflat   we   ve seen that   more recent increas in energi are go to complic that situat  so in the end  as we prepar for the next portion of this discuss this morn  i would agre with all my colleagu on one thing   monetari polici is go to be much more difficult in the next few month    laughter
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  region data and anecdot inform from our various contact suggest that the southeast region economi continu to have good momentum   let me comment on just a few specif area where what we   re see in our district may help to inform our view of the larger nation economi  region employ gain continu to be strong  and we   re hear more and more stori of tighter labor market for a number of skill  most in construct and skill profession posit  and compens is go up signific in a number of those area   at the same  e  we also hear over and over about the length to which busi are go to offset those wage increas with product gain  most make greater use of technolog and process re engin  like other  we   re continu to see evid of cool in hous sale and price and a grow inventori of unsold home in some of our market   the ceo of one of the nation   s largest home builder  who is headquart in atlanta and with whom i talk regular  explain that a number of factor  in his view  have come togeth to precipit that slow   overbuild  higher mortgag rate  a retreat of hous specul  earlier convers of mani rental apart to for sale unit  and now the wait and see attitud among those who still expect to purchas at some point   he reinforc my sens that  while the cool off in hous is be felt to some extent in most market  so far it is onli the frothi coastal market  like south florida  that have seen a signific adjust  the high cost of energi and industri commod is veri much on peopl   s mind in our area  but the pass through of those cost still seem to be limit   clear  transport cost are up signific becaus of cost pass through   some construct project  includ a few that were substanti sold out in the preconstruct phase  are be cancel and deposit are be return becaus the construct materi cost would make project unprofit   an exampl of those cost pressur in construct   a larg builder told me last week that what he paid for copper wire most recent was four  e what he paid just a year ago  as an exampl of energi price pass through  one member of our small busi  agricultur  and labor advisori council relat a stori last week that is just too good not to share   he said he was at a neighborhood gas station  in the middl of fill the tank of his big suv  when the pump sudden stop across the entir gas station   an attend came on the speaker system and announc that they were institut an increas of ten cent a gallon   laughter   and the ringer is that the increas would appli not onli to the remaind of the gas he was about to pump but what he had alreadi pump    laughter   good stori   what i would call real  e pass through    laughter  while overal perform seem solid  the outlook is not near so bright in the hurrican affect area  with which we   re still struggl   the situat is especi difficult in new orlean  where the damag was due larg to flood and stand water  compar with the mississippi coast  where damag was due to storm surg and wind   debri cleanup and infrastructur repair still domin the reconstruct effort   even the demolit of damag structur in new orlean has bare begun  and there are few sign of ani rebuild in mani of the more heavili flood area of the citi   new orlean lost not onli more than         job but also about the same number of home  which were either destroy or suffer major damag   littl progress has been made in replac either the job or the home  and less than one half of the pre katrina popul is now back live in the citi  there are a number of reason for the lack of progress  includ complex leve repair  the need to redraw flood plain and set permit polici  polit in fight  a shortag of worker and suppli  and insur complic   just to mention a few   for instanc  the corp of engin  which has some     peopl work out of our new orlean fed offic  manag their project  expect to repair the leve system by june    which is the offici start of the new hurrican season   but those repair will bring the leve onli to their pre katrina status  and longer term solut and spend will take year to implement   even after eight month  oil and gas suppli still remain disrupt   just under    percent of crude oil and    percent of natur gas product in the gulf remain shut in  and the critic mar platform  which account for about    percent of that shut in  is still not up and run  critic to the slow recoveri process is the lack of hous for either return or temporari worker   without hous  the economi in the affect area will be slow to recov   there are practic realiti that also need to be face   peopl can   t continu to live in fema trailer forev  and those who are do so are begin to show sign of stress   we have twelv of our own employe in trailer in our park lot   we   ve come to the view  which i   ve talk about befor  that the experi from our past hurrican may provid littl guidanc about either the pace or the path of recoveri  we   re monitor develop veri care and also initi some research project to better understand the recoveri process  turn to the nation economi  i   m encourag that our collect forecast for a rebound in the first quarter was in fact on target  but i am less certain about the path go forward   i  like other  see both upsid and downsid risk to real output and employ   major downsid risk continu to be root in the possibl effect of energi cost increas on consum spend and busi cost  potenti consequ of a greater than anticip slowdown in hous  and the impact of both short term and longer term interest rate  which have risen  other key factor that could result in better than expect outcom lie in the potenti increas in invest spend  a surg in nonresidenti and commerci construct  continu strength in consum spend  particular in durabl and auto  and a pickup in inventori accumul   while my own staff   s forecast for this meet show a slowdown in the second half of the year  i   m not terribl confid about the specif sourc from which that slow will eventu come  of greater concern to me  howev  is the inflat outlook   the core measur continu to be in the upper rang of what most of us have indic is accept   the trend in these and headlin inflat measur are data that the public observ and that affect inflat expect  and it behoov us not to ignor them in favor of more benign forecast   i am  therefor  concern that we not do anyth today to suggest that we have lost focus on either inflat or the way in which we intend to achiev our inflat object   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   the district economi continu to perform well  and the ongo expans is broad base   given that summari  let me just comment on three particular area  begin with a few thing of interest that came out of a breakfast we had a coupl of week ago with the leader of the twin citi financi communiti  first  hire cost report are rise signific in order to attract colleg graduat and those with advanc degre   this has implic for salari more broad becaus of intern compress and retent issu   perhap not a surpris given the durat of the expans and the gain in employ over the past sever year  second  and this is larg by way of confirm thing that have been in the press late  distinct between the activ of commerci bank and much more special firm like hedg fund  ventur capitalist  and privat equiti firm are diminish  as the last group is invad the bank    turf  especi in provid credit of one form or anoth to busi   this was also a theme at a financi institut dinner i attend a few week earlier   these competit pressur may help to explain the result from the latest survey of senior loan offic indic further eas of standard and term for c i  commerci and industri  loan  the third area i want to comment on is hous   data through april show that activ in the district in term of start and permit is run so far this year at about the same pace that it ran last year  howev  accord to a varieti of anecdot report  specul build is slow dramat if not stop altogeth  and the high end of the hous market  interest enough  is do better  perhap far better  than the lower tier   there are report of price soften in the middl part of the market   given the volum of project that are current under way in the district  i would judg that the inventori of unsold home  especi of condominium  will continu to rise  and the pace of price increas will moder further  if not turn negat in some market  as to the nation economi  growth appear to me to be healthi and is like to be well sustain as best i can determin   still  i think that there are a few straw in the wind that suggest that some deceler is in the of  includ the evolut of hous activ and the diminut of the posit wealth effect  at least from that sourc   i do not want to exagger that effect at this moment   it is base larg on what we are see in the most recent data  but the anecdot  at least that i am get  are consist with that  also  while it seem pretti clear that the economi has weather the run up in energi price well  we should not lose sight of it negat implic for real incom and ul  for spend   as for inflat  here it seem to me that uncertainti about the outlook has increas  as the core number have come in a touch abov what i had earlier anticip   also  inflat expect appear to have deterior   still  in my experi  it is not a good idea to overemphas high frequenc observ  and as a consequ of that  i am not readi yet to rais my inflat forecast
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the basic contour of our forecast are essenti unchang sinc march and are veri similar to the  book   s   howev  the balanc of risk has chang a littl in our view  somewhat to the upsid on inflat   but as in march  we expect core pce inflat to run a littl over   percent in       and to moder slight below that in       as tighter polici work to slow overal demand growth   we expect real growth to rise in the vicin of it potenti rate           percent   throughout         so we are a littl higher than the  book in that sens  as befor  this forecast rest on some import assumpt   that littl or no slack is left in resourc util  that inflat expect are held in check  and that term premium remain relat low by histor standard   the recent move in medium term inflat expect and the rise in the other compon of forward interest rate cast some doubt on these last two assumpt   for these and other reason  we see a littl more uncertainti around our central forecast than we did in our last meet  howev  on the growth outlook  on balanc the recent data seem to confirm the pictur of real gdp moder toward potenti   we face the familiar sourc of risk to the downsid  but not all the risk are to the downsid   we may be underes  the momentum in final demand growth   i think it is import to note that it is hard to find evid in credit spread or in equiti price of a substanti growth slowdown in prospect  on inflat  recent develop are not all that dark  but neither have they been entir reassur   let me just go through the factor that we think are critic to the outlook on the inflat side  almost everi measur of under inflat that we look at is now abov the level we general associ with price stabil   headlin inflat has been run and is still run substanti abov core  and even with interest rate close to long run measur of equilibrium  the staff forecast   not anticip much moder in core inflat over the two year or even three year or four year period   compens growth   not yet appear to have acceler signific  and the growth of unit labor cost has remain reassur moder   howev  compens to us seem like to strengthen  and it is unlik that product growth is go to acceler signific from current level   demand growth is still probabl run a bit abov potenti here and in larg part of the world economi  with real short term rate still quit low around the world and monetari polici onli just begin to tighten in mani of those economi  global pressur on resourc util may intensifi or at least continu at it current intens rather than moder   and the rise in energi price and commod price  of cours  suggest a fair amount of strength in global demand  our assumpt that energi price follow the futur curv mean that our forecast is  of cours  still vulner as it has been over the past three year to further upsid surpris   it would be easier to discount this risk if we could determin with confid the extent to which temporari suppli factor rather than unrecogn or unanticip strength in global demand have account for the trajectori of energi price over the past few year  we face a lot of uncertainti about the like path of the dollar  and the prospect of a signific weaker dollar add anoth sourc of upsid risk to inflat and expect futur inflat   we obvious have some uncertainti about the extent to which margin will prove flexibl in the face of higher cost pressur  final  we have seen a materi rise in long term inflat expect in the unit state over the past sever month  and this should make us somewhat less confid that we can assum that the gap between headlin and core will be close with headlin move down to core   inflat expect seem to have risen more here than in other countri  and the recent chang in the relationship between chang in short term expect about u s  monetari polici and chang in breakeven inflat rate is somewhat disconcert  with expect deterior when statement by committe member were interpret as lower the probabl of move beyond our meet today   this pattern is more troubl than the size of the rise in medium term inflat expect   and i just want to make one comment in respons to someth   said   even if we could tell with confid how much of this rise in breakeven inflat was about uncertainti or inflat risk premium and how much was actual about futur expect about inflat and even if we thought a substanti amount of that was uncertainti  it is not clear that that would be particular reassur in term of credibl or in term of it implic for monetari polici  so under inflat is less contain than we would like it to be  and it is expect to moder less than we might hope   both short term and long term measur of expect have move up uncomfort  and we see somewhat greater upsid risk to our inflat forecast than we did in march  now  what might we learn over the next six week that would chang our view about the outlook and it implic for monetari polici   we actual think it is unlik that data are go to provid us with veri strong signal that polici is mark off track  but there are two import thing to watch   one is the behavior of long term inflat expect   if those expect were to continu to rise  that would obvious be a sourc of concern  and if inflat expect were not respons to chang in expect about the path of the fund rate  that would also be troubl   on the data front  we at least will want to watch to see if the expect moder in manufactur activ in the unit state materi   if  in contrast  manufactur activ here sustain it recent pace  it might suggest that growth abroad has pick up more than we thought or that the dollar is have a bigger effect in s ul export than we anticip   these condit would increas concern about upsid risk to our central forecast becaus  of cours  that forecast reli on a slowdown in overal domest demand growth mitig upward pressur on inflat over the forecast period  just a few point to end on the topic of uncertainti   even though the fundament news is pretti posit and reassur  we are now at the point where the limit of our knowledg about the under forc that affect the outlook for aggreg demand  suppli  and inflat matter more than they have in the recent past   relat small differ  differ well within the limit of our knowledg about trend growth and product or employ or other factor  have more impact on our choic about monetari polici in the near term than they would have had over the past two year  what should we conclud from the substanti rise in real forward rate that we have seen over the past few month   this move  which has occur across the major economi  bring expect real rate more in line with long term averag  reduc  if not elimin  the anomalist line we had such troubl understand   now    this mean we have less to do in term of futur tighten than we thought  mayb   or it might mean that monetari polici has been more s ul than we thought and that we will have to do more to make up for that go forward   the fact that we cannot fulli explain whi these measur of expect real rate have move around as much as they have just add to the uncertainti we face today about how tight polici actual is   it is also a bit of a puzzl that measur of uncertainti about futur interest rate have not increas veri much  and i do think it is import that we tri to continu encourag   it is uncomfort to say this   or to at least avoid discourag an increas in uncertainti that is more commensur with what we are experienc ourselv    laughter   monetari polici work through expect  but our job is harder when we are not truli sure what we want to do to those expect   tri to make sure that we are not push down uncertainti as we continu to make sure that the market understand that we   re go to work to keep inflat low and stabl remain our princip challeng   thank you
i will comment as well on tip spread  but those market are fair concentr  and therefor  liquid issu some  play a role in these high frequenc movement
i agre   i am not sure that the movement are that larg and that you can attribut that much to these differ  but i do think you want to look care at what happen to those expect when expect chang about monetari polici in the near term   it is that pattern which is somewhat disconcert
thank you  mr  chairman   mid may in an elect year is a good  e to look at the effect of the fiscal budget on the economi   in an elect year  ani legisl that has not larg move toward passag by memori day like is not go to happen   we have seen report of feder receipt receiv to this point  and we have a good idea about what the budget impact would be  the staff es  now is that the      budget deficit will be about      billion less than the origin es  of the administr   that would be equal to     percent of gdp in        compar with     percent in         the improv is larg revenu driven  as   indic  govern spend is up   through april  revenu are up    percent from       and  for april and may  up    percent over the previous year   reason for the increas will not be entir known for a while  but there are sever candid       and other suggest capit gain   although if you use as benchmark the distribut capit gain for mutual fund or the capit gain that may have result from stock market activ in        it seem unlik to be a strong candid   capit gain from real estat invest  given the exclus allow for coupl sell a primari resid  also is not a strong candid   so there are two other possibl   one is that the bea may be underes  the incom from sub s corpor that is pass through to individu tax return or from incom from partnership   anoth may be that there is a redistribut of incom toward the higher tax bracket and therefor the unavoid of the altern minimum tax   also  corpor incom tax are up again  indic the veri strong under economi  on the legisl front  we have a tax bill   an agreement was reach on a tax reconcili bill  it push out one more year the altern minimum tax that expir in      and extend for two more year the lower rate on dividend and capit gain set to expir in        there will be a second tax bill that is right now tie to the pension reform bill   a supplement appropri bill has pass the hous and the senat   the hous version is at     billion  the senat version       billion   the presid has indic that he would veto the senat version should it move forward   that would be his first veto dure his term as presid   there is no indic whatsoev that ani portion of the presid   s tax panel   s report from last fall will be realiz in ani tax legisl soon or be an issu in the      elect   that is not a surpris   the tax panel member last fall indic that  becaus of the  e of it releas  the report was unlik to generat legisl  and they specif did not put the report in legisl languag  indic that they instead want to talk more broad about tax polici  budget resolut have pass the senat but not the hous   the hous is still debat the level of the budget resolut they would want to pass for         there is more focus in this congress than we have seen recent on budget issu   the focus is not driven by ani effort whatsoev to reimpos  for exampl  a paygo provis  but the earmark process that had basic hijack the appropri process and generat some focus on road to nowher and bridg to nowher has brought about a rethink in some quarter as to whether or not there ought to be renew budget focus  overal  the net effect is that both spend and revenu in       and probabl       will be back to their fifti year averag  which is to say about    percent of gdp on the revenu side and    percent on the spend side  although the swing obvious from year to year have been veri dramat   thus  in the near term  there will not be a surpris effect on the budget and therefor on the economi   howev  the report that was issu this week by the truste of medicar and social secur revis onli slight the  e frame within which those two spend area will overwhelm the budget if not ul  address   and there is no indic that will happen   that is the report from the congression side for now
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with mani of the rest of you that inflat risk rose over the intermeet period  though i think i see a more limit rise than i sens from some of the comment i have heard   sever factor do suggest higher inflat risk   stronger growth than expect has left resourc util a littl higher than we thought   onli a touch  i think  but still higher   the core cpi and pce data were disappoint   were higher than anticip   that  howev  did follow sever month in which those data came in lower than we had expect   and if you look at the  book   s      project  it revers a downward revis from last  e   that is not to say it is not worrisom  but we were revis down for a while  and now we have had an upward revis  i think the commod price increas are hard to understand  especi outsid the energi area  where you can think about suppli disrupt   both the energi price and the commod price could feed through to a limit extent into headlin inflat   i think they do indic  at the veri least  that global demand has continu to be quit strong   in that regard  they would add to global inflat risk  the declin in the dollar is a bit worrisom   the pass through to import price has been veri  veri small over recent decad   but to the extent that the lower dollar is not pass through to import price  it would be squeez the profit of those peopl who are export to the unit state  and i think  through either channel  this suggest at least a slight reduct in the competit pressur on domest produc   not big  but a slight reduct  we did have a small uptick in inflat expect look at through the market or the michigan survey   howev  those expect are still in the rang of recent year  and i can recal a number of occas post katrina and in the last few spring in which they have tick up in similar situat and then come back down again  particular after energi price level out  none of these sign of higher inflat are veri signific in and of themselv or if they were taken one by one  but taken togeth  they cannot be dismiss   they do suggest at least a small rise in inflat expect and a small rise in inflat risk that could start push up under inflat further  that said  the data we have receiv over the intermeet period should give us a littl more confid that condit are be put in place or are in train to limit these risk and to keep the upsid risk limit   the trajectori of inform over the intermeet period  especi on consumpt and hous  point to quit a bit of moder of growth in the second quarter   we are look at   point someth  and the issu is what the point someth is  it is not   point someth or   point someth  hous market inform  i think  confirm that there is a slowdown in process that will restrain aggreg demand go forward   sale have bounc around a lot  but inventori have risen substanti by ani measur   that is go to be weigh on price   the price data are ambigu and hard to read   if you take a heroic leap and start season adjust the exist hous price on a month by month basi instead of a twelv month basi  it look as though they have been flatten out   but we will get better data later   if  inde  price are flatten out  we have not yet realli seen that effect on consumpt   so in that sens  the tighten of polici and the flatten out of hous price are still in the pipelin  higher long term interest rate   some of that increas is an endogen respons to global growth and would requir a higher path of short term rate to keep inflat under control  but some of it is in the risk premium   the extent to which the risk premium has risen will damp demand for ani given cours of monetari polici   the energi price increas will contribut to moder growth of domest demand  provid that we do not allow that energi price increas to reduc real interest rate  like some other here  i am kind of encourag by the data on labor compens   they are mix  but i have interpret them on balanc to suggest that pressur on busi from labor cost develop are mute   the eci is certain consist with that  and so are four quarter chang in compens per hour and unit labor cost   the markup of price over unit labor cost actual increas from a veri high level to an even higher level   i agre with presid pool that busi will not voluntarili give up that markup  but we do have a recent experi if you look in the late      s   that markup peak at the end of        i believ  and drop veri  veri sharpli in       and        despit the fact that the economi was grow with some vigor   you can see that on page    of the  book   so perhap we need to think about that episod and how it happen   certain we have a preced for vigor growth and declin markup absorb rise compens cost  so where   that leav me overal   i agre with the staff   the most like outcom   given the structur of interest rate  financi condit  market  and a flatten of energi price   is for stabl under inflat  core pce to stay in the neighborhood of   percent  where it has been sinc earli       but i am a littl more nervous about the stabil than i was at the last meet   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for the meet  one of the thing i focus on was the graph that i like that track the staff forecast over  e becaus i am realli torn between where i see growth go and where i see inflat expect   in look at the graph  one can clear see  if you look back through  book to septemb        that staff forecast of core pce inflat have been basic flat wherea real gdp growth forecast for this year have increas quit a bit   the       number are stabl at a lower inflat rate and a lower growth rate  but what troubl me so much  and somebodi alreadi mention it  is how much the various indic of core inflat have pick up over recent period in the actual data   as presid   mention  we have core pce up     percent in the past coupl of quarter   we have core cpi up     percent   if you look at core gdp price over the whole of last year  you are run at just under   percent over that period  and that is without what we cannot quit measur yet  which is how much energi price are pass through   the longer compani see that energi price are go to remain high or go even higher   instead of be just a one shot hurrican effect   the more like we are to see some of these price be pass through   so i am get concern about whether the lag effect of the monetari polici chang so far are go to be enough to moder the inflat that we are now observ to reach the goal of lower core inflat number in        on the real side  one area that i think is critic is the hous market   as you all know  i have continu to worri about what is go on in hous and mortgag and have want to give you anoth perspect on what we are observ   most of you are well awar that we put out some supervisori guidanc for comment awhil back on nontradit mortgag loan  which includ various form of interest onli  adjust rate  negat amort mortgag   if you look at the      earn report of the larg mortgag bank and the larg save and loan that do mortgag lend  these institut have a realli strike amount of interest rate risk embed in their negat amort loan   as you know  most of the product is securit and sold   so the relat share of these product origin in the last coupl of year that are on the bank    book is small overal   but the number have gotten so bad that now the setter of account standard want bank to disclos how much interest incom they are recogn as incom that they have not collect  through this negat amort   in other word  they bill the custom for this interest  but instead of make the custom give them the cash everi month  they just add the amount to the outstand balanc and it creat negat amort   for some of these big organ  the amount repres   or    percent of net incom from last year   so the number is grow  and we are look to make sure that bank are appropri put asid reserv for the portion that may not be collect  in the past few week  i have becom awar that the rise interest rate are creat more problem for custom in servic debt   what presid hoenig has observ in colorado in interest onli adjust rate mortgag is just the begin   the  book show how much the subprim sector is go up  and we know  becaus arm are a big chunk of those mortgag  that it is start to be felt   as we go forward and more of these arm  especi those that have three year lock in period  start to repric  we will be see more of it  now  the mortgag industri  ever creativ and ever worri about the abil of homeown to pay amid rise rate  has now decid to creat negat amort  fix rate mortgag   what these mortgag do is say     just borrow for your hous   you have a month payment  no amort of princip  and you do not even have to pay the full fix rate   we will just continu to add to your princip  and you pay what you can afford everi month versus what you realli owe us on the fix rate everi month      this process just continu  and one thing that bother me for the long run is the extent to which hous could slow this year and slow the economi   i just wonder about the consum   s abil to absorb shock   the buildup of home equiti and the abil to borrow against it have help individu homeown when they have had layoff  medic problem  divorc   all the thing in life that creat month to month problem for cash flow   with the growth of negat amort  home equiti is not be built up anymor   negat amort clear help consum spend becaus consum  in effect  have a smaller amount of their take home pay that has to go to the mortgag payment everi month  and so it is avail to be spent elsewher   it is probabl a more pernici type of home equiti withdraw becaus you don   t take an action to withdraw it   now it is plan that you will have negat amort   it clear chang the way we look at the role of save as a precautionari balanc to get the consum through bad  e  and it also has long run implic regard the import of asset valu vis  vis default rate both for the bank sector and for the household sector  so the grow ingenu in the mortgag sector is make me more nervous as we go forward in this cycl  rather than comfort that we have learn a lesson   some of the model the bank are use clear were built in  e of fall interest rate and rise hous price   it is not clear what may happen when either of those trend turn around
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i hesit to joke here at my second fomc   i made a joke at my first that the inaugur meet requir the new governor to sing  and my colleagu took me up on that    laughter   so i will not offer a joke about danc this  e    laughter   in the interest of  e   laughter  go to the central tendenc in term of where the economi is  i suppos i consid myself much more op ist than the  book forecast about the state of the economi   i think some of the shock to the economi  energi price be the latest  speak in some way to the durabl  the flexibl  and the resili of this economi which  on the one hand  i shake my head about but  on the other hand  i think we have to believ to some degre  i will not go into too mani of the fact  which have alreadi been describ  but consumpt was up     percent in the first quarter   busi capit expenditur were up about      percent on an annual basi  with strong durabl good order   and the increas in tax receipt that governor olson spoke about is a veri good lead indic  even though some of the detail behind that increas are hard to know  presid pool referenc the growth in corpor profit   let me add a coupl of note on that  what we are realli see in the equiti capit market is  by and larg  profit driven growth in the s p and in the dow as oppos to some sort of p e multipl expans   it   give some of us more confid in the strength that we are see in the equiti capit market as well as anoth sourc of op  as to what some of the incom statement benefit might be to consum  as we think about what might be the eleph in the market  certain the hous market is one from fomc meet that preced my  e here   the new eleph in the market in term of tone and tenor are inflat and inflat expect   i would like to talk about them more in just a moment  when we look at the data sinc our last meet  though there is a lot of nois  on balanc i share the view that they tend to be more posit than expect   averag nonfarm payrol growth in the past six month was almost          includ the april figur  and the idea of less robust labor market appear beli by the solid gain that we have seen in hour work  the acceler in wage  and the low unemploy rate  which is still at     percent   so our think about a possibl slowdown in the second half of the year has to at least be balanc or perhap part counterbalanc by what could be the first meaning gain in take home pay for nonsupervisori worker   understand those incom statement benefit to real consum is probabl a more certain exercis at this point than tri to figur out the effect on the consum of the hous market  which governor bie spoke about  on the busi front  i am at least as op ist as i was six week ago about the state of busi invest   ceo  when they have seen the appreci of share price in the last quarter  even as they have seen price appreci for mani of their competitor  remain more robust  more excit  and  i think  more eager to spend money  we have seen an increas in the backlog in debt underwrit by most of the big bulg bracket firm  and so though some of that money is  no doubt  be spent on stock repurchas  some debt is be rais in expect of merger and acquisit activ   at least part of it is base on a view that  as there is more uncertainti price in the market for the second half  compani are get their duck in a row to obtain some extra liquid  let me make one final point befor briefli talk about inflat   i am encourag  like the rest of you  about the synchron global growth that we are talk about   my biggest concern  particular in may of an elect year  is about what is like to be a bipartisan foray into creep protection in the dialogu of politician here in washington between now and the novemb elect   the posit discuss about free trade that we have heard on both side of the aisl over the past sever year are  i think  go to diminish veri signific   there could also be mani more discuss in high contest congression elect district about the need to isol the u s  market  to cut ourselv off from a lot of foreign opportun   to be candid  the busi communiti probabl isn   t that eager to enter this debat with a messag orient toward free trade   so i do think that creep protection may becom stronger between now and novemb and will have consequ for our economi to integr with foreign market and to continu to expand   we may have more difficulti fight back in some of the export market  even with some depreci of the dollar   the feder reserv has a possibl role in tri to moder some of that discuss  final  just a moment on inflat   i guess the way i would character it from a market perspect  and i think this is consist with dino   s and the vice chairman   s comment  is that market expect of inflat are more fragil than they were some month ago   i would not describ myself as an alarmist about that   howev  the trader at mani of the secur firm and the folk who are hit the trade button are contemporari of mine   they are from a generat that has not experienc inflat at first hand the way that some folk around this tabl have   the psycholog point of that statement is that  though we may have seen some laxiti in their concern about inflat over the preced six month and even today  that laxiti could turn into some irrat if inflat expect get abov our reason expect and our comfort level   on balanc  i think that the market  particular those margin trader  are look for some leadership from the feder reserv   perhap we have seen somewhat less market disciplin in the tip market and in some of the other market  such as commod   other folk have spoken more eloqu than i about what is happen in the tip market and some of the danger sign in the survey  so i will onli offer two final note  first  on the energi market side and on the commod side  it is harder and harder to describ the run up in price as sole or even predomin demand driven   when i think about the new retail product that are now find their way to typic broker   dealer relationship at retail orient chain  i see a massiv surg of inflow into new silver orient mutual fund and copper orient exchang trade fund   a lot of that specul money is come veri late into these market  and that situat should suggest to us that some folk  right or wrong  are assign some sort of inflat hedg to that product  with retail investor  as usual  be the last to get in on it  final  on the energi front  i have been think about the differ between where we are now and where we might be sever month from now   i was encourag by the same store sale number that we saw in april  even in march and april togeth   those number are veri encourag  but as we get into the summer drive season  the energi price may be seen as persist   the market may take a view that the higher price are more perman than most consum believ now  and i think that   s probabl an extra reason for our caution on the inflat front   so on balanc  mr  chairman  i am quit op ist about the strength of the economi but at least as leeri about the expect for inflat go forward
it worri me that we are in the hand of some exuber    year old    laughter
he had to rub it in    laughter
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   you will hear me sing a familiar song from last  e  although not exact the same song  and unfortun i did forget my tap shoe   the song that i want to sing from last  e is the continu strength and resili of the economi plus concern about inflat expect move out of line  consumpt growth has been moder a bit  but exact as governor olson said  with the continu of some of the chang in the tax law  real dispos incom will still have a boost   we have seen veri strong global demand  particular on the consumpt side in mani countri that have been lag in consumpt   in addit  we are also see strong invest demand  both domest and intern  and i think that is someth that we have to take into account go forward  as for the key risk go forward  one  of cours  is the hous market   there has been a lot of discuss of that  and i do not think i have veri much more to add   we have to see what the lag effect of interest rate chang are there  but that is someth to be determin  some puzzl that have persist sinc last  e concern the lack of pass through of a number of thing   of the heighten energi and commod price to core inflat  we have seen some uptick   but i share governor kohn   s analysi  or his conclus from the analysi  that there are some sign but that one should not be over wari becaus we have had a bit of downtick  then a bit of uptick   when we are talk about month movement of     percent  a simpl round error can make thing seem sudden much higher or much lower   it could be a    percent differ from what we expect when we realli are just see a round error  although we do have to be veri awar of this  obvious  we have not seen pass through of higher product gain to compens   this situat puzzl me quit a bit becaus  histor  by now we would be see more robust of compens  not just real dispos incom  but compens   we have not seen that   product appar continu to move fair strong   look forward  i am concern about this area even though the current data seem to suggest that the cost of labor are perfect reason   rather than look just at the current data but use a littl theori to look forward suggest that this may be an area that could be come up in the futur  even if there are higher cost in the labor market  are they go to be push through to final demand price   we have had a good discuss of the evid on what has happen in the past   will you necessarili see the margin stay up or move down  and will that caus the chang in under cost to be pass forward   potenti it won   t  and potenti there could be larg movement   but  again  we are in somewhat unchart territori   we do not have a lot of evid here  anoth set of puzzl concern the yield curv term premium  and we  of cours  have alreadi had a lot of discuss about those and about the slight uptick in both the survey base and market base measur of inflat expect   obvious  that is someth that we need to be veri  veri concern about becaus the last thing that we want is to allow our action in ani way to be interpret as a lack of concern about inflat  which could lead to an unanchor of inflat expect   that said  i certain do not see such unanchor in the market   also  the yield curv  although it has certain move up from be flat or even slight negat  is still show a differ between the two year and the ten year of onli       basi point  which is not veri larg   and the much flatter yield curv are a worldwid phenomenon  driven by factor not just within the unit state and not just about u s  expect  i also veri much agre with presid  n that we should not put too much emphasi on high frequenc number   we have to think about the recent number in a more systemat way   what are we like to see go forward   what are the risk go forward  given some theori  given some histor experi  come back to the theme that i sang about last  e   about fed credibl not be the imposs dream  but a realiti   i think we do have that realiti  and it is certain someth we do not want to give up   just to tweak presid   a bit  i hope his comment should not be interpret as say that we want to introduc uncertainti into the marketplac   the last thing that the fomc should be do is introduc uncertainti   certain we do not want to be produc moral hazard and have inappropri low uncertainti when real risk factor may be out there   we certain want to be veri wari of that  we do not want to contribut to that   but as   said  and i veri much agre  we are in a veri uncertain  e  and to suggest that we are uncertain about where the economi is go is valuabl   but to suggest that the market particip are not focus enough on uncertainti  that there should be more uncertainti  and that we should do someth about it is perhap not the way to go   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  and thank you all for your veri concis comment   laughter   we will take a fifteen minut coffe break   coffe break
at this point i would normal tri to summar the remark around the tabl   but sinc you have all just heard them and sinc my own view are not terribl differ from mani who have spoken  i think in the interest of  e i will just go ahead and talk briefli on my own behalf about what i see the economi do  and then we will turn to the polici go round  first of all  with respect to growth  i think we are follow the path laid out by the  book toward greater moder in the second half   the main differ is that  sinc our last meet  the uncertainti around that prospect path has increas   obvious  the key to this moder is the hous market  and fundament analysi would suggest that the combin of high price and rise interest rate would make afford a problem and would bring hous start and hous price down  so far we are see  at worst  an order declin in the hous market  but there is still  i think  a lot to be seen as to whether the hous market will declin slowli or more quick   as i note last  e  some correct in this market is a healthi thing  and our goal should not be to tri to prevent that correct but rather to ensur that the correct   not over influenc growth in the rest of the economi  i would also note that there are go to be some offset to the declin in residenti invest  we   ve note increas in nonresidenti construct  which is about half the size  as a share of gdp  of residenti construct and  in term of contribut to gdp  could make up someth like a half of the direct impact of a declin in residenti spend   we also have gotten a sens that capit spend is relat strong  and world growth is also strong  which may enhanc our export   so there are some countervail factor to help cushion the presum declin in the hous market  but as we talk about the hous market  which is   percent of gdp  or nonresidenti construct  which is     percent of gdp  we have to pay veri close attent to consumpt  which is    percent of gdp and which realli is the center of the forecast for the rest of the year   the soft land scenario view in the  book requir that consumpt grow the rest of the year at someth around     percent  which is rough what it has been do in the last year or so on averag   i think that is broad plausibl  there are factor on both side of it   support consumpt  obvious  are some increas in compens like come forward both in term of hour wage and in term of hour work  job avail  and to some extent mayb increas in stock price   on the negat side  mani peopl have point out the effect of rise interest rate and soften in hous price   energi is actual a bit of a mix bag   energi price are obvious a negat for consumpt in level term  but we have had a big drag on consumpt for the past two year from increas energi price  and so if energi price do stabil  the drag will actual be less in      than in previous year   so  again  i do think that the slowdown that has been forecast by the  book is plausibl  but like a number of peopl around the tabl  i would note that so far it is larg a prospect slowdown and that the data have onli begun to support that develop  on the inflat side  i have somewhat more concern  like a number of peopl   core inflat has been remark stabl  and i do not think it is go to rise veri much  but to the extent that there are risk  they are veri larg to the upsid   and i also have some concern about the possibl emerg of some inflat psycholog  which is a veri negat thing for our policymak   the factor that support higher inflat are well known   first  energi and commod price   i would point out that  rather than be transitori  they have now undergon a long  sustain increas  which evid must at some point get into the cost structur of firm   second  the weaken dollar over the past month or so may be suffici to add some pressur   third  the effect of compens  i understand  is a littl ambigu   there are some factor work in the other direct  includ markup and product  but clear the sens around the tabl is that compens is begin to move up somewhat  and the risk there i think are also to the upsid   final  it is worth note that  at a technic level  some of the compon of the inflat index are move upward   in particular  owner    equival rent   it econom make sens that  if hous price have risen so much  rent will begin to rise   sinc that is a veri larg share of both the cpi and the pce core measur  that is go to be an upsid risk for us  now  again  i do not want to overst the problem   i think that core inflat will remain contain  to use our languag  but i am concern about those risk   clear  the market have seen a strengthen of the economi and increas inflat risk   despit all of our communic and languag  it is summar by an increas of about    basi point in where they think the feder fund rate is go to end up later this year   we have seen and alreadi discuss the increas in inflat compens and in other measur of inflat expect   much of our confid that the pass through from energi  from the dollar  and from labor cost to final good inflat will be low is predic on the view that inflat expect are low and well contain   when that premis begin to break down  then all the other element of the analysi also begin to come under pressur  final  as a number of peopl have note  although we do not have an offici definit of price stabil  we are at the upper level of what might plausibl be call the region of price stabil  and further increas will be difficult and potenti cost to revers   so look forward to the polici discuss  i think we are go to have to take into account the emerg inflat risk   at the same  e  there is an aw lot of uncertainti about what is go on in the economi   it is go to be a difficult balanc act to tri to maintain as much flexibl as possibl so that polici can respond to new data as they arriv   at this point i would like to turn over the floor to    who will talk about the polici option  thank you  mr  chairman   over the intermeet period  the data
came in stronger than the tone of the committe   s deliber in march would have led ani listen to suspect   as a result  committe communic that reflect that discuss   includ the minut  speech by some of you  and the chairman   s tes oni   tend to pull down the expect of futur polici action  plot in the top panel of your first exhibit  even as data releas tend to push them up   on net  the data won  and the path of polici expect  the middl left panel  rotat up    to    basi point   the term structur of nomin treasuri yield also rotat up  impli increas in nomin forward rate  the blue bar in the middl right panel  of    to    basi point   these gain outstrip the rise in real forward rate  the   bar  result in signific increas in inflat compens  the differ in the height of the bar   inflat compens over the next five to ten year is plot in the bottom panel  how you interpret these movement is like a critic element in your polici choic today  on the one hand  the recent rise in inflat compens  the shade yellow area  has not move it notic abov it rang of variat in the past two year   inde  at    percent  forward inflat compens is lower than at  e when the committe describ inflat or inflat expect in previous polici statement as    contain    or    well contain     the blue shade area   if you think that is still the case  then you also probabl believ that you have scope to be patient in polici set  on the other hand  if you focus on the    basi point rise over the intermeet period  you might conclud that there   s been a partial outbreak of inflat jitter   not a pandem  mind you  but the first instanc of trader to trader transmiss    laughter   the anti virus typic prescrib is a vigor assert of your willing to tighten polici   other evid of possibl inflat concern is the subject cover at the top of your next exhibit   from left to right  survey measur of household inflat expect have move up for both near term and longer term horizon  and the valu of the dollar has fallen sharpli on foreign exchang market   it might be that financi market particip place some weight on domest spend retain consider momentum  put pressur on resourc   one such scenario was play out in the  book and is summar in the   the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     middl panel   in the    domest boom    altern scenario  the growth of spend   not moder much   perhap becaus a slow in hous price appreci   not materi and firm begin to dip into their ampl cash coffer to fund invest   inflat differ littl from the baselin  but that is  in part  becaus polici respond  rais the nomin fund rate to    percent   as in the dash line at the right   this provid an opportun to repeat a point made at monday   s brief   such an action would be inconsist with current market expect in that it would place the rate at the top of the    percent confid band impli by option price  the blue span    but our understand of the economi   as encapsul in stochast simul of the frb us model   is suffici imprecis  the   rang  that such an outcom shouldn   t be all that surpris   speak of surpris  a major object to tighten    basi point at this meet to show your anti inflat resolv  as in altern c of the bluebook  is that it would catch market particip unawar   inde  as shown in the bottom panel  it would be the biggest surpris of the modern era of fomc announc  at least as measur from futur market read just befor the statement had been releas   in contrast  the    basi point action discuss in exhibit   is exact what the market is look for   moreov  the staff project that the economi will hit what you might consid to be a sweet spot  with the unemploy rate  the top left panel  zero in on it natur rate and core pce inflat  the top right  reced to   percent   that forecast is predic on firm action today and none thereaft   altern b in the bluebook was structur to accompani such an action with the messag that there is some chanc that you might be done today  but you might not   as can be seen in the middl left panel  energi price have move up sharpli  which pose the classic tension of drag down spend while impart some lift to inflat   in that regard  the relationship between chang in energi price and core inflat   as at the middl right   has been tenuous at best over the past twenti year  suggest you might prefer to focus more on the consequ of the oil shock on aggreg demand than inflat   if so  you might view that sourc of addit restraint as a substitut for further monetari polici firm   a   point hike today will bring the real feder fund rate  the solid line in the bottom panel  toward the high end of the rang of es  of it equilibrium   anoth reason you might view yourself as done  or at least close to done   inde  if you give credenc to the simul present in the bluebook you might view yourself as alreadi done  which is whi we includ altern a  the subject of exhibit     if you have an inflat goal of   percent and agre with the staff assess that the equilibrium real rate is around    percent  then the current nomin fund rate of    percent probabl has a lot of appeal   when we ran simul of the version of the frb us model in which market particip are forward look  hold the fund rate at     as in the top left panel  instead of tighten some and back off a bit later    not matter much for the path of the unemploy rate and inflat  the bottom panel    thus  from the perspect offer by the staff model  you can go home now and not come back until the next decad  which by the way will make the work of governor kohn   s subcommitte easier    laughter   your last exhibit give altern statement languag  where the item in red denot new word relat to the march statement and those in blue repres chang relat to what you saw in the bluebook   some concern was express that altern b did not convey suffici concern about inflat risk  so we   ve tighten it up somewhat   as can be seen  this altern  first  stress that current econom growth is quit strong  row     second  in row   it now simpli repeat the march languag verba   and third  it drop the word    modest    in refer to the outlook for polici firm   one last one word chang did not get onto the tabl   in the second sentenc of row    we   re propos to go back to the march languag and refer to a growth as    like to moder to a more sustain pace    instead of    toward a more sustain pace      that conclud my prepar remark
thank you      are there ani question for     if not  i hope we can have a go round and have peopl   s view on the polici   presid
as i said befor  i think we are essenti okay on the real side  but my concern have risen about inflat   i recogn the potenti for slowdown later this year  but my sens is that our inflat problem is much more of an immedi issu for us   i think we have to take serious the possibl that inflat expect might deterior further even though  as vinc said  they are within the band that we have character as contain   my sens is that ani statement today that move the market   s expect polici path down is go to caus inflat expect to move up   that   s my bottom line today  and i think we should strive to avoid that  second  and here i will echo someth i said and someth the vice chair said  i am veri unhappi with the way in which market have react over the past sever week   as i said earlier  market mark up their expect polici path but also mark up expect inflat   it would have been better  in my view  if they had mark up the polici path more and the inflat path less   i just do not see the util of the market   s believ in a reaction function for us that has oil price shock push core inflat materi higher when they occur  our statement today is an import opportun to influenc the public   s understand of our reaction function  and that is the len i am use to think about polici today   it is fine to say that polici is go to be data depend  but it is import how the public believ our polici is go to depend on the incom data   unfortun  we are at a difficult point here   the public is suspect that a paus might be immin  and so increas the statement   s emphasi on data depend is like to increas the probabl they assign to a paus and thus bring down the yield curv   as i said  i think that would be a mistak   we need to strengthen the public sens of how strong we intend to respond to increas in core inflat   so this has to do with the slope of the reaction function   ul  the data depend that the market expect is go to be inform by the data depend that the market actual see   this is whi i propos in my memo on friday that we modifi row   in altern b to place more emphasi on inflat risk   the way it is word in the version that vinc just circul   that veri well   in fact  better than i did   but in ani event  whatev we do  we should strive to make sure our statement   not bring down the expect polici
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i have some note   i do not usual write them out  but i have them written out today  first  let me say that i agre with the comment that governor   made awhil back that the economi is strong and has excel growth prospect   the economi is not fragil  and our job  of cours  is to keep it that way   our interest rate polici should depend on the state of the real economi and not just on the inflat threat   in the model with contain actual and expect inflat  the real rate of interest would fluctuat with the state of the economi   given the worldwid integr of capit market  what is relev is the state not just of the u s  economi but also of the world economi   the fed fund rate target should depend on the gdp gap even though the predict valu of the gap for inflat is low   this is a messag that market ought to hear becaus monetari polici must be respons both to the state of the real economi and to inflat risk  now  as for the lag in monetari polici effect  which i think is an import part of the concern that we will overstay or overshoot on the tight side  we should note that the increas in the feder fund rate through late last year were predict in the market at the outset of the rate increas in mid        rough speak  the economi should alreadi have react to the first     basi point of fed fund rate increas  the lag argument appli to rate increas beyond the   percent fed fund rate   inflat expect have risen rough    basi point sinc our march meet   rais the fund rate target    basi point today bare keep up with inflat expect  mani of us have comment that we are between the scylla of unemploy and the charybdi of inflat   now  i went back and actual look up a bit about that stori  and quit frank  it was becaus i did not know how to spell charybdi    laughter   and then i found that this stori  written over       year ago  was actual an exampl of risk manag   some of you who are better classic scholar than i will rememb that in homer   s odyssey  odysseus is given advic by circ to sail closer to scylla for charybdi could drown his whole ship   odysseus then success navig the ship past scylla and charybdi  but scylla manag to catch six of his men  devour them aliv  well  charybdi is our inflat risk   we would like to navig down the center of these hazard water  but in conduct monetari polici  we are in a pre gps world   visibl is limit  and as i look at the data and talk with busi contact  i think i hear breaker  if you will  in the direct of charybdi  which is our inflat risk   but as everi sailor know  the fog   funni thing to sound   i may be wrong  but i think i hear inflat breaker in the distanc  i have concern both about end rate increas too soon and about overshoot on the high side  these two risk need to be balanc in light of the relat cost of increas rate too much or too littl   in my view  it is better to take the risk of rais the fund target too much than of stop too soon   if we stop too soon and inflat rise further  the cost of bring inflat back down are like to be consider   we may not lose the ship  but charybdi can caus a lot of damag   as we have learn all too pain over the year  charybdi is not just inflat  but rather inflat now plus higher unemploy later   charybdi  therefor  has her own scylla just behind her as demonstr veri nice in altern simul number five  even if inflat   not rise but we conclud that a strong economi requir further restraint  market disrupt and mix signal from the fomc could be a problem   it is not help for the market to view the fomc as a sourc of whipsaw  which would be the case if we paus and then resum rate increas relat quick   when we paus  we should be reason confid that we can expect  although not commit  to paus for sever meet   under current circumst  we would confus the market by paus for onli one meet  i believ  convers  paus later after further rate increas or back rate down a bit after a paus should encourag fair prompt resumpt of expans and minim market disrupt   if we take monetari restraint too far  the scylla of unemploy risk may claim a few vic   but i would rather take that risk than the risk of get ani closer to charybdi  if we rais the fund target    basi point  the messag to market should be that the fomc will now make polici decis one meet at a  e without commit as to decis at futur meet  the messag ought not to be that the fund rate is like to be unchang   no guidanc is not the same as    no chang    guidanc   if we cannot get this messag across in the statement  we certain should be abl to do so in the minut   market should not interpret our polici decis at this meet as a precursor to a paus  if we rais the fund rate target    basi point  we will probabl have to maintain forward guidanc to avoid send mislead signal   we could end forward guidanc by indic in the minut that we do not intend to use similar languag in june but that drop the forward guidanc is not necessarili a precursor to a paus   we will make that judgment meet by meet as we assess the signific of new inform for the outlook  i am well awar that    basi point would be a larg shock to the market  and to be veri honest with myself about what that might mean  i have said to myself that the dow might fall as much as     or     point and the long bond yield might rise    to    basi point   i am will to impos this shock to get ahead of the market   i believ it would be better to act decis now rather than later in respons to accumul bad news  i want to talk just a moment also about the minut of this meet   these minut will appear short after the may    releas of the preliminari first quarter gdp number  which the staff now put at       so the upward revis there is signific   i think that the next unemploy report come out on june    which would be short after the minut also   i made a coupl of point that i think are veri import   one  the minut need to be true to the transcript  which will be releas a littl less than six year from now   it is extrem import for the long run credibl of the institut that there not be ani disconnect between the minut and the transcript   i believ that the minut should report that the committe discuss altern c  two  we have an opportun in the minut to do sever thing that i think are import   first  we can use them to show the committe   s concern with inflat and inflat expect   we have had extens discuss begin with the staff present about those issu   i think that the market is actual go to take that concern as someth of a surpris and a shock becaus it has view our stanc as be not veri concern about inflat   if we reflect in the minut the discuss around the tabl  i think the market will take that as some genuin new inform   second  we ought to use the minut as an opportun to get out from under the forward guidanc and to explain that the guidanc is not intend to provid ani signal about what our action is like to be   i would not take the guidanc out of the statement of this meet for the reason that i think   has explain veri well   but we should be abl to use the minut to say that  when the committe want to make such an announc that a paus is like  we will do so direct with plain languag   we are not go to do it indirect   i think we ought to be abl to make that clear in the minut   third  we should also say in the minut that polici decis will be base on the implic of new inform for the econom outlook that we receiv between meet  so those are thing i think we could get across in the minut with the space to do so   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to share  as i did the last  e  a littl differ perspect on this   i continu to agre with the  book and other    project that the economi should slow as we move through the rest of this year and next year   i think that   s an import factor to consid becaus the polici action we take today are gear toward those period as well  i don   t want to give the impress that i   m not concern about inflat  becaus i am   part of my concern is not that we will end too soon but that we will be too quick to revers our posit   let me explain   what we have now is that current gdp growth and some of the inflationari event are the effect of past substanti accommod polici   now our instinct are to keep increas the rate until we actual see the slow   thus  we tend to overshoot in term of tight   that sound familiar to me   i think i   ve seen this movi  and that   s part of my concern  as i said  i am concern about inflat   in fact  i wish we had gotten where we are today a littl sooner  but we didn   t   our challeng is to hold firm now and to hold firm when the economi begin to slow  and our instinct will be to eas  especi as the specul excess begin to wash out of the economi and we have a lot of peopl say that it   s absolut imper that we eas to offset that specul washout  i think that   s realli our challeng   i   m not concern so much about just today   it   s more the larger context ahead of us   what i   m tri to say is that i judg we are about where we ought to be  we should allow the market to work the rest of the yield curv and the economi  so that we bring the imbal that are in play now back into balanc and  when that happen  we hold our disciplin and not let our instinct to eas and offset that disciplin veri quick take over   that   s realli the futur challeng of monetari polici as we work through the rest of this year and into the next   thank you
thank you   presid
well  i think bill pool has summar a lot of what i would have said   i forecast that in the memo that was sent around   i would advoc tighten    basi point   i would disput onli one comment of presid pool   s   get ahead of the market is less import than get ahead of the economi   i do take note of your fomc surpris chart   the question realli is  if we undertak an action  will it lead to a market reaction that might affect the economi negat   it   s not so much that we have a market surpris   we   re go to have market surpris at ani  e  and i can walk you through  after thirti year of oper a hedg fund  a four year cycl of market surpris   a market surpris is go to hit us at some point  but the question is  is it a trip wire   there is a risk that the trip wire would be the hous market   we   ve discuss that to a great degre  although you  mr  chairman  i think gave us some good data on the offset  i think it   s import for us to get ahead of what i view   not just becaus of the anecdot evid we have but also becaus of the work done by our staff   as a signific expans in capit expenditur with growth shift to veri strong busi invest  excess liquid that is go to fuel that invest  and as we all discuss  signific indic that inflat is stronger than we would like to see it   we see that analyt  as i said earlier  with the way we calcul inflat in dalla  but also from the anecdot evid  have said that  i think the word that is now in altern b is more attract   i know there are some who would like to provid what i call a full frontal view of what we look like and what we discuss   but as i like to say  mr  chairman  in romanc the market some  a littl modesti might be more effect in achiev the ul  goal   i think we   ve achiev that to an extent   i do not like the languag that we see growth as like to moder becaus i don   t have confid in that statement and i   m not sure it   s necessari   i   d prefer the word that presid pool sent around in term of it breviti   howev  in the interest of perhap more exposur  or a more reveal present  i would like to add one word  which is the word    global    befor    resourc util      laughter   thank you veri much
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   in the last coupl of meet i have had concern that i think other are share  or did share  that we not go too far in this round of tighten  given what i thought were perhap transitori price pressur  some extra capac in labor market  and financi market that were final becom less accommod with all that would mean for asset market  in particular hous  certain there continu to be these downsid risk   the hous falloff that we   re begin to see sign of could hit not just residenti construct but also consumpt harder than we expect  and rise energi cost could exact a greater tax on spend   but as i note  we have yet to see much of that project slow in the incom data   it   s still a forecast   other have focus on that as well  the more import thing that has happen  and it has certain chang my mind with regard to the balanc of risk  is the chang in the inflat environ   market contact tell me that they perceiv the fed as be behind the curv on inflat   now  normal i wouldn   t take market chatter veri serious   but given the tilt in incom data  think about it a bit is worthwhil if we are concern  as we should be  about our continu credibl  at this point  as i said earlier  i am more uncertain than i have been about where polici should be and how fast it should get there  and that uncertainti automat take me to altern b   i think    basi point  not     is the right move today even though over the cours of the next sever meet we may well move for    or beyond that   i just think that    basi point would come as a shock to market and  frank  given that i   m realli not certain about where thing are  would overdo thing in term of my own perspect of where we need to be right now   when you are uncertain  move slowli is usual the wiser polici   so that   s my polici perspect      basi point  i was go to fool around with altern b  and i have a whole bunch of languag in here to fool around with altern b  but it get me to exact the same place as this new languag    laughter  so i   m realli happi that we have taken out the refer to inflat be contain   i think it was in row     and modest firm in row     not that thing might not work out that way  it   s just that i   m not as certain that i want to say that direct and give the impress  which would have been reinforc by that languag  that we   re more like than not to stop at the next meet   i agre with other who have said that  if possibl  we should aim for make thing a littl   i hesit to use this word   more uncertain about what we   re go to do at the next meet rather than give the certainti of a paus  i have a question  howev   the second part of the sentenc in row   and the sentenc in row   seem to me to say about the same stuff   do we need them both   i must be miss someth subtl here becaus to me they just seem to overlap a lot and make us doubl data depend
it   s the belt and suspend approach    laughter   howev  when we get to the final discuss  i   ll ask for a straw vote on whether to drop row
thank you   that   s it
thank you  mr  chairman   as i state earlier  i basic agre with the staff   s current baselin project that  with the rate action today  we have a monetari polici that support the return of gdp growth to somewher near it long term potenti  along with both core and headlin inflat begin to turn back down as the year proceed  i state at our last meet that i was will to see the fed fund rate move abov my best es  of where neutral is to a level that might be somewhat restrict as insur against some of the advers inflat effect of energi price shock that have hit the economi for more than two year now   i note with interest that a member of the board staff report on monday at the board brief that the staff think that energi shock will add   percent to core pce inflat this year   es  such as this one give me some comfort in decid to reach beyond my es  of neutral  but there are limit as to how far i   m will to reach  we all know that there is a histor relationship between energi price shock and weak on the real side of the economi   i also know  mr  chairman  that some economist  for whom i have a great deal of respect  have suggest that the weak was part associ with monetari polici action taken in respons to those shock   i think we have reach a point where further polici action to head off potenti price pressur may come at the expens of tip the scale in the direct of increas greater risk to econom activ  i admit that i   m not happi with the degre and speed of the declin in core inflat in the long term project includ in the bluebook   it has been frustrat for me to watch the headlin inflat number keep move up as a result of energi shock and to see our  et for move core inflat lower get push further and further into the futur   but if the board staff   s es  of the effect of energi price shock on core pce is reason  it suggest that there is room for some further improv in core inflat onc the energi shock end  other thing be equal of cours  one fundament element of the outlook that might not be equal is the drag of the inflat expect anchor   i know that  as prudent central banker  we have to be constant alert to the possibl that inflat expect will take off   our worst fear  most certain  is that they will creep up covert and catch us unawar   so i applaud the dilig of the bluebook author in look for these weapon of mass destruct  but i   m not convinc that the evid that we   ve compil should provok us to attack just yet  at the last meet  i indic that i was inclin to paus after this meet   that   s still my inclin   but the last cpi report  coupl with littl direct evid that the pace of econom activ is slow  has move me closer to put even odd on our appropri choic at the june meet   i said in march that i would not like a statement that induc market particip to automat expect a better than    percent chanc for a rate hike in june   it   s clear to me from our discuss today that some are lean toward a rate increas in june and that they   re go to wait and see if the data will talk them out of it   i also know that some peopl are think about a paus  and we   re go to wait and see if the data are go to talk us into it   the most common theme i   m hear is    wait and see     and in my opinion the wisest cours is to make the smallest possibl number of chang in our statement and hope that the data will speak more convinc over the next month and a half  so my prefer is to make as few chang as possibl to the statement that we made last month   i think altern b   that   i like ad the languag   the second half of passag   reinforc the messag of last month   s minut that were wide interpret as    wait and see      so that   s where i am   i support altern b   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d actual rather think about the metaphor of presid     full frontal nuditi   for our subcommitte than i would about the weapon of mass destruct and attack    laughter
i never use the word    nuditi    now    laughter
full frontal   okay    laughter
take it out of the transcript    laughter
let   s move on to monetari polici     he said blush    laughter   i think we do face an interest and challeng situat here   i agre  as i said befor  that the inflat risk are higher than they seem a month or two ago and appear more palpabl  more immedi  than they did  that has to be balanc against a forecast that thing are in train that will end up contain those risk   mayb not drive inflat down to where some peopl want it but at least keep it from rise   but we haven   t realli seen a lot of evid that those thing in train to contain the risk are there yet   i acknowledg   presid hoenig made a veri good point   that there is some risk of overshoot   i think in a situat like this  we have to be forward look but we also need to make realli sure on the inflat front   so i   d rather risk overshoot than undershoot at this point in the game  we do need to strong resist ani tendenc for inflat to rise  and the public need to understand that that   s where our focus is   in my view  that requir   point today and convey a sens that we still see upsid risk and are prepar to act if those upsid risk to inflat materi   like presid    i   d like to see market rate at least at their current level   i   d rather see us end up with rate a littl higher than they are now than otherwis   convey this thought would probabl leav rate intact and also leav market reaction to incom data construct   if we say we   re worri about inflat and inflat come in a littl higher  market will react veri quick   i think the new languag of altern b   this  and i support it   i think the key part is in row        the committe judg that some further polici firm may yet be need to address inflat risk      that   s so close to last  e that i think the market will interpret it correct  at the same  e  we have to be open mind about when ani further increas will be requir  i alway thought a sensibl path for polici here would be to go up quick and then kind of flatten out the trajectori   we kind of got caught in an everi  e escal and never were abl to flatten out that trajectori   but we   re in a posit where we can both be concern about inflat and put the market on notic that the trajectori of ani further rise will be a littl flatter   i think that   s construct  and b   that  so i support that languag

thank you  mr  chairman   overal  i think polici is current well posit to maintain price stabil over  e  and a   point increas today  which i favor  will on the margin enhanc that posit   as i note earlier this morn  i do think the uncertainti about the inflat outlook has increas  and it may be that the risk are now tilt to the upsid   but on the other side of that particular observ is the well known lag in monetari polici between our action and their effect   we have cumul move a lot  and some of those move have been recent  and so i don   t think all of the effect are current evid  in the past  i have emphas with some frequenc the under flexibl and resili of the economi   as a consequ of that  i   m not realli worri that we might go too far or overshoot   i think the economi absorb these thing pretti well  but our oblig is to tri to get it right   i   m not exact sure where right is  and so as a consequ of that i want to make sure that we have some flexibl go forward and that we continu to emphas the data driven natur of our decis   i think altern b accomplish all of that  so i   m in favor of both the action and the languag associ with it
thank you  mr  chairman   i favor the    basi point increas  and  general  the languag of altern b   but i do have some specif suggest on it that i   ll mention at the end of my comment  first  i want to say a few word about a topic that mani of us have been speak about public  which is our price stabil goal and our comfort zone for inflat   this talk is get a lot of attent  and my current think is that the zone is   percent to   percent on core pce   the more we use this languag of a comfort zone or   as i think  mr  chairman  you said in your comment   a zone of price stabil  the more it frame the public   s interpret of our inflat outlook and our polici move   that   s not a bad thing  in general  but i am concern that mani analyst are interpret this comfort zone as a rang of accept outcom so that it  sn   t matter where we are within that zone of indiffer  i don   t view it that way   my prefer is to see inflat move toward the center of the zone  like the bluebook altern simul that we talk about befor   for me  have our inflat forecast consist run at or abov the top end of my comfort zone is a problem   market particip will ratchet up their view of the zone  and our credibl is then go to suffer   i would hope that our polici action would be aim at have inflat head more clear for the interior of that rang   subject  of cours  to the constraint of our dual mandat  with regard to today   s decis  i certain prefer that market clear understand that  if necessari  we   re readi to move to a rate abov   percent   i think the languag in altern b   that  i suggest one major chang to it  which i think peopl would consid major  and that is in number    number   now is  as i understand  exact the same as it was last  e   the phrase in there that realli concern me is    and inflat expect remain contain      bill pool talk about the minut reflect accur the meet  and i don   t think that statement accur reflect the discuss at this meet   a lot of concern has been express here about inflat expect   differ degre of concern  but certain the atmospher is differ from that in the last meet in which we discuss it   one way to deal with that is just to delet those five word and end the sentenc with the word    check      anoth would be to go back to the languag we had befor   i would go either way on that  but i don   t think we should put that languag in the statement
first vice presid stone
thank you  mr  chairman   given that i see the risk to growth as reason balanc and the risk to inflat as slight more to the upsid  i support rais the fund rate    basi point   with resourc util at high level and core inflat near the top of the rang i consid consist with price stabil  ani posit aggreg demand shock could result in inflat higher than we would like   so i think that we should take some action today to lean against this possibl  and i see that    basi point would do that   i don   t sens right now that we   re behind the curv and that we need to do more  i think the fund rate is approach the level that   s consist with stabl inflat and growth at potenti  but i   m not sure whether today   s move will be the last or when the next move will be requir  that will depend on what the incom data tell us about where the economi is head and our assess of the risk to that forecast  there has been a percept by some  and it   s been discuss around the tabl  that the fomc often make one or two move too mani   at the last meet  i said i would rather accept the risk of take one or two move too mani than of come up short   the risk associ with this would be magnifi if it prove difficult for the fomc to revers itself  should it perceiv ex post that rate have been rais too high   we recent did a studi to look at our past behavior  and the staff analysi show that there have been numer episod in which the fomc has paus and then continu along the polici path and even paus and revers cours   so that give me some comfort that we have the flexibl to take the appropri action base on incom data  turn to the languag  i had about three page worth of materi  most of which i can throw away   i think altern b come veri close to the languag that i think appropri   i have some sympathi with presid     s and presid     s comment that leav the phrase about inflat expect the way it was in the last meet   not fair repres the tenor of the discuss today   balanc that a littl is the chang in the languag in row    which now address the inflat issu more head on and thus show the chang in the tenor of the discuss a bit   but we certain would not want the market to perceiv a lower polici path by read that in the languag  and mayb the inflat expect phrase might do that   that conclud my comment
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   let me see if i can be reason concis   first of all  i don   t think we have ani viabl altern except the    basi point of tighten today  so i support that   we   ve probabl had more consensus around the tabl this morn than i rememb in a long  e about the way we want to convey the risk that is clear on the inflat side   the chang that have been made in the altern b languag from the first version that we saw are clear in the right direct   the languag is much crisper and cleaner and emphas the point  i would associ myself most close with presid     s comment   i want to repeat a comment that i made  though  in the pre meet comment  and i think it   s still applic as we think about the way this statement evolv until the kohn group   s work is finish   i hope we   ll tri to avoid expand the languag and be tempt to add more word  more precis  and more care forward look guidanc until we have those fundament strateg discuss that i think are go to come from don   s work group   i   m glad we did not go through with the idea of includ an employ forecast   we still have in row   what i consid to be a second level detail on where the moder is go to come from   i think the list probabl reflect the discuss  but until we deal with the kohn subcommitte   s work  we ought to avoid the temptat to say more and explain more fulli and give more guidanc and more precis to our guidanc   i don   t think that serv us well  as i said befor  i think we   re close to where we need to be   i think that   s what the group said this morn   we do need some flexibl   i   m not as concern as some that that suggest some uncertainti on our part   we can   t take uncertainti away from the market   so i hope that we   ll talk about the issu that michael   rais about whether we   re be too reassur about inflat expect   i   m general comfort with the current construct of altern b   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b   i favor rais the fund rate    basi point  not    basi point  today   the statement help us get off the treadmil we   ve been on and enhanc flexibl  but it  sn   t tie our hand into paus in june if the data between now and then are so strong as to necessit  in our view  a further move at that  e   i think b   leav open the door to as much addit tighten as may be need  wherea c actual suggest that we think the tighten is over  now  person  i judg the addit amount of tighten need to be modest  although i think a bit of addit restraint is probabl desir   i think we are close to be done becaus i   m comfort with the  book forecast  and i also think our polici stanc is rough appropri base on a varieti of rule base metric   i do think a bit more tighten is need becaus i   d prefer to see core inflat gradual head down toward the center of my comfort rang rather than see it stabil in the vicin of   percent  as in the  book forecast   i want to emphas that onli a bit is requir  not a show of overwhelm forc  becaus  as one exampl  the benchmark taylor rule would suggest that a    percent reduct in the target inflat rate  say from   to      the center of my comfort zone  call for an addit increas of onli    basi point in the fund rate  and various simul use op  polici as oppos to rule would similar show a quit slow converg toward the lower target rate   we   ve seen that in past bluebook  i strong favor a paus in our campaign in order to evalu the effect of our polici action to date  unless incom data after this meet contain larg upsid surpris   like presid hoenig  i do certain understand the urg to continu rais rate at everi meet until we   re sure the economi is slow   i still rememb veri well the      tighten episod  and then  as now  there was a sens of great momentum in the economi  pose signific upsid risk to inflat   in circumst like that  the urg to continu tighten is natur   it is instinctu   unfortun  with polici lag such a strategi is a sure recip for overshoot   if we   re lucki enough to stop at exact the right point this  e  as i believ we actual did in        we can be sure that it will feel riski at the moment we stop and wise onli in retrospect   the risk for polici  in my view  are now two side  and this is especi true with the substanti run up sinc our last meet in longer term interest rate  downsid risk due to a possibl polici overshoot are now balanc in my mind with the upsid risk that we have not done enough  and i would consid a paus to evalu where we stand as desir and appropri  unless of cours there is new and surpris inform
thank you   governor olson
thank you  mr  chairman   i suppos i could just support the comment that presid   made and shut up  but i won   t    laughter   i recal in previous meet that i said that increas would be harder and harder to justifi  and i certain expect that by this  e we would have paus  although i do believ that a   point rais is appropri this  e   were we to accept altern a  have condit the market to think that we would rais until we are done  it seem to me that we would send a signal that we were done if we did paus at    percent   on the other hand  the analysi that suggest that there will be a slow of the economi has been a compel argument made in the  book  and therefor the descript in sentenc   seem to me to be accur   were we to rais    basi point  it would have to be on the basi of an analysi that is more a gut feel than an analyt approach   therefor  i think that altern b  the   point  is appropri  we are at an inflect point   as i have heard mani of you say mani  e  the inflect point is the most difficult part of the cycl  when the most difficult decis have to be made   i think presid hoenig made that point earlier   the word that i think is go to attract the most attent is in part   when we say    the extent and  e      by that word we are convey that we are at an inflect point and that we may move away from the everi meet    basi point move  or at least that is how i interpret it   so i am in favor of altern b as written
thank you  mr  chairman   i support a    basi point increas at this meet  and i like the chang that have been made to altern b becaus i want to make sure that we came out of this with a statement that left our option open at the next meet  while the recent inflat trend   recent be the last six month or  in other word  from befor the hurrican to where we are now   have give me a littl more anxieti  i can visual scenario that will make us want to paus or stop at the next meet   that is whi i  too  like the word    extent and  e    in line   that governor olson just cite   that word allow us to stop or keep go and to choos the  e   i think the word there is excel     inflat expect remain contain      i have no suggest about how to chang that line  but after listen to the dialogu around the tabl  i have to admit that it is the one line that give me paus  the various measur of core inflat have been run in the upper   percent area in the past six month  and that is abov my person comfort zone   if other folk are look at those measur  then that is perhap part whi we   re get some of these movement in long term rate   the word   leav me uncomfort   at least    well    is gone  inflat expect are now just    contain       laughter   but they are contain at a level abov what i would be comfort with   how we chang the word i do not know  but i agre that that particular phrase in the statement   creat some anxieti
i agre with the    basi point move at this  e   i think we have seen some begin of evid of heighten inflat risk relat to six week ago  and i think it is also veri import  as presid   mention  that look back histor  we do not want to get too far out ahead and then have some regret   but we also have to be concern about how our action will be interpret by the market and to think about the longer run expect   we have to convey that we do have some uncertainti about where the economi is go  and i think that is well reflect in our discuss here and in altern b  but it is extrem import to keep our powder dri   i realli like the idea of say that not onli will we be look at the data as we normal do in our due dilig but also we are go to be look at thing becaus there is uncertainti   we do not have an ideolog view that we must make sure that everi last concern about inflat is stamp out  without concern about growth  or vice versa  also  as i said last  e  it is hard to know exact where we need to go to be at the right level   at best  we can be within    basi point of where we would hope thing would be  but obvious  it is quit liter a move target sinc the under economi is move   that said  i think it is veri import to emphas in the statement what first vice presid stone mention  if you look at what we say in line    we do specif mention that some further polici firm may yet be need to address inflat risk  which is not someth that we had specif singl out befor and which i think help offset the concern about the phrase    inflat expect remain contain     although we have discuss that inflat expect have move up somewhat  i think that to say they are no longer contain is incorrect   we have seen a bit of tick up of actual inflat and a bit of tick up of some  but not all  measur of inflat expect   as vinc mention  the most recent number come from blue chip suggest that the profession forecast are not say that inflat expect are move up   i am concern that  if we took out that phrase  which we have had for a while  we would be suggest that we do think thing are becom unhing and that might be a self fulfil propheci move in exact the wrong direct   so i think the balanc that we have now heighten our emphasi on inflat risk in number   but   not say that inflat expect have move too far beyond  and i do not think they have move too far beyond  where they were befor or that they have becom unhing   i like the balanc that is there between the two  i also like keep in the red phrase in the second part of line    but a small amend to make it perhap a bit easier to swallow and to make it seem not repetit with the statement in number   is that  rather than say    in ani event     we simpli say     the committe thus will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to support the attain of it object      thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b and would like to echo governor   with respect to the refer to inflat expect remain contain   in light of where the market   s expect are  for better or for wors go into today and june  the omiss of that languag would be a veri loud omiss   i think that altern like would not be expect or generat the kind of balanc reaction that we are tri to achiev   the other emphasi that we have in section   address what i think is the balanc of the discuss that we had today   i also like in altern b the refer to the current state of the economi in the first line of part    where we say that it has been quit strong so far this year   this word provid some credibl to some of the data that the market are perhap not as focus on as they should be  so on balanc  i do support altern b as written and would make onli a coupl of point   as we approach our last move  or potenti our last move  with respect to this tighten cycl  it   strike me that the burden of persuas  if not the burden of proof  rest with us to chang cours   i do not think that there is ani evid to this point that we ought to stop or even suggest to the market that a paus is in some way immin   we have all larg agre that the risk of polici error here have increas  and that is whi a lot of consist between the altern b languag and our march fomc languag is perfect appropri  as the vice chairman referenc in the earlier round  we are tri to express to the market our view of uncertainti so that they do not take what we say as a guarante of futur result but look at the data in real  e as we look at the data rather than look direct just at us   the balanc that has been struck in section     that veri well   should we get to a paus at some point over the cours of the next sever meet  it need to be preced by vigil  which i do see reflect in section     i would conclud onli that it is better to leav interest rate expect higher at this moment until we see some real sign of inflat fall more into that zone of comfort  which presid   and other referenc   thank you
thank you   my sens is that we probabl have a bit more to do  and it would be help to signal that   of cours  we cannot be sure we have more to do  and we certain cannot be sure how much more  if anyth  we have to do  we have sort of debat two view on the op  path go forward at various  e   one option is that we move until we are confid that after the move we can leav polici expect flat   anoth option is to say we move until just short of that and paus at a point that leav some posit slope to the path go forward   i guess i am a littl more comfort with the latter strategi than with the former  even if we knew with confid what was clear op   we realli would not know at this point when that paus should come   we alway face some uncertainti about the band that defin the appropri polici path  but i think we still want to err on be at the upper edg of that band  wherev it is   we probabl want to stop tighten befor inflat peak  given the lag with which polici oper  but we probabl do not want to signal that we are go to stop when expect at long horizon are still move up a bit  a few final point   i think inflat expect requir a difficult balanc   we don   t want to look as though we are spook by the rise in inflat expect  nor do we want to look as though we are indiffer to them   i can see lot of way we can strike that balanc  a rhetor prefer   we all like to use the simplifi rhetor devic of say that we are go to be more    data depend    go forward   i prefer that we say that we are go to be more    outlook depend    or    forecast depend    so that we do not look as though we are go to be a littl too volatil in respond to near term chang in the data   i am broad comfort with the languag in b  and i think we should obvious move    basi point today
thank you   let me just talk a bit about the polici option and the statement   i think we are face two goal that are difficult to achiev at the same  e   the first one is to respond to some increas in inflat risk and what might be a bit of an inflat scare in the bond market  in order to respond to that  we would have to signal that we are will and abl to continu to respond to inflat as it rear it ugli head   if you like  inflat is the nail  and monetari polici is the hammer   we do not have to strike the nail  but we have to show that we are not put down the hammer   we have to keep it in our hand    laughter   in that respect  i think it is import that we not signal that there is a definit paus   i am also disturb by the respons of inflat compens to those signal   we need to keep the option open to respond onc or even more than onc if the inflat data and the econom outlook dictat that respons   i do think that the use of the further polici firm languag in part    which repeat the march statement  will be view as hawkish and will probabl have some upward effect on yield  our second object is to maxim our flexibl  given the degre of uncertainti that we now face in the economi   i agre with vice chairman   that an op  polici can well includ paus for two reason   perhap more than two  but here are two   the first is that we gather inform over  e  to the extent that we gather use inform and uncertainti is resolv  we can make a better decis   between now and june we are go to see two cpi report  two round of hous sale and start and permit  two retail sale figur  and two industri product figur  just to note some of the data that we will be see between now and the next meet   so i think it is use for us to indic that we will be respond to chang in the outlook and to leav ourselv the flexibl to respond in june accord to how the outlook evolv  i am veri sensit to the issu of overshoot   at least in principl  the correct respons is that we look at the outlook  not at the current data   to the extent that our forecast incorpor the lag effect of interest rate  we should  in principl at least  be tri to accommod that issu   so i recommend a    basi point increas today   i recommend altern b  i have a coupl of question for the group   i gather that most peopl have acced to that statement  but let me just ask a coupl of question about the languag   the first is  could we drop number five   it   reemphas the broad principl that we respond to chang in econom prospect  but it is a bit redund given the previous statement   so that is the first question i am go to ask you   the second question has to do with inflat expect   i think it would be a big mistak to somehow indic that we thought they were not contain   first of all  it is not factual correct  as     s demonstr show   second  it would convey a concern about the state of expect that is greater than the one we actual have   what we could do   and i am a littl reluct  but i am open to the suggest   would be to say in that sentenc     inflat expect have risen slight but remain contain    or someth like that
instead of say    remain     you could just say    are
or    are contain
and inflat expect are contain
well  i would say    remain    becaus  rememb  it is even after the chang   they were contain befor  and now they remain contain  despit the increas
yes  but    remain    seem to me to say that they are at the same level as they were befor  wherea    are    say they are in the contain
no  it just say they are still contain   presid
mr  chairman  i like the chang you suggest   the import point is for the outsid world to be awar that we recogn there has been a chang in inflat expect   i mean  if we keep it exact as we had it befor  we look as though we are not awar of what is happen in the marketplac   so i think your chang is a veri good one
is there anyon who has an opposit view
i think as you said  mr  chairman  put in number   that we are singl out one of the two object   address inflat   is go to be perceiv as a hawkish move relat to what we had befor   therefor  i do not think make the addit chang is necessari becaus i think that has larg been convey   given the relat small chang in inflat expect  to even acknowledg that there are small chang   although say so is factual correct   goe further than is necessari   but i share your concern about want to make sure that we are veri clear that we are concern about inflat and inflat expect
i would not chang the languag   i would leav it as it is becaus inflat expect are contain  and we want to make sure they stay contain   that is what the two sentenc independ of one anoth do   i think it is a good balanc
i agre with presid hoenig and governor
first vice presid stone
even though i said i certain would think about it  i am satisfi from what i have heard around the tabl about the balanc between part   and part     the probabl is of do more harm than good with chang that  and so even modest chang in the word are probabl not worth make
mr  chairman  in the subsequ sentenc we have    the potenti to add to inflat pressur     and then in the first sentenc in paragraph   we say that    further polici firm may be need to address inflat risk      so you want to be care you do not have overkil here  even though i am veri worri about inflat
thank you for these comment   if it is all right with you  presid    i would like to hold off on this until the evid is a littl clearer that inflat expect have move up   other comment   governor bie
mr  chairman  in number    i alway felt it was redund when we had clear communic we were on this long trajectori   but when we are near a turn point or a paus point  it is probabl more import to remind the market that thing can happen that we do not expect  that it is not a precis forecast  and i find that this sentenc is more use at turn than it is when we are on a long run trajectori   so i just do not feel good about take it out now when we have had it when it was realli redund
i can see that take out    remain contain    would signal a chang in our contain size that would probabl confus the market  but i am broad sympathet to michael   s point  and as inflat expect evolv further  i am go to be more sympathet to that   with regard to five  take it out strike me as like to caus market to view what is read in altern b  part    as the reword of what is part   in the march statement  and so i do not think they are go to view it as a withdraw of substant indic of the extent to which we are go to be outlook depend   so i would be in favor of take it out
i am in favor of take it out unless someon can tell me what differ thing it say other than what is said in the last part of sentenc     mayb i am miss someth  but i think sentenc or row    whatev we call it  say that we are go to firm  to address inflat risk  but we emphas that the extent and  e will depend import on the evolut of the econom outlook as impli by incom inform   how is that differ from what we are say in row
the slight differ is that it refer specif to firm wherea the last paragraph say that as a broad general principl
do we think that the last sentenc give us the abil then to reduc rate in the context
becaus there are way you could chang the languag in row   to deal with that  but if that is what you think  if you feel that that give us a littl more flexibl  i guess i do not have a problem with it
i support leav row   in  and i support it becaus the old row   refer to the dual object of price stabil and sustain growth  which came in row     the new row     not refer to sustain growth at all   this is vagu  but if challeng  we could at least say that we have not forgotten about our dual object   if we omit ani even indirect refer to the dual object  it   not describ our reaction function and would not be the right thing to do
i would append to governor kohn   s remark and just say that for that reason  presid    it   have the benefit of ad to flexibl
i strong support what governor kohn said
all right   presid
this is slight heresi  but after the word    inform    in row    i would just put    in support of the attain of our object    or    it object      take out the black stuff   it is a slight chang   that achiev what cathi want
there are easi way to modifi row   to make it do the same thing
that is what i mean
at this point  have heard the discuss  i would like to propos to the group that we keep line   where it is   line   talk specif about this firm propos and the possibl of a paus   line   respond to both of our object and re emphas the fact that we do have  of cours  symmetr employ inflat object   i think i have heard around the tabl a few  e in previous context that ani chang has implic that we may or may not be abl to predict veri well  ani other comment on this statement   yes  presid pool
i would like to ask vinc if he would give us a judgment about how the languag of altern b is like to affect the market   s probabl of action in june
oh  i thought that question was direct to dino    laughter
i would be happi to have you both address it
in ye day   s quot  the juli fed fund contract was at       so that is basic a   out of    chanc that the committe would act   in the design of b  we thought that the probabl would move it up into the       to       rang   i think it is probabl a littl tougher than what is in the bluebook  so i am a littl more confid it would be abov
it would rais it
i will tell you my instinct is that the part that is in red will be view as actual produc a presumpt that the first part will not be carri through   as it say     polici firm may yet be need      but then the part in red  it seem to me  temper that veri  veri substanti  and it is not clear to me at all that this languag is like to increas the market   s odd on a further increas in june   that is my own feel
the test i would appli would be what the odd are as of octob  there is the possibl that there might be some shift in  e between  say  june and august  for exampl
obvious this is someth that is veri hard to gather ani evid on in advanc   i am just tell you my gut feel for what   s go to happen is that this will reduc the market   s expect about action in june  and i would be surpris if that were just simpli switch out later in the year
well  presid pool  the most unsatisfi paragraph in the bluebook meet after meet are the one that tri to divin what the market reaction to altern statement will be   we do not have a scientif way of do it
the reason i rais the question is that i agre veri much with   that we do not want languag that reduc the market expect of anoth action in june  unless the data between now and then chang the outlook suffici
there are two part  though   part is the effect today   my guess is that it will be hawkish on net  but there is a lot of uncertainti  and so you may be right   the other part of this is the indic of respons to data   so if the intermeet data   and i note how mani differ thing we are go to be see   are suggest of greater inflat pressur  i imagin that when we sit down here in june we will have a much better idea of what is expect and what we are like to do at that point   dino
again  the three word that the market would be look for are    further polici firm      those are the three that they will be look for and that will be taken as the signal of like action in june   now  what follow actual creat a bit more uncertainti becaus it is not as direct as some previous statement have been   so i think the probabl goe up  but mayb not to     percent or to    or    percent   so i think vinc is in the right ballpark in his judgment
one last point is that the second part of the sentenc in row   is part alreadi in market becaus it is a repetit of what was in the joint econom committe tes oni   so in that sens  i agre with dino that they will be look at the earlier word
are there ani other comment   yes
i just had a question   it is a slight  minor chang  but would it make ani differ if you took out the two word    emphas that    from number
i think it would make a differ becaus it would focus the market veri much on the first part of the sentenc  which basic is say that we are go to move again in june   what we want to do is retain the flexibl to move or not move  depend on the flow of data between now and then
so it is intent that those two word are in there
yes   ani other comment
i will be read the direct from page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around   percent     and the risk assess from the press releas that   s be hand around     the committe judg that some further polici firm may yet be need to address inflat risk but emphas that the extent and  e of ani such firm will depend import on the evolut of the econom outlook as impli by incom inform   in ani event  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to support the attain of it object     chairman bernank vice chairman    governor bie presid guynn   governor kohn  governor    presid   governor olson   presid pianalto  governor   presid    yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
the governor need to join me   recess
thank you  everyon   there are a coupl of other quick item   first  i would like to ask governor kohn to give a brief report on his subcommitte on communic
thank you  mr  chairman   presid  n and   have agre to serv with me on this subcommitte  the full frontal subcommitte  i guess    laughter   we see our mission as help the committe   bring issu to the committe  help frame the discuss  tri to figur out the topic and the logic order in which they should be address  and reach out to committe member   we do not see our mission as come up with hard and fast recommend to the fomc but as just help the discuss along   if we do see some consensus develop as we talk to you  we will certain let you know  the chairman has made it veri clear to me that everyth is on the tabl in term of communic between the committe member and the outsid world   we will think about goal and how best to meet them  how we can accomplish this   our object for the come intermeet period is to put an agenda togeth  to figur out the topic that we collect should be talk about and some order in which to approach this   so we will be talk to you between now and the june meet to get your view on what should be on the tabl and how we should approach some of these issu
thank you   we have now had experi with both a two day and a one day meet   i hope that mayb in june we will be abl to make some kind of decis about how to schedul meet go forward   i am go to ask   to poll everyon dure the intermeet period about prefer as to meet structur  schedul  and the like   if anyon would like to make a comment at this point about today   s meet or this general issu  this would be the  e   i hear none   you will be hear from    and we will put this on the agenda for discuss next meet  the final formal action is just to note that the next meet will be a two day meet on june    and      thank you   we are adjourn  end of meet
