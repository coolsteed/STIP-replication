good afternoon  everyon   today begin cathi     s last fomc meet   cathi has been a regular particip sinc august       we will have an opportun later in the fall to say goodby to cathi more offici  but i think this will be a good opportun to thank you for your collegi and for thirteen year of tremend contribut to the fomc   thank you veri much    applaus
it has been truli an honor and an incred experi  someth i never expect to happen and a joy through the up and down and in and out of everi meet   so i thank everybodi around the tabl who has been here and made it that way
thank you  and now it is  e for the report on desk oper
it is hard to follow that   thank you  mr  chairman   today  i want to focus on the signific rise in long date treasuri yield that has occur sinc the last fomc meet   as you can see in exhibit    treasuri yield have move sharpli higher over the past six week  although they have recov a bit in the past few day   at two year and longer matur  the shift in the yield curv has been near parallel  with yield rough    basi point higher over this period   as can be seen in exhibit    the rise in nomin ten year treasuri yield has been accompani by a rise in ten year tip yield   becaus the rise in nomin yield has been slight larger than the rise in real yield  forward breakeven inflat rate have risen a bit sinc the last fomc meet   for exampl  exhibit   show the trajectori of the breakeven inflat rate five to ten year in the futur es  use nomin treasuri and tip yield   this measur has risen more than    basi point from it trough in may   so how   one explain the rise in nomin and real treasuri yield and the increas in breakeven inflat   in my opinion  there is one veri compel explan   market particip general believ that the downsid risk to growth have diminish  and this has led to     a sharp shift in monetari polici expect and     a modest chang in investor    assess of inflat risk   but other factor    materi use by mr    is append to this transcript  appendix     also play a role  includ mortgag convex hedg and  perhap  the gradual shift in the appetit of foreign central bank away from u s  treasuri secur toward other asset   as shown in exhibit    monetari polici expect as embodi in the eurodollar futur market have shift sharpli sinc the last fomc meet   in may  a drop of more than    basi point in eurodollar rate was anticip to occur by the end of        in contrast  current the eurodollar futur strip is virtual flat   indic that market expect are close to neutral through        this shift in expect is also evid in respons to our survey of primari dealer   use exhibit   and    we can compar the dealer    forecast befor the may   meet with their forecast befor our meet today   the   circl repres the averag forecast of the dealer  the size of the blue circl indic the frequenc of differ forecast  and the horizont dark line repres market rate   as can be seen in these exhibit  over the intermeet period the dealer forecast have move upward  but much less than market expect   this presum reflect the fact that the market rate repres the mean of potenti outcom wherea the dealer forecast are modal forecast   also  the smaller shift evid in the dealer forecast may reflect the fact that dealer forecast tend to lag chang in market expect when expect are chang rapid   as can be seen in these two exhibit  much of the dispers evid in the forecast toward lower rate has vanish sinc the may   fomc meet  and the skew to the downsid has disappear   dealer who had forecast a flat or higher feder fund rate path general did not alter their forecast   in contrast  dealer who had earlier anticip eas have elimin or dramat scale back those expect   for exampl  the blue circl evid in exhibit   at rate of     percent and     percent are not present in exhibit     the dealer forecast support the notion that expect are chang main becaus market particip are less worri about downsid risk to growth rather than becaus they think that the growth rate of real gdp will like be stronger   with the except of the current quarter  in which gdp forecast have been revis upward sharpli follow a veri weak first quarter  the real gdp forecast of dealer have general not chang materi through        this is illustr in exhibit    instead  as shown in exhibit    dealer are now  collect  more certain about the growth outlook   in other word  the downsid risk to growth have diminish   the reduct in the downsid risk to growth may also be import in explain the modest rise in breakeven inflat measur   if the downsid risk to growth have diminish  then a corollari may be that the upsid risk to inflat have increas  in that case  investor should show more interest in purchas inflat protect  the breakeven inflat measur calcul from nomin treasuri and tip yield has sever compon  includ expect inflat and the premium paid by investor for inflat protect   in assess the rise in these breakeven inflat measur due to diminish downsid risk to growth  it is unclear how to apport the rise in the overal breakeven inflat measur between a higher premium for inflat protect and higher expect inflat   in theori at least  reduc downsid risk to growth might reason be expect to push both compon a bit higher   three other factor behind the backup in treasuri yield bear mention   first  the shift in monetari polici expect and the rise in longer date yield have been a global phenomenon   when yield are rise elsewher  that shift should put some upward pressur on u s  long term rate   second  mortgag relat convex hedg may have exacerb the speed and magnitud of the rise in yield   a rise in yield caus expect rate of prepay on lower coupon fix rate mortgag to fall  which lengthen the averag durat of mortgag portfolio   mortgag servic  the hous relat gses  and other mortgag holder respond by sell long date treasuri secur and long date interest rate swap to reduc the averag durat of their hold   exhibit   show that most convent fix rate mortgag are below current mortgag rate   as rate rise  these mortgag get further    out of the money      this lower expect prepay rate and lengthen durat  and peopl react by hedg   as long term rate keep rise  the effect of higher interest rate on durat gradual lessen as the rate on most outstand mortgag fall further below current market rate   the effect of mortgag convex hedg is evid in the relat underperform of ten year treasuri  which is one of the prefer hedg vehicl versus mortgag  relat to other treasuri matur   the week end on june    had the biggest rise in longer term treasuri yield   as shown in exhibit     this was also the week in which ten year treasuri yield rose the most compar with five year and thirti year treasuri rate   to the extent that mortgag convex hedg push up nomin ten year treasuri yield more than other yield  then it may also temporarili distort breakeven inflat measur   third  diminish appetit among central bank for treasuri secur may have also been a factor behind the rise in longer date yield   central bank buy was often a featur part of the stori when bond term premium were unusu narrow   foreign central bank may have play a role in the recent rise in bond term premium   as shown in exhibit     the growth rate of treasuri custodi hold at the feder reserv bank of new york has slow sharpli sinc april  but it is import not to push this point too strong   although foreign central bank with the largest foreign exchang reserv hold are diversifi their portfolio away from treasuri  they still appear to be extend the averag matur of those treasuri that they hold  which impli a continu bid for longer date treasuri from this sourc   turn now to other market develop  the most strike aspect of this period of rise treasuri yield has been the limit effect that this rise has had on the risk appetit of investor in most other market   this is in sharp contrast to the reduct in risk appetit that occur in a broad array of asset class in late februari and the first half of march   for exampl  as shown in exhibit     the rise in long term yield has not caus the u s  equiti market to retrench   as shown in exhibit     until the past week or so  corpor debt spread have been relat stabl   also  in the foreign exchang market  the carri trade remain aliv and well   one way to see this is in exhibit     which illustr the chang in the valu of the yen against high yield currenc such as the australian dollar and new zealand dollar as well as against the u s  dollar and the euro   as can be seen  in the late februari selloff  the yen ralli  and the high yield currenc sold off sharpli   in contrast  dure the recent rise in interest rate  the yen weaken and the high yield currenc appreci   similar  as illustr in exhibit     although volatil in the u s  treasuri market move up sharpli  shown by the rise in the move index   volatil in the equiti and foreign exchang market remain quit low   in the foreign exchang market  movement between the major currenc continu to be driven main by chang in expect interest rate differenti  exhibit    show the movement in the spread between the septemb      eurodollar futur yield versus euribor futur for europ and euroyen futur for japan   as can be seen here  interest rate expect shift more sharpli upward in the unit state relat to japan than relat to europ   not surpris  as shown in exhibit     the dollar appreci more sharpli against the yen than against the euro over this period   the yen   s weak  which has been persist but stealthi  may begin to receiv more attent   after all  as shown in exhibit     while the nomin yen dollar exchang rate has fluctuat in a relat narrow rang in recent year  the real effect yen exchang rate has declin sharpli over this period   a rate of declin that may be intensifi   for exampl  in may the real effect exchang rate of the yen   as es  by the bis   had fallen to it lowest point sinc the earli     s and had declin near to half of it earli      peak   although the june bis data are not yet avail  the rate of depreci has like increas over the past month   although calm general pervad u s  financi market  there is one import except worthi of note   the subprim mortgag space is still veri unsettl   hurt both by poor hous market fundament and by the problem of two hedg fund sponsor by bear stearn   exhibit    show the behavior of the spread on the abx      index  which is an index base on a basket of credit default swap on under cash secur   as can be seen  the spread has increas to a new high  and under cds spread have also increas   there is a danger that forc liquid of illiquid subprim base secur could exacerb the pressur on this market   howev  it should be note that the bear stearn sponsor hedg fund that are in troubl are not particular larg  the problem of these hedg fund appear to be most except rather than the norm  and the counterparti exposur generat by these hedg fund are broad distribut and have alreadi shrunk sharpli in size   that said  there still are risk that forc sell could drive market price down sharpli  lead to lower mark for other portfolio of asset relat to subprim mortgag   this  in turn  could lead to margin call  investor redempt  and further sell pressur in this market   in term of lesson learn  three point come to mind   first  high credit rate don   t fulli captur measur of risk   the rate are base on the risk of default  not the market risk associ with illiquid   as a result  high leverag portfolio of high rate but illiquid asset are subject to signific market risk that the rate may obscur   second  the perform of some of these complex secur is veri sensit to the correl of return   as correl move higher  the subordin protect offer to senior tranch in complex secur such as cdos  and cdo squar product   cdos of cdos   can evapor quick   becaus the rate for the tranch within such product are typic establish on the basi of histor correl  the default risk for some of these tranch may be underst   third  mark to model asset valuat may artifici smooth return and obscur risk   both to portfolio manag and to investor   the health of the broader cdo and clo  collater loan oblig  market may rest on this same fragil set of assumpt   that credit rate fair captur risk and that histor correl relationship will continu to appli   this impli the potenti for problem   if investor question these assumpt in the subprim area  they could also rethink their assumpt about these risk in the broader market   such a develop might lead to consider less buoyant condit in the corpor debt and loan market   it could be noteworthi that some of the index that refer credit default swap in the corpor debt and loan market have shown some deterior in the past week   final  there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the may fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
on the breakeven inflat rate  the five by five rose more  i believ  than either the five or the ten arithmet becaus the ten rose more than the five and it   s in the spread   it seem odd that a chang in the near term growth outlook would have signific implic for five to ten year inflat expect   are there technic issu there as well as in mortgag hedg  or is it just the way you calcul these spread with the differ in liquid and so on
well  i think there is an issu   you have to wait for the market to settl down   to the extent that you are take a snapshot at a  e that more convex hedg is influenc the ten year and the five year has not caught up  that can be a phenomenon   also  peopl in the marketplac say that peopl in the nomin treasuri market are differ from the peopl who invest in tip  and so the behavior of the two can diverg for short period   i would be more confid if a month from now we saw the same uptick in five to ten year of forward inflat as we do today   i am not convinc it will necessarili persist   it may be that real yield and nomin yield will eventu equilibr as these two market come back into balanc   so my own view would be that it bear watch  but i wouldn   t reach strong conclus about it at this stage
thank you   are there other question for bill  presid
my memori of the long term capit manag situat was that the dollar amount that went into the origin program that the invest bank put togeth when they start to manag the situat wasn   t that much bigger than the money that bear stearn is throw at it hedg fund  yet the effect on the market seem to be veri  veri differ   have been around dure the long term capit episod  i know that there were real concern that the domino effect was go to be enorm becaus of the market uncertainti and the lack of liquid and so forth across a wide rang of instrument   is it the rang or the natur of the instrument   how would you see the two situat and compar them becaus clear this one  for all you can read and understand and even in your own present   sn   t seem to be that much of a system issu
well  i think there   s a differ in term of peopl   s assess of how much risk bear stearn is actual take on in term of their hedg fund   my understand is that they are extend credit  and they are basic take out the credit that was extend by the counterparti for the less high leverag of the two fund   they still have equiti   they are hope that they still have equiti   that the asset of the hedg fund are essenti go to exceed the valu of the loan that they are make   so they   re feel that  if all goe well  they are not go to be out ani money   my memori of long term capit manag  and somebodi can correct me if i   m wrong  is that the peopl who came into that pool were put up equiti   so it is quit differ in term of what was actual be contribut in these two case   bear stearn is just replac the counterparti borrow with it own line of credit
but then they manag it so that they did come out ahead over a period of  e   at least that   s my memori
i   m sorri   is this two hand
i was go to follow up on cathi   s point  but i think don is  too
i was go to do the same
i was just go to remark that the situat was quit differ  ltcm follow the russian debt default   the market were alreadi in consider disarray   all those correl had alreadi begun to turn  and then on top of that you had the fire sale effect of ltcm   you can see some of that in the subprim market  where this thing is concentr   it is just not spread out now  and the whole market situat was veri differ at that  e
i think there is a presumpt in the long term capit manag case that a lot of peopl had similar posit in place   in the bear stearn case  we certain don   t have all the inform at this point  but the general thought at this  e is that there are not a lot of other peopl with the same posit in place
vice chairman  did you have a comment
i agre with all of that  but the relat size is much smaller   much narrow in the type of posit to which they   re expos   the state of the world is dramat differ   direct exposur of the counterparti to bear stearn is veri  veri small compar with other thing   bill is exact right   these guy are make a loan against a set of posit   a right to those posit   not equiti  and what they realiz in the valu of those posit over  e will be determin   they think there is posit valu in that   so the situat is dramat differ   it   not mean that you should view it as particular reassur   you know  these peopl were except experienc in the mortgag credit busi  and there were smart peopl in ltcm  too   laughter
that was the general opinion
but these guy were regard as veri smart peopl  who knew the busi well  and this is just a good exampl of how littl one can know in some sens and what leverag   to your exposur to liquid risk   in this case  peopl were just not will to give them the  e to realiz whatev valu might be in these posit  and this is just a natur consequ of leverag   peopl think they had substanti less leverag than ltcm had in some sens  but that is hard to measur
mr  chairman  i would argu that there are similar in that  with long term capit  most of the stress test had been just comput model driven   then when actual market price began to be quot  you saw the deterior   that is clear the case here   the abx is a technic index   for a lot of the cdo squar market  nobodi know what the valu  as oppos to the price  realli are   there is a differ between price and valu   price is what you pay  valu is what you get   i suppos one charit interpret of this  bill  would be that the good thing about this situat is that we actual may be creat a real market to determin valu on these thing or at least price relat to valu   but i think the phenomena are similar  and i would argu   have been in the busi  although the busi wasn   t as sophist when i use to be in it   that this has broader dimens than those we had befor   if you look at the growth rate of these instrument   again  without ani under sens of what you ul  can cash in if you   re press   it has been a straight upcurv   the number are quit huge  again  i was onc a hedg fund manag   i know all the t  that are play there  includ  by the way  the valuat of under secur   in a day when the busi was less sophist than it is now   i don   t feel i understand this issu   i don   t know about my other colleagu around the tabl  but you did kind send someon down to brief our staff on this   they came out with more question than they did answer  but it was veri help   i am worri that we will be ask public at differ interv and perhap start now what our opinion and perspect are   i   m also worri about give the wrong answer   i wonder if there is not a way   not dure this meet but at some point   that all the princip at this tabl can be brief so that we can understand and have a common approach to this issu   i don   t think the issu is contain   i do think there is enorm risk   i hope that someth good come out of this  but speak person  i would like to understand this better  and i hope that we all understand it veri well in case a negat scenario obtain   that   s just a request
we can monitor the situat here and in new york   i don   t know     if we have ani report or materi that we can share with presid
well  bill and i can get togeth
mayb we could just have a common brief   i think it would be veri help  mr  chairman
i don   t think     you need to be in a posit to offer an opinion on what happen in bear stearn in particular   i don   t think you need to or want to be in the busi of do that in that particular case   regard a broader understand about the implic of what we see in these market  bear stearn is relev also in some broader sens   there is obvious valu in tri to make sure that peopl have as much understand as they can   my suspicion is that you are go to find yourself where most peopl are on this  which is with some differ mix of uneas and reassur that you   re not go to resolv fundament until we get through the next period of excit
well  again     i would suggest that we not comment on this  none of us should comment on it   but     it would be good to have an understand  and     if it get wors  more intens  or troublesom  the committe will have to respond in some way  and it would be nice to at least have a common understand as we go down this path   that   s my suggest or request
there are a coupl of theme   one is that the subprim problem are still be work through the financi market   the second is that subprim is an exampl of a broader class of structur product that are difficult to valu  and that creat some uncertainti in the market in period of stress   presid
i am alway in favor of more understand  but for this committe  what i know about this now suggest that there isn   t ani reason for us to be involv   i compliment vice chairman   on not serv sandwich in this case   laughter   i agre with vice chairman     there   s a certain danger of our comment on stuff like this and lead peopl to believ that we feel some respons for damp or otherwis minim the effect of chang in market price on the chang in other market price
thank you   we are happi to share all the inform we have about the specif case and it broad implic with everybodi   in confid  of cours
other question for bill   if not  i need a motion to ratifi domest oper
so move  particip   second
without object   we will turn now to the econom situat  and we call on
thank you  mr  chairman   my colleagu and i will be refer to the packet entitl    staff present on the econom outlook     your first exhibit summar our econom forecast   as shown in the top panel  we have edg up our forecast for the growth of real gdp this year and next   taken by itself  the increas in interest rate that bill   mention was a negat for our growth outlook  but it was outweigh by a varieti of other factor  includ the higher stock market  the upward revis to wage and salari  and the more favor composit of real growth dure the first half of this year   as shown in the middl pair of    materi use by mr     ms  liang  and mr  leahi is append to this transcript  appendix     panel  we have trim our forecast of the unemploy rate   part in respons to the latest read on this seri and part in light of the slight stronger outlook for real output   and we now have it end      just below   percent  our es  of the natur rate   as shown in the bottom right panel  core pce inflat in the current quarter appear to be run at an annual rate of     percent  consider less than the     percent we expect as of the may  book   howev  as i will discuss later in more detail  we have interpret most of that good news as like to prove transitori and so have taken down our forecast for core inflat over the project period onli     percentag point   exhibit   turn to the market for singl famili hous   the yellow stripe in the top left panel mark major downturn in singl famili hous start sinc        as can be seen in the box to the right  the current contract now rank among these major episod in term of magnitud   it differ import from previous one  howev  in term of it origin becaus this one did not result from a round of monetari tighten aim at take econom activ down to bring inflat under control   that differ has import implic for the like contour of the recoveri  in earlier episod  onc the desir reduct in inflat appear to be in train  the polici rate was brought back down and longer term interest rate often came down as well   but this  e  as shown in the middl left panel  with polici assum to hold at it current posit  we are not bank on ani reduct in mortgag interest rate from here forward  suggest that the hous recoveri may be more subdu than it often has been in the past  one factor that pose some downsid risk is the overhang of unsold home  shown in the middl right panel   month    suppli remain at a veri high level  as we illustr in one of the altern simul in the  book  the contract in the hous sector could be a good deal deeper than the one in our baselin if builder decid to bring inventori down more quick  anoth factor that will be import in shape the recoveri is the pace of sale  shown in the bottom left panel   in light of the tighter condit in the subprim loan market and the recent backup in rate  we have sale move a littl lower over the next few month but then stabil and begin to edg up around the turn of the year   the data on both new and exist home sale that were releas earlier this week were consist with our  book forecast   i should also note the situat with regard to the price of singl famili hous   as you know  home price have deceler great  and over the project period  we have them remain close to their current level on a nation averag basi   but our abil to judg the align of price with fundament is limit  to say the least  and a substanti move downward is certain possibl   the bottom right panel illustr that risk by present the es  valuat error accord to the veri simpl model that we show you two year ago in our special present on hous   to be sure  other model deliv differ answer  but this one judg the misalign of the price rent ratio to be histor larg   if price break more sharpli becaus builder decid to clear out inventori more quick  construct activ might well recov fa   even as other consum spend is crimp by the damag to household balanc sheet   which effect would predomin in term of overal aggreg demand is not entir clear   exhibit   focus on busi fix invest   as shown in the top left panel  sale of medium and heavi truck have more or less fallen off a cliff thus far this year  reflect the influenc of new epa regul that took effect on januari    and this has been an import factor hold down overal equip spend   we think that this dynam should be come to a close over the next few month and are look for truck purchas to begin trend up some  dure the second half of this year   as shown in the top right panel  order and shipment of nondefens capit good hit an air pocket around the turn of the year  appar driven down in part by the trial of the motor vehicl and construct industri   howev  the order and shipment data for march and april   the latest that were avail to us when we were put togeth the  book  encourag us to think that a rebound of at least modest proport is in train  and this morn   s releas came in close to our  book expect   moreov  survey of busi condit  includ the two order base index shown in the middl left panel  suggest that busi concur that the situat has brighten somewhat in the past few month   as shown in the first line of the middl right panel  we are project that  over the next six quarter  equip invest will post respect   if unspectacular   increas   two of the variabl condit that view appear at the bottom of the page   as shown on the left  we expect real busi output to grow a littl more slowli over the forecast period than in the preced few year  suggest   all els be equal   somewhat more modest growth in invest than in earlier year   similar  as shown on the right  we expect the user cost of capit for high tech equip  the red line  to continu to declin at about the averag pace of the past few year  and we expect the user cost for non high tech equip  the black line  to be about unchang  much as it has been over the past year and a half   all in all  these factor point to a steadi outlook for busi invest   exhibit   take a slight longer term perspect on the inflat outlook by compar our current project to the one that we had in the januari  book   the last  e you submit project for a monetari polici report   as shown in the top left panel  sinc januari we have revis up our near term forecast for overal pce price inflat but not our longer term outlook   part of the near term revis is due to fa  food price inflat   the top right panel   which in turn reflect  among other thing  the greater pressur that ethanol product has place not onli on the price of corn but also the price of other food that are produc use corn as an input  such as beef  dairi  and poultri   by the end of this year  though  we assum that the livestock and poultri sector have adjust to the higher level of corn price  so we have food price come back in line with core inflat   anoth part of the upward surpris in overal pce inflat is due to a steeper climb in consum energi price   the middl left panel   reflect crude oil price that have been run about     per barrel abov our januari assumpt and refineri outag that have kept util below typic level   but as with food  we have energi price increas moder great over the project period   exclud food and energi   the middl right panel   core pce price inflat has look a littl tamer thus far this year than we expect in januari   nonetheless  our project for core inflat next year is unrevis  on net  relat to the januari  book   the absenc of ani net revis sinc januari reflect a mix of consider   for one thing  not all the news relat to inflat has been good  both import and   as i just note   energi price have been run higher than we expect and thus have been generat more upward pressur on inflat than we had foreseen   for anoth  some of the recent good news seem like to prove relat short live   for exampl  as shown in the bottom left panel  nonmarket base price  which account for about    percent of the core index  have been rise less quick thus far this year than we expect in januari   histor  howev  fluctuat in nonmarket price have not convey much inform about the futur behavior of this seri  so we have trim our project for the increas in this compon of price over the second half of this year by onli a tenth   as shown to the right  both tenant    rent   the black line   and owner    equival rent  or oer   the red line   have deceler late but  as shown by the bar at the bottom of the panel  oer has slow by notic more   histor  differ of this magnitud have not persist long   see  for exampl  the bulg that emerg and then disappear in       moreov  these diverg have tend to be resolv in favor of tenant    rent   accord  we expect the increas in oer over the project period to look more like the recent increas in tenant    rent rather than the other way around   in the end  these influenc happen to rough offset one anoth  leav our core inflat project for next year unchang from januari   exhibit   focus on the recent behavior of inflat expect and  as note in the top left panel  ask whether those expect have move abov level that were typic from mid      through mid        a period when actual core pce inflat was most between   percent and   percent   as note in the last bullet in the box  the answer vari by seri   in the next three panel  i use shade band to indic level of each seri that were typic dure the eight year refer period   the darker band mark the middl    percent of the seri    observ and the lighter band mark the middl    percent of the observ   as shown in the top right panel  the short term expect measur

as you know from the  book  recent news on foreign econom activ has been general upbeat  support our view that growth abroad will continu at a solid pace   the top panel of exhibit    show our weight averag of total foreign gdp growth and our outlook   if our forecast is born out  foreign growth will soften slight over the forecast period  to about     percent  which is also our current best guess of the rate of foreign potenti growth   as you can see from the chart  rate of growth of     percent  the thin horizont line  or better are not unpreced  but a stretch of five consecut year  like that from      to       would be unusu   the chart also show foreign growth maintain most of the momentum it develop over the past coupl of year even as u s  growth has taken a more substanti step down   this is also a bit unusu   howev  as shown in the middl left panel  foreign domest demand gain strength throughout the current expans  leav foreign economi less depend on demand from the unit state   foreign invest spend  in particular  has been pick up  as shown to the right  fix invest spend as a share of gdp has move up a coupl of percentag point sinc        with foreign activ expand slight fa  than potenti  it is not surpris that we are see sign in some foreign economi that labor market slack is dwindl   the unemploy rate in japan  shown in the bottom left panel  is at a nine year low  in canada  the rate is at a thirti year low  and the euro area rate is also at a multiyear low   tight labor market condit are less appar in emerg market economi  although we are hear stori of labor shortag in certain sector in china  where growth has been extrem rapid   what is more appar is that in market for oil and other primari commod  shown in the bottom right panel  demand has outstrip avail suppli  drive price higher   suppli capac is expand  howev  and we are project  consist with futur market  that commod price will flatten out by the end of the forecast period   befor they do  our forecast call for oil price to rise a bit further over the remaind of      and        food commod price are project to move slight higher on averag as well  in part as energi relat demand for grain remain strong   if this forecast is realiz  oil and energi price should impart in come quarter notic but onli moder upward pressur on headlin consum price inflat abroad   in part this is becaus the project increas in oil price is relat modest  at least compar with what we   ve seen in recent year  in addit  the direct effect of oil price on consum price in mani case is damp by tax structur or more activ govern intervent in energi market   the top panel of exhibit     which examin the pass through of crude oil price to gasolin price  provid some evid of how such pass through vari across countri   these panel present local currenc price of unlead gasolin and import crude oil over the past coupl of year or so  plot on a ratio scale so that vertic distanc correspond to percent chang in

consum pay at the pump   the red line   are less volatil in the foreign economi shown than in the unit state and have move up more slowli   in part  this reflect some differ movement in refineri and distribut margin  which are repres by the gap between import crude oil price and retail gasolin price exclud tax  the blue line    this is most notic for japan  where margin are proport higher and more of the increas in crude oil price was absorb than in the unit state and the other countri   in addit  higher gasolin tax abroad have insert a greater wedg between the pre tax price and the retail price of gasolin   the differ between the blue and the red line   accord  increas crude oil price have push up retail gasolin price proport less abroad than in the unit state   the middl left panel present some calcul of the rate at which the chang in crude oil price were pass through to the retail gasolin price between septemb      and march of this year  the most recent observ i have for these countri   dure this period  rate of pass through were lower abroad  particular for japan and germani  the countri with relat high tax   the smaller pass through of oil price to retail gasolin price abroad has also shown through to broader measur of consum energi price   as shown to the right  consum energi price in canada  germani  and japan have increas less than those in the unit state over the past four year   an extra factor hold down energi price inflat in canada over this period was the substanti appreci of the canadian dollar  which made import energi relat cheaper   overal  this suggest that the effect of past increas in global energi price on headlin inflat  as well as on consum sen ent and inflat expect  were like smaller abroad than in the unit state   in mani emerg market economi  gasolin and other retail energi price are control or subsid  so that energi relat fluctuat in consum price  if they occur at all  tend to be gradual   for this group of economi  what has left a bigger imprint on headlin consum price inflat in recent month is the global rise in food price   the black line in the bottom left panel show that food price inflat in mexico has been heavili influenc in recent year by enorm  weather induc swing in domest tomato price inflat  shown in red  of cours     laughter   this year  howev  food price inflat has not follow tomato price inflat down  rather  it has been sustain in part by a sharp acceler in price of tortilla and other corn product  shown by the   line  which are respond to the fuel relat surg in the global price of corn   food price inflat in china  shown to the right in black  has also been boost by higher grain price  as higher feed cost  along with an outbreak of swine flu  have driven up meat and poultri price   price for corn and other grain are forecast to level out by the end of       after they have increas enough to align suppli and demand growth   a risk  of cours  is that further rapid expans of demand might continu to outstrip that of suppli  make food price inflat more persist and more like to spur inflat in other sector   the bank of mexico cite such a risk follow it polici tighten in april  and china   s author have rais concern that food price may exert upward pressur on wage   evid for emerg market economi that inflat pressur might alreadi be spread outsid the food and energi sector is limit so far  howev   the top left panel of exhibit    show core inflat rate in four of our largest emerg market trade partner   china   s core rate  in blue   which exclud onli food  show no sign of wider inflat pressur   in brazil  inflat has declin substanti over the past few year  despit a slight uptick recent   core inflat in korea has been trend upward  but it is still low   mexico   s core inflat rate has edg up toward   percent  a rate that concern mexican author  but this upward trend may mere reflect the fact that core inflat in mexico   not exclud process food such as corn tortilla   the advanc foreign economi appear to be exhibit more broad base inflat pressur   as shown on the right  in canada  the euro area  and the unit kingdom  core inflat has been on a rise trend sinc the middl of      or earlier   in respons  the central bank in all three economi  as well as the bank of japan  are expect to tighten polici in the near term   core inflat is still in general accept rang  howev  except perhap for the bank of japan  for which it might be too low  and market sen ent   not indic concern that inflat pressur are go to rise substanti   as you can see from the middl left panel  ten year govern bond yield in the major market have all risen sinc the begin of the year   except for japan  most of the increas in nomin yield  the first column  can be attribut to higher real yield  shown in the second  which is consist with stronger prospect for growth   the tabl to the right show that survey measur of inflat expect for the year      rose moder for canada between decemb and june and a bit less for the unit kingdom  wherea the measur fell off some for the euro area and japan   longer run inflat expect as of the most recent survey date in april were still lock in at rate consist with inflat target in canada  the euro area  and the unit kingdom  our outlook for headlin inflat abroad  shown in the bottom panel  reflect a diminish inflationari impuls from oil and other primari commod price as they flatten out over the forecast period   it also incorpor the view that some further monetari polici tighten will be need to restrain domest demand and guid inflat in each economi toward it price stabil object by the end of the forecast period   your last two intern exhibit focus on the extent to which extern adjust is under way   a littl more than a year ago  in may  was the last  e we forecast that the u s  current account deficit in      would exceed    trillion   sinc then  as shown in the top left panel of exhibit     our outlook for the current account has improv substanti  so much so that current we don   t see the deficit reach    trillion within our forecast period   as shown to the right  much of the improv has come through an improv outlook for the trade balanc   what surpris us   two like suspect fail to provid the answer   given the recent strength of foreign growth  one might have thought that a year ago we were perhap too pessimist on foreign activ and consequ undershot on u s  export perform   howev  as shown in the middl left panel  our outlook today for foreign econom activ is veri similar to what we had in mind a year ago  similar  the declin over the past year in the broad real dollar  shown to the right  which has help curb the deterior in the trade balanc  has turn out to be not much differ from our forecast a year ago   part of the answer  it turn out  is that  even though the assumpt we fed our model for export have not prove much off the mark  our model forecast for core export  shown at the bottom left  fail to catch the unusu strong growth of export in        we attribut this miss to the composit of foreign demand rather than it overal magnitud   as shown in the tabl to the right  the largest contributor to growth of u s  core export in      were in the categori of capit good  line    and industri suppli  line      with capit good make up a larg fraction of core export  the rise in foreign invest as a share of gdp  mention earlier  like provid a boost to core export abov that indic by our aggreg measur of foreign gdp   similar  the global commod boom like favor u s  export of industri suppli   addit factor behind the improv outlook for the u s  current account are describ in exhibit      one is the lower path of u s  real gdp  shown in the top left panel  which prompt real import of core good  shown to the right  to expand along a shallow trajectori than we had predict last year   a third factor  illustr in the middl left panel  is that we did not forecast the dip in the price of oil in the second half of       which reduc the valu of oil import substanti   these three factor explain the bulk of the upward adjust in our forecast for the trade balanc in        in addit  the improv outlook for the current account reflect an upward revis to net invest incom  shown in the middl right   this adjust result from a number of factor  includ new data on u s  hold of direct invest abroad  new procedur for determin interest payment to foreign holder of u s  treasuri  and a chang in the methodolog use to record interest flow on cross border hold of other fix incom secur   as a result of these surpris  the extern account have clear improv   go forward  we expect the current account deficit to resum widen nonetheless as interest payment on the net extern debt mount   but the combin of solid  demand driven foreign growth and weaker u s  growth has led the extern account to make a more posit contribut to u s  gdp growth in the near term  as shown in the tabl   in our current forecast  shown in the rightmost column  we project that the arithmet contribut of real net export to gdp growth should be rough neutral start in the second half of this year  as strong foreign growth help sustain real export gain that match those of real import
thank you   that was an excel report   we have  e now for some question for our colleagu   ani question   presid
aircraft constitut what share of capit good export  and might they have someth to do with the competit situat  particular between boe and airbus
aircraft are an import factor in this   in the fourth quarter of last year  boe was essenti export all the aircraft it could produc  so come into the first quarter  we didn   t get much more becaus there weren   t ani more to sell  but that issu has been import   i don   t know to what extent boe has benefit from the fact that airbus has had some hard  e  but i suspect it has gotten some benefit from that
aircraft are rough   percent of export
five percent of capit good or of total export
more like    percent of capit good and   percent of export
i want to take   back to exhibit   and tri to pin him down  although i am not veri hope    laughter   you took us back to the period from      to mid       in which inflat  by the core pce measur  was between   and   almost all the  e   i think the onli except was basic the last few month of        core inflat averag someth like     percent   you take these three survey measur there and look at them   what i took away from your assess was that you view these as rough consist with that period   is that fair
i would say that the answer differ by seri  so that if you tend to favor the short term michigan seri shown in the top right  you might get a more alarm pictur   but  for exampl  the survey of profession forecast    ten year ahead seri is all the way at the other end of the spectrum  have been essenti rock solid at     percent  and these other seri fall somewher in between   obvious  this analysi is extraordinarili simpl and  sn   t take into account other factor that may have been at work over that eight year refer period that are not oper now   but the hope was that  on a veri rough and readi basi  this might be broad indic and that an eight year period might captur some variat in other factor that were influenc inflat
i am wholli on board with you there   what i was most curious about was what you took away from this for your core inflat outlook  which you have go to     real soon and stay there  and whether you view current expect as broad similar to this period and your forecast as consist with that period   or do you view expect and your forecast as potenti at varianc with that period  or some combin of the two
i think we view the current constel of expect measur as not provid much impetus either upward or downward on inflat   it is just not go to be an import factor shape the contour of inflat in our view
okay   a question i had   and mayb vinc can help with this   is that the tip measur obvious don   t go back that far  and go back onli as far as they go  my sens is that most analyst don   t view them in the earliest period in which we have quotat as repres price and market liquid enough to give us a sens   i guess      is around the borderlin of the reliabl period   in       those tip spread for the next five year were down well into the   to   percent rang  veri close to     percent   do you folk view the tip spread in the year or two lead to      as someth out of which we should take ani inform about inflat expect
well  there is a pictur in the lower right panel of chart   in the bluebook
it goe back onli to         sn   t it
yes  that is right
well  i was look at  book part    page ii     and it goe back to
in my convers with some of the tip analyst on our staff  they suggest  as consist with your statement  that      was  rough speak  the period in their view in which the tip market emerg into the modern era with some tighter price
so there is some inform content there   are you give me some comfort in that regard
i think the thing to note  presid    is that  if you look at the term structur of tip compens  the five year  five year forward in that has been a whole lot more stabl   the quot you are look at are veri much influenc by the first five year   in fact  at the end of       again in       and in the middl of       the first five year    inflat compens fell below     percent
the tip spread measur
yes  the tip inflat compens measur   dure the same period  howev  the five year  five year forward basic bounc up and down around     percent
right   so the longer run expect mayb weren   t so anchor or weren   t tie to the middl of this period   but we had a period in which there was an indic that expect over the near term were around       i guess the thing i would be curious about  and mayb vinc   s present is a more appropri  e to address this question   i would be happi to defer it until then   is that view      to      as sort of a distinct period in which we nail thing between   and   for a while suggest think about the transit from       forward a coupl of year as a transit out of price stabil defin that way and whether we can take ani lesson from that for the potenti cost of a transit back to a period like that
mr  chairman   i just want to thank    in particular  for that excel present on the intern dimens of this   it was  l  or euro  or whatev the express would be in term of it excel   i have a tutori question about the export figur   i assum servic are not includ in core export   is that correct
no  that is just good
are our servic export increas more rapid than our non servic export   do you know   would they be a possibl sourc of explan for the improv trade balanc
they are a possibl sourc   they were my fourth factor  if i had gone on longer    laughter   they were neck and neck with the oil import in term of their contribut to the improv outlook for trade
well  thank you   that was an excel present
just a question about scale   regard exhibit    serious mortgag delinqu rate   when you refer to adjust rate go to almost    percent of loan  is that of adjust rate loan   what is the total dollar valu the    percent is against
the serious delinqu rate is for the pool of adjust rate subprim loan  and they repres about   percent of the outstand mortgag
okay   and the total outstand mortgag are what dollar amount
there is     trillion in mortgag outstand
that is what i thought   i just want to make sure   thank you
but to make sure that is right  the red line are subprim
the red line are subprim
subprim adjust rate loan are about   percent of outstand  and subprim fix loan are anoth   percent of outstand   that would be   percent of the     trillion in total mortgag
although the percentag are by number of mortgag rather than by valu  i think
by dollar it is veri similar
are there other question   presid
also  on exhibit    the net worth chart in the top left hand corner   i thought i heard you say that this was high by histor standard   so there are two thing here   the stock market has been strong  and then hous price have been veri weak   i assum if you run this out into anoth year  the line is go to keep go down as well   i was just wonder if you could expand on this   is this higher than you expect it to be at this particular  e
if we had start this seri in the earli      s  this would be the high   we have the stock market bubbl of      in here  and it has come off  but it is      even at the end of the project period  it is      e dispos incom   that is histor high   befor        it would have been about     or
we do inde forecast it to continu to declin over the next year or so  in larg measur becaus  as   show in his chart  we still think this hous price adjust has to proceed further befor we get into a better equilibrium   our assumpt on the stock price  of cours  is pretti neutral becaus we have it go up pretti close to the overal rate of nomin incom  so i think the downward tilt is be driven most by the hous price stori
on a longer term trend basi  where would you expect it to stabil or to level out
take this for what it is worth  which isn   t a whole lot   laughter   thank you   it drop just a bit  it is between     and    over the longer haul and just gradual declin back in that direct
presid hoenig  i think i interrupt you   i   m sorri
this is the number of loan   then do you have ani idea what the percentag of the dollar amount of loan is in delinqu
we think there is probabl      billion to    trillion in adjust rate subprim mortgag outstand
so about the same   okay
i wasn   t sure i heard correct   what was the averag ratio of wealth to dispos incom over the      s rough
the number i recal is     as the long run averag sinc the      s   presid  n
i want to go back to the surpris in net export onc again   i don   t quit rememb the argument  but it seem to me we use to worri a lot about small foreign elast of demand for u s  good and servic when the dollar declin or when incom growth differenti chang   has what we have seen late affect your view about that
i would say it hasn   t affect our view in the sens that we haven   t chang the elast that we are use on the basi of this one year   s observ  but it point in the right direct   i mean  we are get a littl bit more    umph    from foreign growth than we thought befor   whether it is go to be a one  e miss relat to aircraft   there was some temporari invest surg in foreign economi  and we are a capit good export  and we are just take advantag of that  and it is go to go back   or whether it persist is a littl too earli to tell   but it is possibl
we have updat the elast sinc ten year ago   when you first heard us natter on about the unsustain of the u s  current account situat  we had perhap a more extrem view of those elast   if you drop out the     s and you restrict your es  to a more recent period  you tend to get elast that move toward each other a littl   but the basic asymmetri is still there  and we haven   t respond to      in some specif way   we   re let a littl more  e go by to see what happen go forward
in exhibit    the averag initi rate on the stock of mortgag that you are look at for reset over the next coupl of year is about     percent  what is rough the current rate for subprim fix rate loan
it is around   percent   if you get on the internet and tri to find a subprim fix rate loan  it would be about that   we can   t find an offici seri  but rough
so they are face a     percent payment shock if they stick with the mortgag   but if they were abl to switch to a fix rate product  it is about     percent
that   s right  right now
if there are no other question     could i call on you to talk about the econom project
sure   thank you  mr  chairman   as was evid in the survey respons summar in the memo of june    on your attitud toward the econom project  there seem to be broad agreement among you on the key featur of the process   where there was not  includ about share forecast  the specif of the monetari polici assumpt  and the character of uncertainti  the subcommitte on communic tri to find common ground  the result was reflect in the survey on the econom outlook for this meet  which i will discuss with the aid of the materi distribut with the cover    econom project of fomc particip      as can be seen by compar the bold with the italic number in the first exhibit  there were onli minor chang in your project of real gdp growth  the unemploy rate  and core pce inflat over the next two and one half year from those you submit in may   given the favor data over the intermeet period  you rais your real growth forecast a notch and lower the core pce inflat forecast for        still  as plot in the top panel of exhibit    the red bar show the central tendenc of your forecast indic that most of you anticip that gdp growth will be somewhat soft this year but will pick up a bit over      and       although the submiss were not specif about potenti output growth   and not all of you would agre that it is even a use concept   this expans of real output would seem initi to be slower than that of capac in that the central tendenc for the unemploy rate  the second panel  edg higher   with resourc market less taut and perhap some transitori factor eb  core pce inflat  the third panel  drift down   in this experi  you were ask for inflat read come from two measur system   the histor wedg between inflat measur by the core pce price index and the total consum price index is about    percentag point  the central tendenc project for those two seri in      and      are about that far apart  lead to the infer that you are not forecast signific chang to the relat price of energi and food   the subcommitte suggest forecast these two inflat seri in the spirit of experiment   some  in the next two day  you might want to express how use you found that part of the experi   anoth notabl featur of your project is that the differ among them widen  rather than narrow  the further into the futur you forecast   this suggest a divers of view as to key attribut of the economi as well as where you believ inflat should be head in the long run   as for the assumpt about monetari polici under these outcom  about two third of you indic general agreement with the path laid out in the  book   as for the other  there were explan advanc for be on either side of the staff assumpt     materi use by mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix      you were also ask to provid a qualit character of your uncertainti about your outlook   the result for real gdp growth are given in the top panel of exhibit     somewhat surpris  there was no lake wobegon effect  and the preponder of respons view the real gdp growth outlook as just about as uncertain as has been the case on averag over the past twenti year   as shown in the bottom panel  a major of the submiss indic that the risk around the project for gdp growth are judg to be broad balanc   this contrast with the indic in the may minut that  although the risk to econom activ had    diminish slight     they were still    weight to the downsid      for some  the incom news may have led to a reassess of the risk to econom growth   for other  it may reflect a view that the main downsid risk to activ are concentr in the near term and those risk further ahead are broad symmetr   to shed light on this issu  particip might want to address the main risk to econom growth and whether they are still judg to be weight to the downsid as had been the case in your may discuss   some more detail about your forecast of the unemploy rate is provid in exhibit     a major of the project embodi a more mute rise in the unemploy rate than in the  book forecast  the dash vertic line  this smaller expect increas may part reflect the stronger outlook for gdp growth suggest by mani of your project   but then again  it may not    laughter  from the comment in the narrat about the like strength of trend growth  it is not clear that the project growth in output relat to trend is expect to be materi more robust than that suggest by the staff   s forecast     the more modest project rise in unemploy reflect a differ in view from the staff   s about the rate of growth of potenti output  the unemploy rate associ with no chang in the inflat rate  cyclic movement in product  or other factor   exhibit   provid a talli of the year by year inflat outlook   a major of the project have a more benign medium term outlook for core inflat than that suggest by the staff   s forecast   but the respons to the question about the appropri path of interest rate indic that for a major of project this   not stem from a signific tighter stanc of monetari polici than assum by the staff   likewis  the project for gdp growth and unemploy do not appear to impli greater econom slack than expect by the staff   for some  this more mark moder in inflat may reflect a judgment that more of the rise in core inflat reflect the effect of temporari influenc  such as the rise in energi price and owner    equival rent  that are like to abat over the forecast period   for other  it may reflect an assess that the nairu is lower than that assum by the staff or that inflat expect may edg lower over the forecast period  perhap pull down by feder reserv communic   you might wish to exchang view about the main factor contribut to the expect moder in inflat in your forecast   as to where inflat is head in the longer run  mani of you indic that the third year project  the bottom panel  reflect to a consider degre your polici goal rather than initi condit   if that is the case  the central tendenc reveal that most of you individu defin the inflat rate that best fo  the dual mandat to be     to   percent when measur by the core pce inflat rate   given your appar belief about futur movement in the relat price of food and energi  discuss earlier  you would also seem to think that total pce inflat should place within a rang of     to   percent   as for the process from here on  if you would like to chang your forecast in light of the discuss at this meet or data receiv sinc you prepar your project  we ask that you submit your revis to the secretariat by close of busi friday  unless we are instruct differ as a result of the discuss tomorrow  the staff will draft a minut style narrat descript of the econom project   this will be a standalon document that will circul with the draft minut on the regular schedul as was the case in may   one last point   your final exhibit give the tradit present of your econom project that will be made public in the monetari polici report and includ in the publish minut   if you want to chang your submiss  pleas let us know by friday   how you judg the use of this exhibit compar with the forecast compil for the experi presum will be one topic for discuss tomorrow   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you      thank for remind us that this project count in some sens  right    laughter   also  i think it is veri use for us to have the disciplin of think about how our project fit togeth   are there question for     if not  then we can begin our econom go round   who would like to go first   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   data relat to both econom activ and inflat dure the intermeet period have been encourag   econom indic have strengthen consider  and recent read on core inflat have been quit tame   although a portion of the recent deceler of core price like reflect transitori influenc  the under trend in core inflat is still quit favor  i view the condit for growth go forward as be reason solid   the main negat factor are tie to hous   the latest data don   t point to an immin recoveri in this sector  and i fear that the recent run up in mortgag rate will onli make matter wors   in addit  hous price are unlik to rise over the next few year and  inde  may well fall  and the absenc of the hous wealth gain realiz in the past should damp consumpt spend   i agre with the  book that the recent run up in bond and mortgag rate reflect primarili a shift in market expect for the path of polici and  therefor  impli onli a small subtract to my forecast for growth in       in my view  the stanc of monetari polici over the next few year should be chosen to help move labor and product market from be somewhat tight today to exhibit a modest degre of slack in order to help bring about a further gradual reduct in inflat toward a level consist with price stabil   the stanc of monetari polici will need to remain modest restrict  along the line assum in the  book and by market  in order to achiev that goal   my forecast is for growth to be around     percent in the second half of this year and in       slight below my es  of potenti growth  and for the unemploy rate to edg up gradual  reach near   percent by the end of next year  under these condit  core inflat should continu to reced gradual  with the core pce price index increas   percent this year and     percent in        this forecast is predic on continu well anchor inflat expect and the eventu appear of a small amount of labor market slack   in addit  special factor such as rise energi price and the sustain run up in owner    equival rent that have boost inflat should ebb over  e  contribut a bit to the expect declin in core inflat  in term of risk to the outlook for growth  i still feel the presenc of a     pound gorilla in the room  and that is the hous sector   the risk for further signific deterior in the hous market  with hous price fall and mortgag delinqu rise further  caus me appreci angst   inde  the repercuss of fall hous price are alreadi play out in some area where past price rise were especi rapid and subprim lend soar   for exampl  in the sacramento metropolitan area east of san francisco  hous price shot up at an annual rate of more than    percent from      to        sinc then  howev  they have been fall at an annual rate of     percent  delinqu on subprim mortgag rose sharpli last year  put sacramento at the top of the list of msas in term of the chang in the rate of subprim delinqu  research by my staff examin metropolitan area across the countri indic that the experi of sacramento reflect a more general pattern   they found that low rate of hous price appreci  and especi hous price deceler  are associ with increas in delinqu rate even after control for local econom condit such as employ growth and the unemploy rate   one possibl explan for these find is that subprim borrow  especi those with veri low equiti stake  have less incent to keep their mortgag current when hous no longer seem an attract invest  either becaus price have deceler sharpli or interest rate have risen   these result highlight the potenti risk that rise default in subprim could spread to other sector of the mortgag market and could trigger a vicious cycl in which a further deceler in hous price increas foreclosur  in turn exacerb downsid price movement  the risk to inflat are also signific   in addit to the upsid risk associ with continu tight labor market  a slowdown in product growth could add to cost pressur   although recent product data have been disappoint  i express some op  at the last meet about product growth on the ground that at least some of the slowdown appear to reflect labor hoard and lag in the adjust of employ to output  especi in the construct industri   data sinc that meet have reinforc my op  concern trend product growth   in particular  new data in the recent releas busi employ dynam report suggest that product growth may have been stronger than we have been think  this report  which includ data that will be use in the rebenchmark of the payrol survey in januari  show a much smaller increas in employ in the third quarter of      than is report in the payrol survey  it  therefor  impli a larger increas in output per worker  a second risk to inflat is slippag in the market   s percept of our inflat object   although inflat compens over the next five year is essenti unchang sinc our last meet  long run breakeven inflat rate impli by the differ between nomin and index treasuri secur are up about    basi point  howev  our analysi suggest that this increas reflect in good part an elev in risk premium or the influenc of various   let me call them    idiosyncrat      factor of the type that bill   mention  such as a possibl shift in the demand by foreign central bank for treasuri or special factor affect the demand for inflat index secur and not an increas in long run inflat expect   we base this conclus on the fact that long run breakeven inflat rate have also climb in the unit kingdom   a countri where inflat expect have been remark well anchor over the past decad and where inflat has been trend downward   the fact that breakeven inflat rate rose in both countri  despit their differ monetari polici regim  suggest that a common explan is need rather than one specif to the unit state   i think this conclus is support by the board staff model that attribut about half of the movement in breakeven inflat to risk premium   that said  our understand and es  of risk premium are imprecis  so we must continu to monitor inflat expect veri care   of cours  along with everyth els   laughter
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   condit in the seventh district have chang littl sinc my last report   overal activ in the district is lag the nation  main becaus of the continu difficulti of what we now call the detroit three  former known as the big three   laughter  and their supplier   but other sector of our region are do better   notabl  a number of manufactur outsid auto   and consum spend is move forward at a moder rate  look at the outlook for the nation economi  the  book baselin forecast has growth recov to potenti and core inflat stabil at   percent   our outlook is not much differ   we see growth return close to potenti   assum that monetari polici maintain it slight restrict stanc  we think inflat will edg a shade below   percent by        that would be a good outcom  and i sure hope we get it  the biggest news sinc the may fomc meet is the adjust in financi condit   the chang in fed fund futur bring market expect into better align with what i think will be the appropri path for monetari polici   i   m not sure  howev  how much restraint we can expect from the increas in long term interest rate   as the chairman heard from our director last week  the effect can be mute by ampl liquid in the financi market   one of our director  who head a larg privat equiti firm  say that he   not see much of a chang in the lend environ  financ for even high risk project continu to be readili avail at quit favor rate and term   notabl  such loan are be made with few coven and no automat default trigger  of cours  the hous market remain a risk   like the  book  we continu to expect larg declin in residenti invest through the end of this year  and i remain concern that builder may need to cut back even more to reduc the high inventori of unsold home   our detroit branch director  who is cfo of pult home  note that two third of their sale usual occur between the super bowl and memori day   sale this year in that period were sluggish and relat unrespons to price discount   accord  he is not look for a turnaround in hous market befor         anoth director  the head of u s  gypsum  agre that it would be       befor we could expect a pickup in hous  with regard to consum spend more general  some contact note the impact of higher gasolin price   a develop of mall and shop center downgrad his expect for the rest of       but he is not over pessimist and is expect retail sale in the second half to remain near their first half pace   both gm and ford believ that the higher gasolin price are hold down the overal level of motor vehicl sale in addit to move the mix of sale away from suv and toward car   at this point  they believ that higher interest rate are have onli a margin effect on demand  both are predict that total light vehicl sale will be about      million unit in       that is the same as the pace predict by the particip in our annual outlook symposium that we held in detroit earlier this month  but the rest of the manufactur is do better than auto   produc of heavi machineri and agricultur equip continu to report strong demand   the chicago purchas manag    report  which is confidenti until it releas this friday  was      in june  that read is down onli a bit from it veri high one of      in may   some of this strength reflect strong growth abroad  which is fuel the demand for u s  product  as we talk about dure the chart show   inde  i think that there may be some upsid risk to the gdp forecast from fa  than expect export growth   labor market continu to be strong  and we heard the usual stori about select labor shortag and associ increas in wage   one except is the soft demand for temporari worker  but this could be normal for a matur busi cycl  turn to price  our contact seem to be a bit more pessimist about the prospect for inflat   we heard concern that higher energi price would boost transport cost and that the demand for food stuff from abroad and the boom domest ethanol market are push up food price   in contrast to the anecdot  the incom data on core inflat were better than expect   our indic model revis down a tenth or two from the last round  they now have core pce inflat be about   percent this year and next and then edg down to     or     in        without ani meaning resourc slack  this improv would requir a compar adjust in inflat expect  which may be difficult given a prolong period of core inflat at or abov   percent   so i continu to think that the predomin risk remain that inflat will not moder as expect

mr  chairman  for the sake of consist  i will refer to my report at the last two meet on what i call the goldilock porridg classif system   i report last that the intern economi was hot  and it remain so as we saw in the excel slide present   i report that the domest economi was cold   i believ it remain so  in contrast i think to the previous two intervent  at least from a growth perspect   i also report that the eleventh district  home of the nba champion  vanquish of the   shall i say    more cavali       fourth district   laughter  was just right   it remain so in relat term   i would say that it has weaken somewhat and cool somewhat in absolut term  i just want to comment quick on the intern side of the domest economi  with the hope of ad on the margin to the staff   s excel work in

thank you  mr  chairman   regard the nation economi and real growth  it seem to me that recent develop are unfold to a consider extent larg as anticip   growth was posit but subdu over the four quarter end in the first quarter of this year   it appar snap back discern in the current quarter  and my forecast is for sustain growth around trend go forward   in examin the twelv month period span the last three quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year  it is appar that the slow of aggreg demand went beyond the hous sector and  in fact  was fair broad base   to be sure  residenti construct activ contract persist and substanti over those four quarter   in addit  spend on equip and softwar bare advanc  feder govern outlay were soft in real term  and there was a signific inventori correct   in most case  with the like and perhap obvious except of residenti construct  there are reason to believ  base on some of the indic that     cover this afternoon as well as materi distribut befor the meet  that these compon of demand   that is  spend on equip and softwar  feder govern outlay  and inventori   will strengthen go forward   i thought it was particular hearten  as note in part   of the  book  that appar the inventori overhang in construct suppli and in auto has been work off  which suggest that we should see improv in those sector go forward   as i have comment befor at recent meet  i think the outlook for nonresidenti construct  for net export  and for consum spend remain posit  although not unduli exuber   all of this fit reason well with my view of what we should expect from product gain go forward  as well as increas in employ and hour work   so  overal  i think the outlook for the real economi is promis and favor  as to inflat  there has been  as everybodi has note  some moder in the core measur recent   i expect this perform to continu  not necessarili on a month by month basi but over  e   overal  my read of monetari polici is that it is moder restrict   as a consequ  that should feed into a further  gradual diminut of inflat along with eb of some of the transitori factor that push it up for a  e   i would add that anecdot from our busi contact don   t suggest ani chang in price power or acceler of inflat at this point  now  of cours  risk to the outlook abound  as they alway do  and mani have alreadi been mention   sever relat  of cours  to hous   construct activ  home price  mortgag relat paper  and so forth   then  you can add uncertainti associ with energi price  the run up in long term interest rate that has alreadi occur  and i am sure a few thing that i haven   t enumer   i wouldn   t want to sound over complac or sanguin  but i would observ that mani of these risk are not new  mani of them are alreadi built into the  book or other forecast   in ani event  if one of them were to occur in isol  i would doubt that it would have a profound effect on the outlook that i have describ   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the pace of growth in new england  at least as measur by employ  remain below that of the nation   inde  sinc the trough of the last recess  new england   s job have grown at less than half the pace of the nation as a whole   some of this is the tradit slower pace of job format in the region  and some is undoubt the result of the kind of industri   telecommun and technolog more general   that were hardest hit in the      recess and have yet to recov fulli   but some of it also revolv around issu of suppli   almost everi firm  larg or small  comment on the difficulti of find skill labor   there is also reason to believ that  at least relat to the rest of the nation  the suppli versus demand imbal may be a particular issu in the region   this come from the confer board   s onlin job post measur  which for some  e has shown new england as have the highest number of advertis job open relat to the size of the labor forc   contact report that they are will to offer   and do offer   higher pay to get the skill they need  but find the worker is harder to do and take longer than earlier in the cycl  anoth issu that came up again in our round of contact is the pervas rise in the cost of almost ani metal  but especi copper and aluminum   contact at one veri larg diversifi compani specul about china   s stockpil valuabl metal  whatev the caus  worldwid demand is strong  and price are rise for all type of metal input   some firm report progress in pass on those price increas   inde  larger manufactur compani appear to be buoy  if not driven  by strength in foreign market   one firm report that their boom aircraft busi requir such long hour and continu stress on skill worker to figur out way to meet demand that employe turnov had tripl   not surpris  year over year manufactur export for the region rose in the first quarter  elsewher  news in the region has been fair posit  with busi confid rise and commerci real estat market good and improv throughout   residenti real estat market remain slow   regardless of what measur is use  the region   s home price appear to have slow more than the nation   s   howev  although we had led the nation   this is not someth in which you want to lead the nation   in the rate of rise foreclosur initi  especi for those relat to subprim mortgag  the pace of this growth has subsid   inde  initi of subprim foreclosur went down in the region most recent   moreov  in the most recent data on home sale  the northeast was a bright spot   i have specul befor that the new england residenti real estat market could be bottom out   such thought may remain in the categori more of a hope than a certainti  but perhap the pace of declin is slow   final  while consum confid has been bounci recent  probabl from concern about gasolin price  demand seem reason strong as gaug by local retail   softwar and it firm are show consider strength  and at least in our region  so is temporari help  coincid indic of region health also show solid growth for all six state   in sum  the region appear to be do fair well  and except for residenti real estat  there are perhap grow sign of price and resourc pressur  in that regard not unlik the nation as a whole  turn to the nation  i was pleas to see that incom data valid the substanti pickup in second quarter growth that we  along with the  book  had forecast   inde  outsid of residenti invest  incom data have depict an economi that is grow at a relat healthi pace   data on shipment and order of capit good have improv  consum demand seem relat well maintain despit high gas and soft home price  and payrol data show littl sign of dwindl labor demand   market have at last decid to adopt the committe   s more posit outlook on econom prospect  and credit was repric as a result   i view this event as healthi   it has temper our gdp forecast slight  but the continu ebulli of equiti market is an import offset   as i note at our last meet  we find ourselv a bit more op ist than the  book about trend in residenti real estat  base on new hous start and data on new home sale most recent  and we have moder the pace of declin of residenti invest for the second quarter just a bit relat to our may forecast   the april valu of nonresidenti construct put in place was a clear posit as well   the health of the rest of the world continu to surpris  and we  like the  book  expect littl drag from net export over the forecast period  turn to project for      and       the factor shape our outlook haven   t chang much   we continu to see output acceler mild as the hous situat moder and more of the under strength of the economi show through   this is temper a bit both by rise long term interest rate and by our expect that consum will mend their way a bit   consum less and save more   this hasn   t shown sign of happen yet   by the end of       gdp is about at potenti  unemploy has tick up a bit but remain below   percent  and core inflat move down gradual to   percent   again  not much chang and certain within the central tendenc of member    forecast   one obvious risk to this forecast lie in hous  as everybodi has said   but as i note at our last meet  the longer there are no obvious spinoff from the subprim problem to the wider economi  the more that particular risk seem to ebb  inde  as we have yet to see the save rate pick up with the moder in consumpt over what would be expect by the fundament  there may be some upsid to growth  pressur from abroad   worldwid expans of somewhat larger size than we expect   do rais some upsid issu  both for growth and for inflat  on the inflat side  it is true that the april and may core data were encourag  howev  those number were domin by temporari rather than perman effect  at least in our view   so we haven   t moder our forecast of core inflat  as have the  book author  albeit they moder it onli in a veri minor way  and i remain concern about upsid risk   headlin cpi inflat has been strong   the unemploy rate and widen concern about input cost suggest that pressur to rais price might have grown  and strong growth worldwid affect not onli input price but the valu of the dollar as well   if anyth  sinc our last meet  i think that risk relat to growth have abat and have becom more balanc and risk regard inflat have grown   thus  as we look over the next two and a half year  our forecast see polici stay somewhat restrict given the inflat risk and then eas a bit in late      or      to a level closer to it equilibrium rate  final  continu some thought i began to articul at our last meet  as we think about polici  we also need to be concern about financi stabil   this is particular true given what we   ve seen in the market for credit deriv   we   ve talk befor about how high level of liquid and low interest rate worldwid caus much reach for risk  much reach for return  and relat risk take   while the bear stearn hedg fund issu may well not have leg  the concern regard valuat of the under instrument do give one paus   can market adequ arriv at price for some of the more exot cdo tranch   what happen when the bottom fall out and posit thought to be at least somewhat liquid becom illiquid   is there a potenti for this to spread and becom a system problem   mayb not  and i am not advoc our take ani action as a central bank   but i do think the size of the credit deriv market  it lack of transpar  and it activ relat to subprim debt could be a gather cloud in the background of polici   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   news from the fourth district is littl chang from my last report   the district economi continu to be weigh down by weak in the hous market  and there is general consensus among my contact that the hous sector has not yet seen bottom   to date  advers spillov from hous to other sector of the economi have not been observ  although this remain a signific risk to the outlook  while i have heard some report from my busi contact that the labor market is strengthen  the offici data still do not show net employ growth in the region  my project for the nation economi still call for growth to resum to a more typic expansionari pace as we move beyond        my project for gdp is slight stronger than what is seen in the latest  book becaus of my assumpt for slight stronger growth in potenti   obvious  i don   t make that judgment with great confid  howev  the busi leader i talk with tell me that their plan to expand capit are consist with a pickup in product growth from it recent cyclic low   this includ the cleveland cavali    laughter    a franchis which  as mani of you know  experienc a substanti product shortfal against the san antonio spur a coupl of week ago    laughter   here  too  we are project a good rebound  so to speak  in        in the mean   i would like the record to show that i am make good on my wager with presid     i brought with me a select of cleveland   s finest  and i will present those to   after this meet with my heartfelt congratul   i am put this back  becaus it feel funni have a beer bottl in my hand    laughter
if this were the australian reserv bank  it would be okay   laughter
i also extend my heartfelt congratul to the spur on their fourth and final nba championship    laughter   now  turn to inflat  i am hear report of upward price pressur across a hand of industri commod  and notabl for metal   but wage pressur remain modest   nevertheless  for the first  e in more than a year  i am hear from my busi contact that they are concern about inflat   they are bring inflat concern up with me  and they are tell me that they concur with the committe   s assess that inflat remain a risk   to be sure  there were mani posit sign in the may cpi report   the tradit core cpi beat expect  and while the trim mean es  that we produc in cleveland were a littl higher than the measur exclud food and energi  even those indic were consist with the moder and the longer term inflat trend we expect to see  look at the core measur enabl me to be encourag by the may cpi report   but that view is a rather hard sell to a public that saw headlin cpi inflat rise     percent at an annual rate last month   inde  our read of the under inflat trend and what peopl are feel in their wallet have been at odd for mani year now  i understand that our polici are not well advis or even equip to address transitori price movement   but at some point  larg and persist price disturb  such as we have seen in energi market  warrant our attent   if these isol price pressur becom more general and enter into consum and busi decisionmak  we could easili find ourselv live in the  book   s    drift inflat expect    scenario  in summari  i think the hous market still present a risk that the economi may not resum a more typic growth trajectori over the forecast period   nonetheless  that concern is trump by the risk that we may yet lose the public   s confid that we are make sustain progress against inflat   therefor  i continu to believ that the predomin risk go forward is that inflat will fail to moder as expect   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   let me talk first about some of the anecdot report   a contact with a larg softwar compani suggest that the it industri is do fine   labor is veri tight becaus technic peopl are in such scarc suppli   this compani is expand develop facil in china and india   they are not allow to import the labor they need  and so they will send the oper abroad  my contact with transport industri peopl get the same inform that     is emphas   movement of good is just realli  realli flat   the over the road truck industri is actual take down capac  sell off the older  less effici truck   in the express busi  up is take down capac   fedex is more op ist  probabl take market share   a contact with the fast food industri say that their busi volum is down   the whole industri is down   sale revenu are up a bit  but it is becaus of price increas   the casual dine industri is down even more  there is sort of a disconnect here between the overal view of the economi  i think  and the anecdot report that come from the movement of good   of cours  the most cyclic part of the economi is alway the good part   the servic part is much more stabl   perhap what is go on here is simpli what is also in the  book   s second quarter number  becaus the good part of the economi   consumpt   is pretti flat   i think consumpt is onli   i forget the exact number       or someth  that is an annual rate   you have to divid that by   to tell you what is actual go on in the quarter itself   of cours  the hous industri continu to declin   so mayb these anecdot report realli are consist with what is go on and what is in the  book pictur   the  book pictur make a lot of sens to me  let me talk a littl more about hous   the staff present had a point that i want to underscor   that the hous downturn is unlik ani other that we have had   i think the chart went back to       but you could go back befor that   if you look at the hous downturn and the recess of the     s  they were all relat to a veri standard cyclic pattern   interest rate would rise  hous   start  permit  construct   would start to turn down well befor the cycl peak  and then hous would start to recov after the cycl peak as interest rate came down   the current situat is complet differ from that standard pattern   here we had a hous boom driven by a period of veri low interest rate   the period realli got start when we were hold the fed fund rate at   percent   then you had a lot of these financi innov and subprim mortgag that ad a sector to the market that hadn   t tradit been there   interest rate came up  hous price are flatten out  and my concern is that there is a lot more to go   this is an asset market that   not work anyth like secur market   it is complet differ from the stock market and the bond market  hous start and permit peak in the earli part of last year  and the adjust realli got under way   but if you think about how much of the adjust is complet   well  there is not much sign that much is complet becaus the inventori of unsold new hous is close to it peak   there is no convinc evid that it is realli start to come down   we have seen some bankruptci of builder  but not veri mani   a lot of bank   i know from our contact   are put pressur on their builder to sell out their hous and pay off the loan   the same thing is true of    the ground     as the real estat peopl like to put it   builder are stop their develop of new land for hous develop becaus they don   t have the financ to support it anymor   the bank are start to turn off the credit spigot becaus these compani are get pretti close to the edg   they have laid off a larg number of worker  but they have to sell out their inventori   still  the number of month    suppli that they are sit on is abnorm high  it realli hasn   t come down   we also know that price in this market respond with a veri substanti lag to the under determin of price   so price of exist home are onli gradual adjust  and i think there is probabl more of that to go  we know that there will be a lot more reset of these adjust rate mortgag  the project are that a lot more default than we have yet seen will occur in that area  so i think that we have a long adjust to go here   whether that will spread into the rest of the economi  i don   t know   i share the  book es  that probabl there won   t be major fallout  but it seem to me that the risk there is signific   i just want to underscor that point becaus i think this risk is by far the biggest that we face at this  e   thank you

thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc our last meet  the news in the third district economi has been mix but  on balanc  slight more posit than the previous report   the district continu to grow at a moder pace  and we expect that pace to continu   the bright spot sinc our last meet is a rebound in region manufactur activ  which had been flat for the past six month   in june  the philadelphia busi outlook survey index of current activ rose sharpli      percentag point   from a level of       this is the highest level it has obtain sinc april        the index of new order also show a sizabl jump  and capit spend plan firm in the survey   respond also expect further improv in manufactur activ over the come month  job growth in the region  howev  was somewhat slower over the past two month compar with earlier in the year  but we realli didn   t expect much sinc payrol seem to rise much more rapid than expect dure the first quarter   year to date payrol growth is run about     percent at an annual rate   that rate is slower than the nation averag but is fair typic of our region  where popul growth is rather flat   labor forc particip is rather flat as well   unemploy rate  howev  remain low in our three state  and firm still report have difficulti find both skill and unskil worker  it is no surpris  as everyon has said  that residenti construct in our region continu to declin and remain weak   the valu of contract for residenti build has fallen more than    percent in the region dure the first five month of this year compar with last year at this  e   but that  we have to rememb  was near the peak   real estat agent and homebuild general report slow of sale in may   while the number of exist home for sale on the market has increas  averag sell price have not chang much   i would character the nonresidenti real estat market in the region as fair firm  although construct is not as strong as last year   offic vacanc rate continu to fall  and in center citi philadelphia  they drop to    percent   they were about    percent just around eighteen month ago   real estat firm report that overal demand for industri space continu to be robust and that vacanc rate for this type of space are near record low in some market   rental rate continu to rise  particular for warehous space  and rent are at a record high in those area   i take these report as indic of continu expans in econom activ go forward  interest enough regard build  i had two observ from ceo   one is ceo of a build suppli compani that manufactur throughout the unit state and has sale of almost     billion   he said that  remark  even with what is go on with homebuild  his sale are hold up veri  veri strong and they are do veri  veri well this year   anoth ceo  whose compani produc product most for residenti cabinetri and other type of thing  one of the largest in the countri  say that  while new home sale for his work are way down  they have larg been offset by remodel activ   peopl have substitut remodel for buy a new home  as long as i   m report anecdot here  i will pass on one other anecdot  for what it is worth  about truck   i listen to presid   and presid pool talk about volum in truck   just as an observ  an execut who run a truck compani throughout the countri told me that one thing that has happen in truck is that  rather than ship boom box  they are ship ipod    laughter   that is true of a lot of consum good   instead of ship larg crt screen  they now ship flat panel display  so even while the volum of good is be reduc  gasolin price are high  and they are lay off trucker and downsiz the volum  the valu of what they are ship has been maintain pretti well   so he was note a dynam of valu versus volum here  which i thought was veri interest  on the inflat front in the district  price for industri good continu to increas  but retail price increas have not been widespread   howev  mani of our busi contact continu to express concern over rise energi cost and food price and the effect on their busi and the consum   i interpret this to mean that they continu to be puzzl by our focus on core inflat when they see that overal inflat is what affect the consum and their busi  and they seem to doubt core inflat   s valu as a polici object or a measur of under inflat   they may be wrong in that  but it tell me that  if they continu to be confus by how we view core inflat and what we use it for  we might need to improv our communic to the public about how we think about it and whi we focus on it  on the nation level  i have becom more comfort with the econom situat as the year has progress   at our meet in may  we were begin to see some posit sign regard both real econom activ and inflat   durabl good order were up  allay some concern about the first quarter   s weak in busi invest   improv ism number were signal that the slowdown in manufactur might be end  and although hous market remain weak  there were limit sign of ani signific spillov to other sector   labor market remain firm   at that  e there were sign that core inflat might be moder   as a consequ  i express hope that in the come month those data would be reinforc  fortun  from my perspect  those hope have been larg realiz   come into this meet  we have receiv more posit news on the economi  and i have becom somewhat more confid that the economi is on track to return to near trend growth later this year as the effect of the hous correct moder  albeit veri slowli   inde  data receiv to date suggest that we will see a substanti rebound in real gdp growth this quarter  as the  book has note   after sever month of stagnat  manufactur activ seem to have pick up  and busi fix invest is moder strengthen  labor market remain firm  and yet in recent quarter we have note a seem disconnect between strong labor market and weaker gdp growth   howev  we now may be get some hint that this puzzl is more appar than real  and i want to reinforc the point that presid   made earlier in that i think two factor suggest this   first  from decemb to may the household survey show almost no employ growth whatsoev  wherea the establish survey show     percent annual growth dure that period   second   and again as presid   note   the busi employ dynam report came out  it was onli for the third quarter of last year  but it show about         fewer job creat in the third quarter than we thought   what is import about that report is that it arguabl   a better job of track the birth and death of firm in the data  and so there is some reason to believ that  while this is suggest  the payrol employ that we have been see may not be as strong as perhap we thought  and that may make some of this puzzl less of a concern   moreov  as presid   point out  it is also relev for the longer term becaus  if employ wasn   t as strong as we thought  product is go to end up be higher than we thought  and it will help resolv some of that slowdown in product   so i think there are various hint that that may be the direct that we are head  in my own forecast  i see slight more under strength and so a somewhat fa  return to trend growth than the  book     the current stanc of monetari polici is maintain   i see strength in person incom  a strong balanc sheet  as we saw earlier today   strong equiti market  and a resili alreadi shown by consum despit the lower home equiti valu and higher gasolin price  suggest that there is probabl slight more momentum in consum spend than suggest in the  book   i am modest more op ist about the labor market than the  book   modest  as i anticip less of a downturn in labor forc particip rate than is built into that forecast  the rise in long term interest rate reflect the market   s upgrad of it assess of the economi   s strength go forward   inde  as has been note a coupl of  e  that uptick in long term interest rate has been  i won   t say a worldwid phenomenon  but certain wide spread in mani countri around the world  which may be say that global growth is more stabl  predict  and posit than perhap we thought  now  this is not to say that i do not see risk around this growth forecast   of cours  as everyon els    i see hous as the biggest downsid risk that we face   there is still consider uncertainti out there  and i do not want to underes  the risk   hous inventori remain high  and i do not see ani strong evid of pickup in demand   despit the problem in subprim lend market  howev  i think the financi sector remain healthi   healthier now than it was perhap in the earli      s with the previous hous boom   i am more comfort with the notion that there will be no spillov into other part of the economi  and thus i have becom more comfort with forecast of return to trend growth in the second half of this year and into        on the inflat front  higher energi price have led to an acceler of headlin inflat  but there has been some improv in core inflat measur in recent month  the three month growth rate in the core cpi and the core pce have been deceler sinc februari   although these develop in inflat are encourag  i remain cautious about extrapol too much from recent data   dure this cycl we have seen period of deceler revers a coupl of month later   inde  the  book expect that much of the favor read on core pce inflat will prove transitori   so i remain concern that our core inflat rate may not continu their recent drift down   i would also caution that headlin inflat  as i note earlier  has remain stubborn high   thus  in approach my forecast  i have assum that the appropri polici path was one that would return the economi to steadi state growth and to my inflat target by the end of the forecast period  given my outlook on the under strength of the economi and an inflat goal of     percent for the pce  it should not be surpris that my forecast incorpor a slight tighter polici path than the  book     in particular  in my forecast the feder fund rate rise    basi point  to      percent  by earli         as progress is made on bring down inflat start in the second half of        the fed fund rate move down  end at about   percent by the end of        this polici path reflect my view that  unless we take further action by addit firm or an announc or both that commit us to an inflat goal that is lower than the market current expect  which seem to be about     percent  i believ it will be difficult to sustain an inflat rate that is in keep with my view of price stabil   i believ this can be accomplish with relat littl effect on real growth in        my assumpt in the model with which i   m work is that  onc we begin to rais rate  the market will quick recogn our commit to lower inflat and expect will move down accord  mitig the real output effect of this modest tighten   the movement down in expect could be expedit by the committe   s explicit announc the target   this view of expect format is more heavili weight to forward look element than to distribut lag element of past inflat   by the way  i want to applaud the staff for their work on inflat dynam   i thought it was an excel piec of work   i found the discuss veri help and a step in the right direct  both conceptu and empir  in ani event  the bottom line for my forecast is that i anticip that the economi will grow just below trend of   percent in      and at trend of   percent in       and we achiev an inflat goal of     percent by the end of the period   of cours  this forecast is base on my desir inflat object  which may not be repres of other member of the committe   if there were a common object that differ from my own view  then my presum appropri polici path might be differ   given this observ and the lack of an agre upon goal  i think we need to be concern about how the public will interpret these forecast  but i will save my thought on that for the next go round
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the outlook look a littl better  i think   the unit state look okay  and the world look veri strong  hous here seem as though it will get wors befor it get better  but the rest of the economi seem to be do reason well   with output and invest spend perhap a bit firmer than we thought they would be and employ growth and incom growth look reason good  we have not signific chang our central project   we still see an economi grow around   percent over the forecast period  about our es  of potenti  with core pce inflat fall just below     this assum a path for the nomin fed fund rate that is flat for sever more quarter  essenti the same as in the  book and in the market now   the risk to this outlook  though  have chang   we see less downsid risk to growth but still believ the risk to our growth forecast are weight toward the weaker outcom  although the recent inflat number have been good  they probabl exagger the moder of under inflat  and we see  therefor  continu upsid risk to our inflat forecast   i still think this latter risk should remain our more consequenti concern  relat to the  book  we have a bit more growth becaus of our higher es  of growth in the labor forc and a bit less inflat  but these differ are small  smaller than they have been  and they do not have signific implic for our view on monetari polici   the market    percept of fundament have in some respect move in our direct in the past few week   i say    in some respect    becaus we need to be attent to the rise in impli inflat that you see in tip   our view and the market    view of the expans  the risk to the outlook  and implic for monetari polici have converg  this mean that the effect stanc of monetari polici is a littl tighter than it was  a few import issu go forward   on the growth front  i still think that the probabl of weak exceed that of strength   there is still a signific risk that we will see a more substanti adjust of hous price  perhap drawn out over a sustain period of  e with greater advers effect on confid and spend   of cours  if employ and incom growth stay reason strong  the effect of that potenti scenario should be manag   if not  we will have more to worri about   i note that some major financi institut are now start to report sign of rise delinqu in consum credit product outsid mortgag such as automobil loan and leas   this is the first  e that i have heard that report in a signific sens  and mayb it is a sign of some vulner ahead   the strength of demand growth outsid the unit state has been help  and we agre with the  book that it look like to continu for some  e   but thing could be kind of bumpi out there  particular in place like china  and monetari polici in much of the world is onli now start to move short term real rate higher into posit territori  on the inflat front  it seem earli to declar satisfact or victori  not particular becaus of the recent reacceler in headlin inflat but just becaus of the role of transitori factor in the recent moder in core and the rise in breakeven in tip  we cannot be fulli confid yet that a constant nomin fed fund rate at current level will deliv an accept inflat forecast   we do not  in my view  need to tri to induc right now a further tighten of financi condit to push core inflat down further and fa    but we need more  e befor we can justifi shift to a more balanc risk assess of inflat or someth equival  someth that would have the effect  for exampl  of indic satisfact with current level or of suggest that the risk are balanc around the path of inflat that we see in our central tendenc project  with financi market  we are at a delic moment   the loss in subprim are still work their way through the system   rate agenc are like to downgrad a larger share of past issu  more than they have alreadi   the mark that peopl show indic that both hedg fund and dealer in a lot of this stuff may still have a way to go to catch up with the movement in market price   this dynam itself could induc a further reduct in willing to financ new mortgag   you could see pocket of loss in the system  liquid pressur in hedg fund and their counterparti  and further forc liquid  it is possibl that we will still have a bunch of that effect ahead of us  even if no big negat shock to demand occur and induc a broader distress in consum credit   we could also see it spread to commerci real estat   we could see a broader pullback from cdos and clos as well  either from a general eros of faith in the rate model   as bill said  it is a possibl   or from just concern about liquid in those instrument   we could see a sharp  substanti widen of credit spread provok by an unanticip default or two or just a general reassess of risk at current price   a veri larg amount of lbo financ that is yet to be close  distribut  and place is still work it way through the system  as in the past  we could see a deal or two get hung  the music stop  and that forc some broader repric   peopl get stuck with stuff they don   t want to hold or did not expect to hold   i think we now see more sensit in market about the prospect of a diminish appetit among the world   s saver and central bank to increas their exposur to the unit state  or at least we see more sensit to the percept out there that the dynam might be unfold   you can see a bit of all this in some spread  in some report of resist to further eros in coven  in some reduc appetit for new bridg book exposur to leverag lend   you can see it in some chang in margin term in some instrument vis  vis some counterparti   for now i think it is a relat healthi  still pretti modest  and quit contain shift toward a more cautious assess of risk  but these thing general don   t tend to unfold gradual   on balanc  though  i think we are in a pretti good place in term of polici  in term of the market   s expect about polici now  and in term of how we have been frame the balanc of risk to the outlook
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   my project was close in line with that of the  book  modest below trend growth for a few quarter  held down by a prolong weak in hous   as that drag abat  the economi pick up to potenti and is held back from overshoot that potenti by various factor  includ the rise in the save rate and slight lower growth of govern spend  under these circumst  core pce inflat hold in the neighborhood of   percent   i do not realli see much to push it one way or anoth at this point   the economi is produc veri near it potenti  as close as we can figur   inflat expect have been move in a narrow rang   some of the transitori factor  such as owner    equival rent  that we   re expect to come down to reduc inflat have alreadi done that to a consider extent   so i don   t see them  move forward  as have a big effect   given the limit pass through of energi and commod price into core price  i would not expect much downward pressur on inflat from a level out of those price  i think that we are around   percent and that we will probabl stay there  at least for a littl while  in term of risk  the recent data on capit good  order and shipment  and manufactur activ suggest  as mani have remark  some reduc downsid risk from busi attitud on spend   they do not suggest a great deal of strength in busi capit spend  howev   the fundament are less favor than they were a coupl of year ago  and the most recent data  which we receiv today  suggest a pretti flat or a modest upward tilt to capit spend in the second quarter   the data weren   t that strong  but they do suggest that what i fear in may   that we were in the midst of a cyclic adjust that was go to make capit spend much weaker   has certain abat  i agre with mani other around the tabl that hous is a signific downsid risk to the forecast  given the high level of inventori despit a major reduct in start over the past year and the price to rent ratio be as high as it is   the further slide in hous may be gentl  as presid   said  but i do not think we   ve seen the bottom yet   you can go a long way at a gentl slope    laughter   we also have not yet realli seen the full effect of the tighten in subprim credit term or  obvious  of the recent increas in mortgag rate  i also see a big downsid risk from consumpt   the  book has the growth of consumpt sustain despit an increas in save rate as the growth in dispos incom exceed the growth in gdp   and that is with the labor share recov and the busi profit share declin   i see two downsid risk to that   one is that the save rate will rise fa  as the hous weak feed through both in term of wealth effect and in term of reduc avail of credit as term tighten and there is less equiti to borrow against  particular for liquid constrain household   i also continu to see a downsid risk to equiti price  although i have certain been wrong so far   nelli   s tabl present the differ between the staff   s forecast of profit and the market   s forecast of profit show a huge differ for next year   so though i think the basic outlook is fine  i still see some downsid risk on that side  on the inflat front  i  like other  see the better than expect core inflat as a hope sign  but it is recent and may be affect by temporari factor  and i do not think we need to get too enthusiast about it   i do see sever upsid risk to inflat   the high level of total headlin inflat  which could erod inflat expect  busi resist to ani eros of profit margin as unit labor cost pick up  the high level of resourc util in the unit state  and the tighter global condit of demand on potenti suppli that other of you have mention  let me say a word or two about my year three project   i project output growth at     percent  the unemploy rate at    percent  and core pce inflat at     percent   i certain saw my output and employ project as a sens of what the steadi state was   on the unemploy rate  i do think the odd are better that the nairu is lower than that it is higher than the staff   s   percent assumpt   this judgment is part base on the veri moder pickup in the employ cost index  and averag hour earn growth has actual been come off recent   on the behavior of core inflat  i don   t see much evid that we are signific beyond potenti now  although i recogn that  with a veri flat phillip curv  it could be a long  e befor one figur that out   but i had growth of potenti at     percent  which is below what i infer to be the central tendenc of the committe  regard my read of the declin in product growth  product over the past five quarter has been grow signific below the staff   s es  of     percent  some of it is cyclic   there could be a revis  as presid   and   have suggest   i confess to have ask     about this at the break  and he said that the data are kind of ambigu here and that it is much too earli to predict a signific downward revis to employ   but i hope you are right   now  some of the recent slowdown certain must be cyclic  though i would have thought that labor hoard and thing like that would be much less in today   s flexibl labor market  with so much more use of temporari worker than there has been in the past   i would think that the cyclic effect on product would be mute  that busi would move pretti prompt to adjust their labor forc to output   so i wonder how much cyclic there is   the big uncertainti is in the construct industri and in the fact that construct employ hasn   t come down  we don   t quit understand whi it hasn   t come down more   so perhap product will pick up  but i still would look at the staff   s     percent as have even just a littl more downsid than upsid risk to it  given the fact that we have had more like   to     percent in the past four or five quarter   so i stuck with the staff   s forecast of     percent potenti gdp  in some sens  our view of what the potenti growth rate is isn   t all that import for monetari polici   we ought to be look at the gap   we ought to be look at the pressur of the level of product on the level of potenti gdp   but i don   t think it   s quit that easi   we don   t know what that gap is   we have seen that the surpris over the past year or two have been in the behavior of the unemploy rate and capac util relat to growth   so we do tend to look at our es  of potenti growth and the actual come in relat to those es  and pass judgment on what   s happen to the output gap even when the unemploy rate  sn   t move   we just need to rememb that potenti growth is an entir es  number that we will never observ  and we need to be awar that it might not be quit as high as the central tendenc indic that my colleagu on the committe appar think it is   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   regard overal econom growth  my own macroeconom view are not inconsist with the central tendenc of the project that were pull togeth for this meet   i think the staff and the particip around the tabl deserv signific credit for be stubborn about the moder growth hypothesi while market have been on all side of it   the market appear readi to look through the second quarter gdp growth number  which appear to be a bit abov trend   i   d say  that we have gotten some credit from the market for be stubborn and stubborn right on our econom forecast  but they certain haven   t given us their proxi  and i would not expect them to do so   they happen to share our view for now is what i would say  and i wouldn   t expect that situat to remain over the forecast period   again  neither should our intent be to somehow get these curv to match over the come sever quarter  on the inflat pictur  though it has improv a bit   and i am tri not to disregard veri good news   i must say that it strike me as thorough unconvinc   to me  inflat  in our old statement languag  remain the predomin risk   i am less certain that core will continu the recent trend   i do believ that headlin inflat may be tell us someth in term of secular trend around energi and food that we can   t dismiss  and the warn from some of the other signal that we would see as rough proxi for inflat are still veri real  regard what the financi condit are tell us about growth  it strike me that  from all the data we have receiv between our last meet and this  financi condit might be as differ as ani other set of data that we receiv   my view is that financi condit are still support of growth  but somewhat less so   it is hard to determin at this point how much  but let me take a stab at do just that   sinc we last met  as bill said at the outset  we wit ten year treasuri yield increas on the order of between    and    basi point   i am not uncomfort with that increment tighten of polici in the financi market  but we have to be care of what we wish for   i think the explan from our staff here in washington and bill and the staff in new york is right  which is that market have not come to a rosier view of the futur   all they have realli done is to take out the downsid risk that came out of the first quarter   as the data came in a bit abov expect  that insur bet that they had   that we were wrong and would have to cut rate   realli lost credibl   i think their central view of the economi now is not one that roar back but one that is quit consist with the moder growth stori   the financi market have inde tighten polici somewhat   even sinc the  e that the bluebook was produc last week  spread have appar widen in addit to the risk free rate be somewhat higher   but this is all happen in veri real  e  and my report a week ago would have sound quit a bit differ from the one today  we have wit increas term premium and greater volatil across mani  if not all  financi market   both the move index for treasuri and the vix for equiti are high relat to the averag of the past year but are still fair reason over a somewhat broader period   say  the last five year   term premium i would character as return to more normal level   but  again  not out of line with histori  we have seen in the bluebook that credit default swap  cds  spread and other spread had widen  but that yet hadn   t happen in the high yield market  where appar there was some narrow of spread   that has chang rather dramat in the past four or five trade day   i   m sure vinc will share more inform on this tomorrow   but the cds spread realli occur first  then there was a lag to high yield spread   in the past two week  invest grade cds spread have widen about   basi point  high yield cds spread have widen about     a relat new index of loan cds spread has widen about    basi point  and most  if not all  structur product  even asset wholli unrel to the hous market  have been undergo some spread widen   as i mention  high yield spread appear to be catch up to cds spread  and with the incred flow of deal in the market  i would guess that the trend continu  we   re see higher financ cost and slight tougher term for lbos  the latter is a remark new develop   m a price  probabl for the first  e sinc i have been sit at this tabl  appear in the market to be come off their level   so when auction for properti of public trade compani are occur  the price between initi indic of interest and final bid for the first  e may actual be come down  whi is that   interest coverag ratio cannot go much below where they have been in this cycl   it is     or      e  but again  as the risk free rate has gone up  as spread have widen  you can buy just a littl less debt for that   as a result  equiti player that do not want to compromis their equiti return can pay a littl less for these properti  whether this phenomenon is veri short term  like the phenomena we heard about after the tumult in late februari and we return to in the headi day of the capit market  i do not know   this may just be a temporari prefer shift toward qualiti and toward higher volatil and a return to the    glori    day  but i tend to think not   it is a tough call  and i reserv the right to chang my judgment  i think that the new suppli that   s come into the market  most of which need to get price befor the market slow down in august  will test the market    resili  will test price  and will test term   up to this point we have seen veri littl reduct in liquid  but we are see a few deal be pull from the market   price power appear to be come back to investor  and negoti around price and term seem signific more balanc than they have been in a veri long  e   some of the instrument that we have sort of giggl about around this tabl   the pay in kind note with option cash payment   seem to have lost some traction in the market in the past week   i do not know whether they will return  but i take this new disciplin in the market as an encourag sign   so what is go to be the result effect on price  term  and condit   that is someth we will have to judg  but financi condit  as i said at the outset  are perhap somewhat more restrict than they were  but they should still be quit support of growth  at the outset i talk about the risk on the inflat front   let me build on a coupl of remark that vice chairman   made about risk now in the financi market   if the problem that we have seen around structur product that have come out of the bear stearn scenario are realli about the subprim market and subprim collater and hous  there   s not much to worri about   but to the extent that the stori is realli about structur product   product that have not been signific stress test   then there is a risk that the financi market may react and overreact   that scenario will bring up reput risk issu   even financi intermediari that are in the agenc busi are relearn the lesson that agenc busi is not free   that there are  in fact  dissynergi from be in the princip invest busi and the agenc busi under one market name   we are learn a lot about what the market believ about the transpar of price  particular in  e of financi distress   of cours  in  e of distress  the correl among all these asset do not look as they do in model  and that is someth that will play itself out   i think that   right referenc the role of gatekeep in the credit agenc  who i suspect are go to have a fair rude awaken over the next six to nine month   as i also said  regard this financi innov  which on net is of great benefit to us  we will realli see some of the product test   along with the product  moreov  the market particip    behavior will be test  perhap in this upcom period  as never befor   so the financi market are a friend on this  but there is greater risk than there was when we last met   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   the last  e we met  there seem to be a bit of increas uncertainti about a potenti downdraft on econom growth  and now some of that concern about that downturn seem to be no longer there   some intermeet data have come in a littl more on the upsid  and obvious the market have chang their expect and seem to agre with that   i think the strength in the labor market and in consumpt  although face some challeng  is still at a reason level   it   seem that we are get some sign that invest is come back  recent durabl good number  which came out today  perhap rais some question of that   we have had a coupl of good month and now a bit more of a challeng   but when you smooth through  i think  exact as governor kohn suggest  that we   ll have moder growth go forward  a forecast that i think is consist with the  book forecast   strength in nonresidenti construct  as we have heard around the tabl  has also provid us with a bit more op  for invest in general   but invest is obvious close tie to where product is go becaus  if we don   t have invest  particular in the high tech area rather than just in the construct sector  it is go to be hard to sustain high product growth   when we get the revis number on juli    and we also get advanc gdp  we   re go to get a lot of inform about that  and i think there is still a lot of uncertainti as to exact where product is go   so i will defer my comment until the next meet becaus we will have those number by then  regard consumpt  we have been have the offset wealth effect of the recent robust equiti asset market and much less robust hous asset market  continu strength in the labor market  and as the  book point out  increas dispos incom becaus we   re have incom grow fa  than product growth  at least right now  that suggest that we might maintain a reason support for consumpt growth  but again  as governor kohn said  there are potenti some challeng here  but now i want to discuss the big challeng that everyon keep talk about  which is the hous market   it has becom obvious that the transit is go to be quit a long one and potenti a pain one  perhap more in individu pocket and for individu famili than for the macroeconomi   it will not just disappear after the third quarter of the year or even the fourth quarter of the year   i would think in four differ way about how hous can have a broader effect on the economi  first is obvious the direct effect on price   the case shiller ten citi index suggest that the price will fall about   percent over the next year   now  that   s rough where the market was just befor the issu in subprim aros at the end of februari  and it is actual better than it was last fall   so the market don   t think that there will be an enorm challeng with respect to price  at least in these ten market   but as presid pool mention  some  the price even in these improv index  like the case shiller index  may lag what   s go on and may not accur reflect the under actual valu that peopl can realiz   so there still may be more challeng even though the index suggest that hous price are down onli   percent   it is also interest to look at the delta  the chang in the index   we haven   t realli seen much from that  which i think is hearten  but it is still someth that we have to watch out for  second are the indirect effect  the wealth effect   as i mention  there have been offset wealth effect from the equiti market and the hous market   more broad  there can be confid effect on spend and on save behavior   so far we haven   t seen a lot of evid of that   as vice chairman   mention  there have been anecdot report of challeng in other area of consum credit  although so far no real systemat data suggest that   even if there is a littl movement up  in almost all the typic index we use  mani of which were mention in the brief  we are at low or are much lower than usual histor   so even with the small movement up  there are not necessarili enorm challeng  but these effect also have to be watch  a third veri import potenti effect of this long transit is a respons by us or by lawmak that could make the transit even longer and more difficult   as a number of you know   and all of you have been face pressur on some of these thing   we will be put out the subprim adjust rate mortgag guidanc that we put out for comment just at the end of februari   our  e couldn   t have been better for get that out   we did it just as the problem were becom more of an issu public   i hope the guidanc will be out by the end of this week   we are propos guidanc that subprim adjust rate mortgag have underwrit at the fulli index rate   i do not think that   s go to be much of a shock to the market   the market have larg move there alreadi   this was true from some earli statement by freddi mac and fanni mae   also  some of the major player who were not underwrit at the fulli index rate are simpli not there anymor   they are bankrupt   and some of the other player who were not do it have chang their standard   as we know from the survey of senior loan offic  standard have been rise  that is not to say that it won   t have some effect  but relat to where the market has alreadi move  the effect is not go to be signific  the other major guidanc is for give a prepay penalti grace period of sixti day so that peopl will have at least sixti day befor the reset to refin their mortgag  it   s unclear from the studi we have done at the board and from look around how much of an effect that will have on the initi rate or the so call teaser rate   it seem that chang their abil to do that from zero to thirti to sixti day is unlik to have an enorm effect on the teaser rate  but that is someth that is uncertain   there are some state that alreadi outlaw prepay penalti or have restrict on them   there is not a lot of evid suggest that it is more difficult to get financ in those state   again  these guidelin are untest  but i don   t think they will have an enorm effect on the market  but they are obvious someth to watch  as you well know  we have put out an interag letter suggest that servic and lender work veri close with distress borrow to tri to work thing out and keep peopl in their home   do so is in the interest of the peopl in the home  it is virtual alway in the fiduciari interest of the loan servic and of the lender   i think we have been make progress on account issu that have been make it difficult for some servic to do this  and we are work veri close with the sec and with fasb on some of these thing   we may be make progress in give comfort to the servic who want to do some restructur that would help keep peopl in their hous and would ul  be better for the individu and for the owner of the secur   we have also had the hoepa hear here in which we talk about the potenti for rule write in sever area  such as requir escrow for tax and insur  some regul or restrict of prepay penalti  and various other thing   that would be down the line  but again  we are think that this is unlik to have a major effect relat to where the market have alreadi move  fourth and final  there has been a lot of interest in the effect of subprim in the hous market not onli on the mortgag market but also more general on the financi market  as governor   and vice chairman   point out   fortun it seem that liquid is larg be maintain in the mortgag origin market   there are still fair robust amount of subprim and alt a origin occur   they obvious are go to be declin over  e becaus there are fewer be made  but they were at an unusu high level in       and so it   s a natur part of the transit process that they would go down   there has been a veri signific increas in spread  as has been mention by the previous speaker  and there   s much more tier of risk   it is not just that the bs are all the same  it is where they origin   the market are look through the packag to see what   s in them  which is veri  veri valuabl   increas volatil and higher price in these market and the higher long term interest rate will be a bit more of a challeng for peopl do refinanc  although we   re now down to about      for the ten year  off    to    basi point from the high of the other week  and so it may not be quit as much of a challeng   but there is also a legal risk in this market becaus  if some problem becom larger  there could be concern about what the new instrument realli mean and what you have actual purchas   if legal risk is there  the market will start to run away from these thing   then you may have some sever liquid problem   i do not think that we see those challeng yet  but it is one indirect effect on the financi market of some of these issu  just quick on inflat   most peopl have said that we   ve seen some moder  it is a littl too soon to declar victori   as we said in the initi brief  when we drill down into the compon and look at owner    equival rent  we may get some nasti surpris go forward   some number have gone down  but owner    equival rent may come back up a bit   so i don   t think we can say that the temporari elev in that area has pass and that we can move on   i think some challeng are still there   fortun  expect still seem reason well contain   but i think that there may be some challeng go forward as the economi continu to grow at least at a moder pace  and some of the temporari factor are not necessarili complet behind us   we still have to look for potenti price pressur go forward   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you   my view of what has been happen in the economi is that we have been basic go through a rebalanc   we had a sector that was clear bubbl like with excess spend  and now we are get the retrench  which is take a bit longer than we expect   but the good news is that we are go through a rebalanc in which we are just move resourc to other sector and that is actual go much along the line that we want to see   the problem in a rebalanc episod is that you are alway worri about the risk that is possibl becaus these transit don   t alway occur smooth   i think that we were much more worri about that   at least i was more worri   at the previous meet   but we have been see that the rebalanc is actual go along pretti well   in particular  although the hous market is veri weak  veri much along the line of the  book forecast  it hasn   t surpris us this particular period   it   s just that it is pretti bad   but the risk are actual fair balanc on hous becaus we do not see it as veri strong and that is part of the process of undo the previous excess  anoth veri import thing is that we have not seen ani surpris spillov from the hous market   as  e goe on and noth realli bad happen  we becom more confid that  in fact  the downsid risk isn   t there either   we have also seen that the invest sector has been look a littl stronger   again  that realli did concern me at the last fomc meet   yet we have had some reason number  they are not spectacular  but i think the downsid risk have dissip  so the bottom line is that i see the economi as rebalanc and do it in a fair good way   in fact  from a long run perspect  this is a good thing and not a bad thing  the downsid risk has dissip  and the risk are now quit balanc   so i am quit comfort with the  book forecast on this  which is that we have growth somewhat below trend but move back toward trend  and i see that there has been a shift in a posit direct and the risk are not excess on the downsid but are much more balanc  when i look at the inflat pictur  i am in a way pleas with the recent number becaus there is no strong indic that we are far from potenti output and  in particular  there is a littl indic that the tight in the economi certain will be unravel  accord to our forecast  not much is go on in that area  so what   s go on in inflat expect will be domin   i mean  given that inflat expect have been pretti well anchor around   percent  although there is some uncertainti  i thought that we would have a return to   percent number a bit more quick than the origin  book forecast show   i was realli pleas becaus the  book has basic move closer to the pictur that i had all along  so now i   m veri comfort with the  book forecast  in contrast to some other peopl  i think the risk are pretti balanc   now  mayb that is not realli differ becaus of the peopl who have inflat go below   percent  and i don   t see that   so i believ it   s go to be   now and it   s go to be   for a while unless we make a concert effort to chang inflat expect   then there is the whole issu of how we might go about do that   but given the current environ  my view is that risk are fair balanc   other peopl are say that there is risk on the upsid  but i think that   s becaus they just have slight lower number regard where they think inflat will be   but probabl when we look at it from that perspect  it is about the same   so right now i think the economi is evolv in a pretti reason way  and i   m sure we will be surpris in one direct or anoth in the futur   thank you veri much
thank you  and thank to everyon   let me tri to give a quick summari  and if i misrepres you  pleas let me know   particip    expect for growth were vari  but most peopl expect to see strengthen over the remaind of this year and into      and        the princip sourc of downsid risk is hous  which remain weak  perhap in part becaus of problem in mortgag market   howev  signific spillov have yet to emerg from the hous situat  and other compon of demand appear to be strengthen and therebi offset the drag from residenti construct   a number of particip refer to the strength of the global economi  which is s ul u s  export but also lead to increas in cost of energi and metal  invest has pick up from a bit of a pothol and is grow now at a moder pace with particular strength on the commerci real estat side   inventori are most align with sale and manufactur seem to be strengthen overal   consumpt seem like to grow at a steadi but not exuber level  with factor such as gasolin price and slower hous appreci creat some drag but strong employ and incom act as support   inde  the labor market continu to be strong  although there are some measur issu that were note  with unfil demand for high skill worker and with some sign of wage pressur   overal  the risk to output seem rough balanc around the path of a gradual increas in growth  particip did note the increas in long term interest rate  which tend to align market polici expect with those of the committe   higher long term interest rate and some other chang in financi market may be slight restrict but probabl not substanti so   some also note risk in financi market  includ the aforement risk associ with the subprim sector  but also more general concern about structur credit product and the possibl effect of a declin in liquid   howev  i would note also  as some other did  that a bit of cool in the financi market might not be an entir bad thing  recent core inflat number have been favor  and most of you see continu moder in inflat result from mild restrict polici  the end of some temporari influenc  and slower increas in shelter cost   howev  a few of you have suggest that some of the recent improv in core inflat is transitori  and they note upsid risk  includ resourc util  possibl pass through from energi and commod cost  slower product growth  and the possibl effect of high headlin inflat on inflat expect   high capac util   and    global     presid     is also a sourc of possibl inflat pressur
is presid   a sourc of inflat    laughter
onli rhetor inflat
all in all  there still seem to be general agreement that the risk to inflat remain to the upsid and remain the predomin concern   is that a reason summari   are there ani comment  let me present just a few essenti random thought at this point   first of all  from my perspect  the biggest puzzl about what   s happen is the behavior of the labor market  which is continu   we   ve had slow growth   unemploy is at least not fall anymor  but it remain stabl at a fair low level   my scenario for the soft land plus some moder of inflat involv some cool of the labor market from here   i still think it will happen  but admit  there is onli the slightest suggest so far that it is happen   in particular  we have not yet seen the declin of construct employ  which i have continu refer to and continu to expect   there have been a number of discuss about whi we haven   t seen that respons yet   some have note the possibl that a lot of the worker are undocu and  therefor  are not be count by the usual measur   howev  they seem to have been count when the market was expand   so it is a littl puzzl whi sudden they are not be count   thus i still think there will be some moder soften in the labor market over the next year   if that   not happen  then we will be at some risk of higher upsid growth than we anticip and higher inflat pressur than we anticip   so for me that is a central thing to look at   i think in talk about this  it is import to note how uncertain we are about what the natur rate of unemploy is and that entir concept   judg from the fomc   s      project  most of us think that the natur rate may be a bit below   percent  and i would note that the unemploy rate was in the mid to low  s for four year in the late     s and has been in that rang now for about two and one half year   so it is not entir evid where the natur rate is  and it   make some differ obvious   again  i expect to see some moder in the labor market  and i believ that is critic to our scenario  like everyon els  i think the hous situat continu to involv downsid risk   i would reiter what presid pool said   that this is an asset market  that therefor price chang are inher  at least to some extent  unpredict  that a lot is go to depend on confid  which is go to depend on result  which is go to depend on confid  and therefor  that we need to be veri care  just the same as with inflat  about declar victori too soon on the hous front   in particular  there is an interact between the mortgag market and financi market   there has been discuss of that alreadi today  but there is the potenti for some trigger to lead to what would amount to an effect tighten in financi market  which would affect not onli hous but also potenti  for exampl  corpor credit   although that remain just a risk  i think it   s one we need to keep in mind  i agre with the general view around the tabl that  except for hous  the economi look to be healthi   capit spend is not go gangbust  but it   seem to have come back to some modest trend   i also agre with what a number of peopl said about the strength of the world economi   we shouldn   t get too carri away with the export sector  what we   re hope for here is that net export will not be a net drag on growth    laughter  nevertheless  that is an improv over the past  and the strong world economi should on net be help to our economi  like everyon els  i   m encourag about the incom inflat data   i agre that some of these good number may be partial transitori   howev  when you analyz this  there has been a decid step down in the past three or four month in the shelter compon   i would make two observ   one is that  exclud shelter  core pce inflat is now at the lowest number sinc the end of       if the shelter number of the past three month were to persist  then that would automat arithmet give us some addit progress on inflat   now  that may not happen   clear we have month to month variat  as we have mention mani  e  but i think some slack could combin with some more moder in rent   on the inflat expect issu  i thought       s graph were veri instruct   i do veri much believ that inflat expect influenc actual inflat and that the anchor of inflat expect is veri import  but i don   t think they   re anchor at        i think that they   re anchor at a general rang somewher around   percent   what     s graph show was that the level of expect that we observ seem also to be consist with     or       so i don   t think that   s an absolut barrier  though i conced that expect play an import role   two  i would also just comment about the statist issu   i was among a number of peopl who talk about the statist signific of the chang in inflat that we have seen and note that these month to month chang are subject to a lot of variabl shock   but let me just say that i think it   s probabl worth note that  in the classic statist signific test and everyth we   re do here  we   re bayesian decisionmak  and we   re tri to make a decis base on our best es  of where we are at a given moment   even if we conclud that inflat   s declin is not statist signific in a classic sens  we still ought to act as if there has been some declin in inflat   as a thought experi  i would ask what we would be say now if we had gone up     percentag point from where we were in may   i think that would have led to a somewhat differ tone around the tabl   so while acknowledg the statist variabl and the transitori natur  i think that there has been some improv and that it is show through into our think about the economi  one last thought   a number of peopl have mention the distinct between core and total inflat   i agre that our communic on this issu realli need some work   i was just in chicago  and sever peopl  includ director and employe  ask me     don   t you guy drive   don   t you eat       laughter   clear  we understand whi we do this  but i think we need to improv our communic on that particular front   that   s a littl segu into what we   ll be talk about tomorrow   so if you will bear with me   i know it is six o   clock  but i   d like to ask   just to give us a brief introduct to the monetari polici discuss we   ll be have tomorrow   that will save us some  e tomorrow and give us a chanc to think overnight about the subject
thank you  mr  chairman   two person note to start   first  i am the last person between you and british food  which mean that i   m not sure whether it is in your interest for me to speak quick or slowli   laughter   second  this week mark the first anniversari of the committe   s last polici action   the quarter point firm that brought the feder fund rate to    percent   paper is the tradit    materi use by mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix     present  and my gift to you is the materi label    fomc brief on monetari polici altern      the intermeet period saw consider upward revis to investor    expect for the set of monetari polici   as the shift from the dot to the solid line show in the top left panel of the first exhibit  the path of the expect feder fund rate rotat up  post increas of    basi point at the end of this year and about    basi point by the end of next year   the start point for both the may   and the june    line  though  is the same   market particip continu to believ that you will keep the feder fund rate at    percent at this meet  judg by the desk   s survey of primari dealer  you are also expect to keep the word of the statement most intact   not much of this rise in market yield occur in narrow window surround the releas of econom data and speech by monetari polici maker   rather  the econom data  which ran somewhat stronger than anticip  and feder reserv communic  with the steadi repetit of the assess that upsid risk to inflat remain  seem to induc a rethink of the economi   s prospect and the attend need for monetari polici support   this rethink is most evid in the middl left panel  which show that the latest primari dealer forecast of the feder fund rate at year end  the blue bar  have shift notabl compar with the survey forecast just befor the may meet  the dash line    the revis to investor    view was associ with the increas of    to    basi point in the nomin treasuri yield plot in the right panel  and seen as the shift from the top dot black line to the solid black line    the price out of near term polici eas probabl explain the now shallow portion at the front part of the yield curv   the rise in nomin yield can most be attribut to an increas in real yield of    to    basi point  shown in the lower portion of the same panel   our term structur model suggest that virtual all the rise in real yield is due to fatter compens for bear risk   becaus the shift in the two set of yield curv did not match  the spread between the nomin and the index yield  which measur inflat compens  widen somewhat at longer matur   here  too  the model suggest that some of that larger gap reflect a higher risk premium   this  e for bear inflat risk   leav their es  of inflat expect onli modest higher   in recent day  concern about risk take  brought into the spotlight by the problem of two hedg fund manag by bear stearn  revers some of the upward tug of yield impart by the revis to the outlook for the economi and polici   as can be seen in the bottom left panel  the cost of credit protect for subprim mortgag pool packag over the past     year has risen over the past few week as the fear of a fire sale of the collater seiz by lender to the bear stearn fund depress price and rais concern about a more general spillov to other entiti and market   these fear also seem to have set off flight to safeti flow that pull treasuri yield lower in recent day   as note in the tabl at the bottom right  the ten year treasuri yield had risen about    basi point from the may meet to when we put the bluebook to bed  the first column    the outbreak of skittish in recent day trim sever basi point off that run up  the second column  and put equiti price into the red   i wonder if the recent of these event  which unfold after much of the staff brief work was wrap up and your own intervent were most written  mean that they have not been complet incorpor into your outlook   if so  this nervous in financi market probabl add to the list of reason for keep a low profil in your polici action at this meet by ratifi prevail expect   that is  to choos the unchang polici stanc of altern b in the bluebook   some of the other reason are the subject of exhibit     in the staff forecast  summar in the top left panel  output growth run a bit below that of it potenti in the near term  and inflat settl in at   percent   if you find that both a plausibl and an accept outcom  you might also align yourself with the polici assumpt of an unchang feder fund rate upon which that forecast is base   moreov  you were satisfi with keep the fund rate at    percent at your may meet   if you have filter the incom econom inform in a manner similar to the staff   seen in the  book as a slight upward revis to the growth of real gdp and a slight downward revis to core pce inflat   you probabl also believ that circumst have not chang enough to warrant a recalibr of polici   it is true that financi market restraint has ratchet up somewhat as investor    forecast of the feder fund rate path has risen   proxi in the top right panel by the year end expect feder fund rate in futur market   but the staff expect this to happen over the next year or so  which has been a sen ent share by some of you at the past few meet   the adjust in financi market over the intermeet period now bring market price into better align with the  book assumpt   shown by the black dot   and that this adjust took place on a more compress schedul than expect should probabl not make for a materi chang to the outlook   as seen in the middl panel  the current real feder fund rate  at    percent  match the  book consist es  of it equilibrium level   that is  if maintain  the current real rate would be consist with the output gap close within three year  at least in the  book outlook   an unchang nomin fund rate at this meet is also consist with mani polici rule  includ an es  one that captur your practic over the past twenti year and that is plot as the solid line in the bottom left panel   of cours  if you take into account forecast uncertainti  as is done by the light and dark   region  you can pitch a pretti larg tent with such polici rule   there is less doubt about the cours of monetari polici in financi market   as shown by the red bar at the bottom right  option on eurodollar futur impli a distribut for the feder fund rate six month from now that is tight clu  around the current set   here might be anoth reason for keep the fed fund rate unchang today   for all this year you have been hint that prevail market expect for the fed fund rate were too low   now that market particip have adjust in your desir direct  you might not want to surpris them   mani of you note that problem with the version of tabl   that circul in the bluebook  a subject discuss in exhibit     in the may statement  inflat was character as    somewhat elev     as in row   of the left column   but favor data sinc then have put the twelv month chang in core pce inflat at   percent  a level that some of you might find toler   as yet the committe has not spoken with one voic on the subject   we drop that contenti phrase in the bluebook and soften the balanc of risk languag as well   as a result  the releas of the word in the bluebook version of altern b would like trigger a declin in money market yield   the new version of altern b in the right column turn the heat back up somewhat by insert in row   word to the effect that the committe is not convinc that the present step down in inflat will persist   this draft also make clear in row   that the character of recent econom growth is base on the first half of this year and return the languag in row   to that use in the may statement   even if you are will to keep the fund rate at    percent for now  you might forese polici action some  soon  in which case the chang to the statement probabl do not repres your view   in particular  as shown in the top left panel of exhibit    the unemploy rate  the red line  has bounc around     percent for almost a year   if you believ that this repres a taut labor market  you may be concern about inflat pressur  particular given that the manufactur sector seem to have gone into a higher gear  as shown by recent read on the ism   s new order index  the black line   you might not be alon in be concern about inflat prospect   as plot in the middl left panel  five year  five year forward inflat compens has risen    basi point from it recent low   it might be nois  it might be a wider risk premium  or it might be increas inflat expect   if it is the last  you may want to posit yourself now for polici firm some  soon on the theori that an earli demonstr of your displeasur with a rise in inflat expect will effectu a less cost declin   some suggest for do so were offer in altern c in the bluebook  a few highlight of which are given in the bottom left panel   in particular  the altern c draft revers the order of the descript of econom activ in row   to downplay the qualif    despit the ongo adjust in the hous sector      more import  it retain the judgment that    core inflat remain somewhat elev    and give more reason that inflat mani come under pressur   if you have a frame of mind favor to finer shade of mean  you can alway tri dial down the modifi of elev inflat from    somewhat    to    slight      more substanti chang might be requir if you are inclin toward altern a  argument for which are shown in the right hand column   regardless of the reason behind the run up in market yield  household borrow to buy a hous now face higher mortgag rate  as shown in the top panel    this may both dissuad potenti new purchas of home and disappoint those household that were hope to refin on more favor term as the lock in period on their extant arm end   both will act as a drag on spend and perhap more substanti so than in the staff forecast   month    suppli of new home  plot in the middl right panel  has edg higher   the staff project has the featur that the effort of builder to bring inventori back into line will be a drag on product for some  e but that residenti invest will begin to turn up by the second half of next year   howev  this is a project  and if you are more pessimist on that score or want to give greater weight to downsid possibl from a risk manag standpoint  you might want to show some lean toward polici eas in the statement  the languag of the draft statement in altern a may do so   as summar in the bottom right panel  that draft point to    ongo weak in the hous sector    in row    excis the refer to    somewhat elev    inflat in row    and move the risk assess to balanc in row     the piec of what i have just been talk about have been put togeth in your last exhibit  which repres an ever so slight revis version of tabl   that circul on monday   in particular  in row   of altern b  the word    sustain    has been insert in the middl sentenc to rais the bar as to what it take for the committe to be convinc that inflat has moder   that conclud my prepar remark
are there ani question for     all right   if there are no question  then we   ll adjourn   we   ll see you at the dinner  and we will begin at      a m   meet recess  june               of     june            morn session
good morn  everyon   the gdp figur came out this morn      would you like to comment
thank you  mr  chairman   the bea publish this morn their so call final es  of gdp for the first quarter   top line came in slight lower than we had been expect in the  book       percent compar with the   percent that we had been expect   there were small miss in a smatter of categori  includ equip and softwar invest  net export  and inventori   our snap read  though  is that this releas will have littl  if ani  implic for our outlook  what we lost in the first quarter in inventori  for exampl  we might be inclin to regain in the second quarter in our project   so we think that our project for real activ will not chang as a consequ of this releas   we did get the upward revis to core pce price that we had been expect on the basi of the revis to the ppi for medic servic   core ppi was revis up from     to     percent
excus me   the core pce price index for the first quarter was revis up  exact as we had been expect on the basi of the ppi revis   thank you
are there ani question
may i ask  bill  whether there has been ani reaction in financi market to this
i think that peopl are take this in stride   the first quarter is old news
so  on your es   what we will be see tomorrow when we get the detail on price will be in line with what you have been expect   there was noth here to make you chang your view of that
we don   t know the detail of what we will get tomorrow  but there is noth here to condit our expect ani differ from what we had befor
okay   we are well advanc in our deliber here   we heard from   ye day on the action in the statement  and so we are prepar for the go round   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think what i heard ye day was consist with what i was think myself   we are in a pretti good spot  macroeconom and policywis   we have moder growth  low core inflat  which is not rise and could possibl be fall  suggest an under balanc of demand and potenti suppli that is in pretti good shape   total inflat is high  but unless the futur market are wrong again  total inflat should come down to core  and core is tell us that the balanc is about right   i didn   t hear anyth ye day in the forecast or in the anecdot   some were strong and some were weak   to contradict this pictur or to suggest that we have ani need to adjust polici   so i strong support altern b  market now rough agre with our outlook  at least in term of their expect for the feder fund rate and judg from our submiss on the forecast process   i don   t think we should be tri to chang those expect   i share everyon   s concern around the tabl about the risk on inflat   even if i don   t alway share everyon   s goal for where we might be go in the next few year  i think the risk are clear point to the upsid given the tight of domest and foreign market and the increas in headlin inflat  which could feed through to inflat expect  i like the altern b languag as it was hand out by   ye day   it is consist with ye day   s discuss that focus on the forecast of inflat in section   and     it reflect our uneas about whether recent improv will be sustain   i think it should leav expect approxim where they were  although i don   t have ani confid whatsoev in that judgment   i have been wrong too often for too mani year on these thing   i do think it has the virtu of reflect our discuss ye day   i have one suggest for sentenc   in section    which i think make it a littl closer to last  e in term of word   in the second sentenc      howev  a sustain moder in inflat      well  is that core or total   what is that about   i think we should go back to    inflat pressur         howev  a sustain moder in inflat pressur has yet to be convinc demonstr      that is what we talk about last  e   inflat pressur   then     moreov  the high level of resourc util has the potenti to sustain those pressur      i don   t think we need the word    inflat    twice   so with that small amend  i think altern b languag should do the t    thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i agre with governor kohn   i am in favor of altern b  of hold the rate where it is   the point that he just made may cover a suggest i had becaus i was think about what i heard ye day at the tabl   i heard two thing   one  in our discuss of inflat  i heard some concern about core inflat qua core inflat   i was go to suggest that the first sentenc be modifi slight to say that    read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month  but measur of overal inflat have remain stubborn high      then  i would strike    howev    and just say    a sustain moder in inflat pressur has yet to be convinc demonstr      i believ that is what i heard ye day   the other music to my ear  but i think it also reflect realiti   and i hear it more at the tabl   would be amend slight the last sentenc in that section   to read     moreov  the high level of global and domest resourc util has the potenti to sustain inflat pressur      laughter   that is what we said   that is what we discuss   we acknowledg that   i think it would show that we   re tune in to what   s go on  and that would be my recommend   otherwis  i would leav the rest of altern b unchang   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   befor i talk about polici  let me just note that it has been a tremend pleasur be a colleagu of presid   over the year and be an immedi neighbor of her    laughter    at feder open market committe meet   for one thing  she has done a great job as buffer between me and the presid of the new york bank    laughter
not alway easi  i might add    laughter
for anoth  i have gotten an up close view of some realli dazzl jewelri    laughter
pleas take that out of the transcript    laughter
core inflat has come down recent   but as i mention earlier  my sens is that it could well rise again   in ani event  it  sn   t seem like to fall much further   so i think we have to posit ourselv to do someth about inflat when we are more certain that the soft patch is behind us   i support the action in altern b   i support vinc reinhart   s languag from ye day   i am sure there will be more amend put on the tabl   i don   t want to start now by comment on everyth that has been put on the tabl   i will just say that  as we recogn at our last meet  if inflat fell  we would have a problem character inflat  and core pce inflat has inde fallen and could well go below that number on friday  accord to the staff   so it seem appropri to recogn that improv  the difficulti  of cours  is how to do so in a way that respect the fact that we haven   t yet decid whether our object for inflat is     or   percent   this is what motiv my letter to the committe last week   i didn   t think the first draft of altern b was suffici agnost on the question   my advis and i put our head togeth  and we couldn   t figur out a way to rewrit the statement to acknowledg the declin but not tip our hand toward prefer one object or anoth   so that is whi in my letter i propos that we go ahead and make a decis by choos between languag consist with     and languag consist with     after all  we are wide seen to want an inflat rate between   and    and we communic that via languag in our statement express displeasur with inflat below   and  more recent  express displeasur with inflat abov    sure enough  howev  some peopl with far more expertis in the my i art of draft fomc statement seem to have found a way around this  and the revis statement seem to finess this pretti well   the languag    moder in inflat has yet to be convinc demonstr      in other word  we don   t have to say how we feel about   percent inflat becaus we are not realli sure that inflat is   percent yet  now  i think this will finess the problem for the  e be   assum that it   finess the issu   and that is sort of a big    if      i don   t think we are like to be abl to finess this issu forev   if core inflat   spend some  e near   percent  as the  book forecast  then eventu it will becom convinc demonstr that inflat is inde   percent   more broad  the lack of a decis about our object will continu to pose difficulti both for our statement and our deliber  and i think it is go to be increas unsatisfactori to say we are still think about it   so i hope we can make progress on that soon   thank you
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  i am veri comfort with our current stanc at    percent   i think that it is  as i have said befor  modest restrict and that it will take us over  e to a lower inflat rate  on the statement itself  i have a coupl of comment   i am a littl uncomfort with the languag use in the output rational becaus we use the term    moder    to describ growth for the first half of this year and come quarter and this suggest that there will not be much chang in growth go forward as we use    moder    in both place   so i would like  if we could  to have someth in there that will describ the pickup in activ from the second quarter on that we have talk about   this would improv the character   that is just a suggest   i know how hard it is to craft these thing  but it is someth to think about  on the inflat rational  i   ll make two point   one  i think the statement carri pretti well   that is  inflat has come down recent  but we are not yet confid that progress will be maintain   two  on a twelv month basi  core inflat is higher than i find accept over the longer term  and would like to see further progress toward price stabil   perhap presid     s suggest would take us closer to my prefer in term of someth more explicit that promot further progress in reduc inflat  that would improv the statement   but  as i said  craft these thing is pretti difficult  i can live with the languag as it is  and those are just suggest to think about as we go forward from here   thank you
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   well  like other  i think the case for altern b is convinc   i don   t think we have ani reason to contempl chang the fed fund rate target at this point or tri to chang market expect about what we are up to   as far as the languag is concern  someth that came up at the last meet was not to make ani more chang than are necessari   some chang clear are appropri here becaus of the incom data and the way they have influenc the outlook   with that as a guid principl  i think altern b as draft is fine   i might have a mild prefer for the suggest that governor kohn made   i think that on the margin it is an improv  but i can live with b as draft   i think we are into nuanc here that probabl matter more to us than to anyon els    laughter
i am not so sure about that    laughter   thank you  presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i support altern b  and i also support the slight revis in the word that governor kohn recommend   one thing that i worri about and that i hope we can make clear in the minut   clear  we couldn   t do it in the statement   is that we have been in an unusu period   if you look at  book part    the evolut of the staff forecast  the staff forecast for both       and       has chang remark littl sinc last septemb   there has been a           or     here  but veri  veri littl chang   ordinarili over this span of  e you get some inform that chang your outlook in some signific way   i would hate to see us encourag the market to think that our project path of    percent for the fed fund rate is carv in stone   we need the market to respond to incom data  as we will have to do when we have some data that realli move us off dead center   so i hope that we would emphas   and it has sort of drift into insignific here   that    futur polici adjust will depend on the evolut of the outlook      i think it is veri import that the market understand that   it get into the broader discuss of communic  but i hope the minut will emphas the import of that part of our statement   thank you
thank you   we have seen some chang in polici expect  obvious  in the intermeet period   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i am veri comfort with the polici stanc   keep the rate at    percent   i think polici is in the right place   it is moder restrict but not restrict enough to caus us ani problem  particular in the hous area  in term of the statement itself  i am comfort with altern b  as written or as modifi by don kohn   we could talk a bit more about where that word    pressur    should be when you compar it with the last statement that we had  but that is a veri minor point   the key in this statement is deal with the fact that core inflat  accord to our forecast  is go to be     percent in the second quarter   it was     in the first quarter      in the second  and then it goe back up to     and       that is realli the key becaus  when you see inflat improv and then go back up again and juxtapos that against the longer term forecast that we have come up with  which show some improv in inflat over  e in       and        it is a delic balanc as to how we present this in the statement   i think the way altern b has been formul captur that   i had suggest a slight differ approach   i don   t feel strong about this  but you could also take that first sentenc in section    which say    read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month    and just add the phrase    but part of the improv may be transitori      but as i said  i am comfort with either formul here   i think it accomplish the same object
the minut should certain make that point becaus the staff has emphas that this may be transitori
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as peopl said befor  i  too  am in favor of keep the fed fund rate at    percent   the economi   seem to be rebound in the second quarter   the linger uncertainti over hous suggest that now is not the right  e to take more aggress action   i am in agreement with that  howev  the most current read on core inflat  while they have been good   just to reiter the point   i  too  believ there is a lot of evid that it may be transitori  and we have to be veri care about the fact that headlin inflat has not been veri cooper recent   inflat expect remain somewhat high from my perspect  and base on our previous discuss  that is a worri for me   i do tend to favor our announc an inflat target   i am not yet convinc that we will see inflat expect where they need to be to achiev my goal by the end of       if we look at the project narrat prepar by the committe member  we see that a major believ that the flat fed fund rate will get us to a pce core inflat of   percent or slight less by        if my own goal were   percent  i might be more comfort with a flat fed fund rate go forward   in fact  even the  book suggest that there is a model where that could happen   the bottom line is that i think we can   t avoid the eleph in the room   how can we sensibl talk about the forecast and appropri polici choic  either in real  e  as we do today  or prospect  when we can   t articul or agre upon what our object is   in the absenc of agre on a numer long run inflat object  we  as individu member  face increas difficult choic in arriv at an appropri polici stanc in ani given meet and even greater difficulti convey our committe   s decis to the public in an inform and transpar manner  individu could be advoc differ polici path either becaus they have differ model of the economi or differ inflat goal or both   at a minimum  i believ it would help our intern deliber   and it would certain help mine   if the caus of these differ in our project were more transpar   if we are think about our forecast as a communic devic  this would seem to even be more imper   that bring me to languag   i think the languag in the revis altern b is incred well craft and it tri to get around the problem that we are face in deal with what we meant by    elev    and how we think about this go forward  cite growth over the past two quarter as have been moder is a step in the right direct becaus it encourag the public and the market to look through shorter run  transitori movement   similar  we need to be look through transitori movement in inflat as well   as sever of you have point out in your comment on the propos statement languag befor the meet and as vinc point out in our last fomc meet  how we character the inflat outlook in our statement go forward is becom increas an issu sinc we have not agre on what our object is  i have two relat concern   the first is that  in elimin    elev     we run the risk of signal to the market that we are satisfi with the current rate of inflat  even though we haven   t communic what that mean   are we look forward twelv month   two year   three year   are we look backward at the past three month or the past twelv month   are we base our judgment on forecast of the next twelv month   are we concern onli about the core pce  or are we concern about headlin pce or some version of the cpi that is relev to our concept of inflat   as i said ye day  my concern is that there is consider confus in the marketplac about whi we focus on core and what it mean to us and how we communic that   intern  we are not clear on these issu  so how do we expect the public to divin our mean when we are not will to do it intern   in essenc  i think there will be a great deal of specul  even with this languag  about what we mean   will the market conclud what we think it should  or will we just accept whatev the market divin our intent to be  my second concern about chang the languag dramat is that it might convey to the market the notion that we are satisfi with inflat at current level   we may reveal through our project next month that we actual are forecast inflat to be lower than it is today on a twelv month basi   this was the point that presid   made in her memo   it creat somewhat of a contradict in how we describ our current view   if the market infer that we are satisfi with a year over year core at   percent and then our forecast come in at     or whatev  i think that will send some confus messag   on the other hand  releas the forecast later may clarifi for the market what we are expect and that may be the interpret   but there is no way for us to know what the outcom of that is without be more specif about what our object are   whi do we want to creat that much confus and specul in the marketplac about what we mean   i understand the desir to extric ourselv from the languag about core inflat  but i think we are be unnecessarili confus and cryptic in our choic of languag  and it will be difficult for us to control those expect given the way we are tri to manag the languag  i am not go to get engag in all the detail of the word   there must be peopl who are better at that than i am   but i would just like to conclud by note that  even if we are success   and  inde  we may be with the current languag in altern b   in wordsmith ourselv around this delic problem  it is not go to go away   we will continu to grappl with it in this environ   and we are go to continu to be push by the market  by comment  to clarifi what in fact we mean  so the problem isn   t go to go away even if we sort of finess our way around it in the short run   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support the polici action in altern b   i have some of the same concern that presid   and presid    and also presid   in her letter  rais about the increas difficulti in character inflat without have a clear sens of the committe   s longer term object on inflat   i also mention ye day that i have some concern about claim that inflat has moder at the same  e that we see the headlin measur rise   i find this to be a real problem  and i therefor like the suggest that presid   made   howev  i am concern about introduc yet anoth concept or anoth measur of inflat in our statement   i hope that through the minut we will be abl to rais our concern about the headlin measur stay stubborn high   but without further communic  introduc yet anoth concept  or anoth measur of inflat  in our statement is go to confus market   so i support make as littl chang as we can to the statement  and i am comfort with the way the most recent altern b is present   although i can also support governor kohn   s suggest about the word    pressur      so i support altern b  with some of the minor chang that governor kohn has made   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  am in favor of keep polici where it is   as i state ye day  i see the risk around growth as better balanc than they were  even given the potenti for the hous problem to be deeper and longer last than we might have expect earlier in the year   i remain concern about the risk that inflat will not continu to moder  but i am not wed  as i have said mani  e  to a particular low number   i would be as happi at   as at     and perhap even happier given that level that start with   seem to have downsid risk   or at least they did the last  e we were there  i am concern  howev  about the pressur on the economi  whether you think of them in term of headlin inflat or in term of the compon of headlin  particular energi cost  tight labor market  and a grow world   i think  although we may not want to put it in the statement  that   is right   our economi is subject to pressur from the rest of the world at this point and  relat to that  the fall dollar   a lot of thing could take inflat from it current moder level and push it back up  and that i would be veri concern about   it is true that financi condit have tighten slight  so market are start to do a littl work for us   but i believ that we need to continu with polici in a slight restrict stanc to provid some insur that the inflat pressur in the economi stay moder   stay with current polici is a good balanc between the prospect we see for moder growth and the prospect we also have recogn around the tabl for the potenti for inflat pressur to get wors  i support altern b   s languag   i want to say two thing   first  the more substant concern   i think that governor kohn   s thought about inflat pressur are slight better than the current languag   i was attract to the    transitori    languag that i think presid   rais first  and we fiddl around with it a bit in boston  but i have been convinc that    convinc demonstr    and    transitori    are equival   laughter   so i don   t want to battl about that at this tabl   the statement in section   is head in the right direct  and i would be in favor of it current form or the form that governor kohn suggest   second  i may be the onli one sensit to this  but in section   we have two sentenc that start with exact the same word   i never wrote that way when i was in school    laughter   there is an easi way to make that sentenc a littl better from an english composit point of view   but  again  that is t i to argu about at the tabl  so i guess i am fine
how about someth like    econom growth proceed at a moder pace
there are mani way to do it   i know that there are some object to this  but you could say     despit the ongo adjust in the hous sector  the economi appear to have grown at a moder pace over the first half of this year and seem like to continu grow moder over the come quarter      you could make it one sentenc   it is simpl  it is shorter  and it read better
we are talk about the economi  so mention it twice seem to be reason    laughter
we have two sentenc start exact the same way  though  in ani event  this is a nit in the overal scheme of thing
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  favor altern b and the current polici stanc   my interpret of the discuss around the tabl ye day is that we see encourag sign that the current polici appear to be produc the desir direct effect at least  or intermedi effect  so it seem to be work   there is still a fair degre of uncertainti  and base upon my long experi  i think it is a normal amount of uncertainti   so the current polici deserv be held  regard the polici statement  i favor the word in revis altern b that was distribut by vinc ye day afternoon becaus i think it captur the key point   the one that are import to me at least   and they are moder growth prospect  mention of the hous sector  better inflat read and prospect of continu moder  though it is still too earli to draw definit conclus   continu inflat pressur  and a continu weight to inflat risk with no suggest that the current level around   percent are accept for the long term   so for that set of reason  i favor the word as present
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain agre that polici is well posit  and we should leav it exact where it is   market have come around to our view  and i think our object in the statement should be to keep market expect align with our view and not to chang them  in term of the statement  i think that the current draft is veri much improv relat to the bluebook  and i have no problem in support the current languag   i like governor kohn   s propos  i think that it is a worthwhil chang   i do  howev  share mani of presid     s concern and think that we will have a lot of difficulti go forward   market are wonder what our long run inflat object is   they will certain note the omiss of the term    somewhat elev      it will rais a question about whether  if core inflat were to stabil at   percent  we would be satisfi with that or we would want to see it move lower   this statement is veri clever craft  and i think it succeed in finess that issu for today   i don   t have a problem  realli  with finess it for today  my own propos was design to say to market someth that i thought we could say without actual come to full agreement  even within the committe  about whether we have a singl long run inflat object   even if we don   t go announc a numer inflat object  our statement need to be consist with the project that we will be issu public   presid   point out that we will be issu a two year project that   show inflat come down   it seem to me that we could therefor remov the term    elev    and still say  as our project in a coupl week will confirm  that the committe expect under inflat to come down further without say exact how far   but i don   t feel strong about such languag  and i think altern b   a good job of resolv the problem for today   we will wait until anoth day  when we will have to face this again
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   like mani of you  i see no reason to materi chang market expect about our polici action   it is import that we not appear more comfort with either the level or the trend of inflat than we actual are   ani nod in that direct in the statement are ripe to be misinterpret  and the process of fix ani such nod would be t i   ye day vice chairman   said that financi market are in a delic place  and i would say that is particular relev in the context of this statement   so i would tri not to mess with market expect  given what we know about the state of our financi market   all that have been said  i support altern b   i like governor kohn   s amend  and i still think we are run a bit of a risk in suggest to the market that we are more comfort   but i don   t think there is realli much we can do at this point to mitig that risk more than the kohn amend suggest   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   as i mention ye day  i think we have seen some veri welcom sign of moder  but it is certain too earli to declar a victori   that is certain veri clear in the  book  as mani of you emphas   i also agre with governor kohn that we are in a reason good spot with moder growth like go forward and inflat and inflat expect reason contain   it is reason to think that they may be go down  but there   s a lot of uncertainti  and most of the uncertainti is to the upsid   it is sensibl to acknowledg realiti  and we should take out the word    elev    so that we are not seen as inflat nutter   we should acknowledg that some of the number have come down but be care about say that we are done  we are happi  or we are satisfi  as i mention ye day  an upturn in owner    equival rent could be come  there could be some uncertainti about pass through to core of the higher energi price that we have been see   there is continu strong world demand  and there could be some lag pass through effect of the previous declin in the dollar   i see all those as risk to the upsid  and so i think it   s import to convey that we are still concern about those thing   that said  i am veri support of where we are with altern b  in term of both the polici and the messag that is come from it  the type of amend that governor kohn mention is one that i veri much support for a number of reason   one  as he mention  it is more forward look   i think it is much better to talk about a sustain moder in inflat pressur rather than inflat  becaus that get us out of explain specif what we mean by    inflat      it   s a littl bit more general   if we had a clear goal  it would be benefici  given that we don   t have a clear goal  i think talk about pressur is good   it also has the valu of be forward look   two  the amend fit with presid  n   s notion that we should tri to keep as much in parallel with the previous statement   so mention moder in inflat pressur   i   m not sure i wrote down proper whether governor kohn suggest in the final sentenc of section      the potenti to sustain those pressur     take it back parallel to what we had befor  or whether he said    sustain inflat      so i would certain agre with    those pressur      three  put in    pressur    get us out of the potenti for get stuck   here we are say    sustain moder in inflat has yet to be convinc demonstr      well  if we take that out at some point  then we will be admit that it has been convinc demonstr  or at least market might interpret us as say that   i think that get us into a bit more of a box than i would like  and so talk about inflat pressur avoid the market   s take an implic that if we remov that at some point we have said     okay   it is convinc demonstr when for six month it is below x or below y      i think sinc we haven   t articul a goal yet  we don   t want to get into that box  but i do think that would be one of the valu of articul a goal   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you   i support altern b with the amend that governor kohn suggest  so i am veri comfort with that   the real issu for me here is one that i think has been express by sever other  what presid   call the    eleph in the room     which is that write the statement is get harder and harder   i think that we have a brilliant fudg this  e around  but it is not go to work forev  there are two sens in which i have a problem with this statement   one is the issu of the appropri level of inflat that we should be shoot for   this is realli two separ question   one is what we do about communic outsid  but there is also an issu about consensus insid the committe   i would find it much easier to agre to statement of certain type if  in fact  there were a consensus   as mani of you know  i am actual comfort with an inflat number of   percent   on the other hand  if the committe come to consensus for a lower number  i would be more than happi to be comfort with that   in fact  i would be will to have a statement that would reflect a lower number   i sens that this is true for other member of the committe   some who might be caught on the dovish side with   percent while some member are on the hawkish side at       but the differ between the hawk and the dove here is extrem slight   in fact  from more than five feet away  you couldn   t tell the differ between a hawk and a dove    laughter   that   s one issu that is veri import   i think it is go to becom more and more difficult as we go forward  as long as inflat evolv in the way that we expect   i mean  we could have bad news   inflat could actual start rise   and we   d have a differ kind of a problem   but let   s hope we don   t get into that problem   we want deal with the good news to be the problem  the second issu relat to core versus total   i am quit concern about the emphasi on core  not becaus i don   t think it is veri import to communic about core  particular when you get a big shift in someth like energi price and you don   t want to unhing inflat expect   in that context  we need to talk about core so that peopl understand that the current high inflat rate  in term of thing they care about   go to the gas station or go to the supermarket   are not actual someth that should chang their long run inflat expect   that   s whi the use of the core measur make a lot of sens   the problem is  as i read the research  that no one measur of core will alway be good   in fact  the core measur that we have evolv to has a lot of histori behind it  but it is not clear that it will be the best measur in all case   there are certain altern that i think will work in some case   a trim mean may some  be appropri  but at other  e it will not   so i think there will be a key problem  as has been discuss today  which is that at  e one core measur may make more sens than anoth core measur   our whole discuss is veri much in term of a particular core measur that exclud food and energi   that measur will some  be problemat for tell us about long run trend  particular if we think that energi chang are more perman or crazi polici about ethanol may be have a more perman effect in term of food price   in this context  we are go to have to deal with exact this issu go forward   also  a problem is that peopl do consum a lot of food and energi  and it is veri peculiar to act as though we don   t care about that  so i think that we have to grappl with these issu   they are part of our communic issu   the bottom line is that we are fool ourselv if we think that we are go to get away forev with not deal with them   we will have to figur out some way of do this   i think that we can do it becaus  in my read of what peopl on the committe have been say  the differ here are actual fair minor   it is the outsid world that want to make them into a big deal becaus do so sell newspap   but we do need to get to some consensus on these issu so that the outsid world see that the committe actual has uniti rather than differ   thank you veri much
thank you   governor   and other have refer to communic issu   i   d just point out that we will be address some of those later this morn   vice chairman
i actual agre with   and am happi associ myself with   much of what has been said   i am total comfort with altern b as amend by don or with the kohn   amend becaus you don   t need to repeat    inflat    twice in the end   laughter  and i think we should keep the rate as it is
i   m sorri  i heard my name but i didn   t hear what you said about me    laughter
chang the word    inflat    to    those
sever of you put on the tabl a bunch of broader question about communic go forward  which i would like to talk about now  but i think we should defer that until we come to the later convers   so i am fine with altern b as amend  i do think that a lot of you made mani interest suggest about the languag  but there is much virtu in make minim chang at the meet becaus  even if they sound small  i think it is hard in the few minut we have befor we vote to realli step back  take stock  and ask whether we alter the balanc in way that we fulli intend to be understood   thus i would be for minim in chang at the tabl general unless we have someth realli consequenti that we are tri to shift in the statement   in that spirit  i would keep the chang small and stay with a modest amend to altern b
thank you   well  we appear to be in consider agreement about the polici action    laughter   it is a good thing  i guess   not onli are we in agreement  but also the bond market is in agreement    laughter   i would just note that  in fact  the bond market is act as an automat stabil  respond to news  as we have discuss befor   i think we are in a veri good place  and our forecast process has serv us veri well   in that respect  i think this might be an appropri  e to congratul the staff  includ dave       son    reinhart  and the research director at the reserv bank who are here  for their tremend contribut to this process  which has realli been instrument in help us find the right level of polici and in build a lot of credibl in the market   so thank you veri much for your outstand work  with respect to the statement also  i didn   t hear a lot of dissent   first of all  let me say that i think governor kohn   s amend in section   are veri much to the point   so that would be    a sustain moder in inflat pressur      first  the word    pressur    dilut to some extent the attent to the month number   second  as a number of peopl have said  it is a broader concept  and it can be constru as includ some of the headlin issu and the oil  commod  and so on price that we are concern about   so i think it is definit an improv  and so i would like to recommend it  on section    just a coupl thing   one is that i would hesit to tri to indic grow strength in the second half  for a coupl of reason   first  at least in term of the  book  that acceler is relat modest   certain not at all a definit uptick  by continu to use the languag of    moder pace     i think we signal that we are not go to take the second quarter as necessarili indic a new reacceler of growth  we think that the second quarter repres  at least part  a transitori increas in the growth rate   second  professor    laughter  was correct about the qualiti of write in the section   the last statement began with the term    econom growth      i am kind of ambival about whether or not to do this  but we could say     econom growth appear to have been moder dure the first half of this year  despit the ongo adjust in the hous sector
a littl more variat   is that accept
could you read that again
the propos is     econom growth appear to have been moder     and then it goe on  as it say here     dure the first half of this year  despit the ongo adjust in the hous sector      i see nod  so i think that is accept   i   m sorri   no
there is a tens question   the first half of the year isn   t over
yes  it is   almost    laughter   well  i mean  that is no differ from what we alreadi have
it   s the word    appear     which is fine
the content is no differ
is everyon okay with the languag
yes   well  at least that solv the instant problem
you do know that english professor get paid veri littl money   laughter
that is what i   m go to   veri littl money    laughter
i think presid   is entitl to her chang  given that she is valedictori in this    laughter   so with that chang      econom growth appear to have been moder dure the first half    et cetera   that would be my recommend   are there ani further comment
mr  chairman

the entir statement     the feder open market committe decid today to keep it target for the feder fund rate at    percent  econom growth appear to have been moder dure the first half of this year  despit the ongo adjust in the hous sector   the economi seem like to continu to expand at a moder pace over come quarter   read on core inflat have improv modest in recent month   howev  a sustain moder in inflat pressur has yet to be convinc demonstr   moreov  the high level of resourc util has the potenti to sustain those pressur      the last section is the same
this is just one observ   the second sentenc of section    where we talk about capac util  seem to be redund onc you put    inflat pressur    in the first sentenc
well  look at the may statement   we have been do that for a while now    laughter   are there ani other question or comment   if not  i   d like to call for a vote

thank you   the coffe is not yet brew   laughter   so whi don   t we go on to the next phase of the meet   we turn to   to discuss communic issu
thank you  mr  chairman  for give me the normal role as speed bump   in that effort we are now hand out materi to which we will be refer   if someon will let me know when the doughnut truck come  i   ll pick up    materi use by mr  reinhart is append to this transcript  appendix     the pace    laughter   the subcommitte on communic began it work onli fifteen month ago   laughter  which seem like ye day  at least in geolog  e    given the consider discuss the committe has had sinc then on it communic polici  it seem appropri to take stock   in particular  i sent around a list of question design to elicit your view on the potenti role of the survey of econom project  the minut  and the statement in refin your dialogu with the public   the materi with the cover     fomc communic     is design to help to organ this discuss   with regard to the enhanc econom project process  the survey result circul on june    report general support for the key featur of the process  with three notabl except  given at the top of exhibit     the subcommitte tri to address those concern in the modifi project process use for this meet  so the first question list at the top of your first exhibit boil down to  how did they do   did the chang address the concern you express in answer to the may survey   in particular  some of you prefer not to share your forecast submiss  most on the ground that it might make the discuss of the econom outlook at the meet more inflex   but some of you held that share was import  both to help inform your intern deliber and as a sourc of materi for the forecast write up   as a compromis  the submiss were circul on an anonym basi  with an opt out claus that one of you took this  e   some of you were concern about specif   particular in write down an explicit path for the feder fund rate and in quantifi uncertainti   those question were turn into qualit one that ask for comparison with the staff polici assumpt and histor uncertainti   anoth process question is item     in what form should the project be releas         s memo identifi the three option list in the exhibit  which basic differ by the extent to which the narrat descript is tailor to suit differ purpos   option   is one size fit all   the staff would produc a singl document describ your econom project  which would be drop into the committe approv minut and repeat verba  in the board approv monetari polici report   the chief advantag of this option are that the vet process is tri and true and that there will be consist across feder reserv document   the disadvantag is familiar to anyon who has bought cloth off the rack in a big box retail   the fit will not be perfect across document   option   open the door to some varieti   the committe approv minut would includ a brief descript of the forecast  as is the practic now   a separ document would give a fuller account of the project   in that case  there would be more flexibl as to who approv the document and when it is releas   this pose a tradeoff that has come up in previous discuss in that the earlier the narrat is releas  the more use it will be in explain the polici decis but the more complic the govern process will be   option   is the bespok altern in which separ  complet discuss would be prepar for the minut and the monetari polici report   the fit will be better  but carri it out will be more expens  and even subtl differ may draw attent   the third question ask when the project should be final   the choic essenti are the day of the meet  the end of the week of the meet  or as late as practic to be close to the offici releas of the document   but you have a more fundament question to answer first   what is the purpos of the econom project   if they are suppos to help explain your most recent polici choic  they should be condit on the same inform set that the polici decis is   that is  they should be final as soon as possibl after the meet so that they are not contamin by post decis inform   that is the rule we now use for the minut   if  in contrast  the committe   s object is to releas an up to date assess that shed light on futur polici action  then the individu project should be nail down onli close to public day   the middl ground of close the book on the project a few day after the meet seem unsustain to me  particular if the narrat descript is to be includ in the minut   the first  e an import piec of news hit within the window between polici decis and updat deadlin  the explan of the polici action will becom muddl   some immedi feedback on that score will be help becaus the schedul for this round allow for your project to be updat through close of the week   if so  you would seem to have to incorpor friday   s chockful data calendar   do you realli want to do that  particular as it may lead to confus in the minut about what you knew and when you knew it   the next exhibit focus on the minut   you have     year of experi under your belt in publish the minut three week after the day of the polici decis   in that  e  the document has receiv more attent from you in the edit process and from market particip and the press on it releas compar with the previous regim of delay public until after the next meet   how do you assess the benefit and cost of further expedit the minut   the benefit  list at the left  are the same as discuss in        a document made public closer to the day of the decis will be more of an aid to the privat sector in understand the current outlook and the prospect for polici   in that regard  you will be abl to use that materi from the minut for public statement more prompt   a speedier releas may facilit make the post meet statement shorter or less substant   i point out  though  that my sens in      was that a few of you support expedit the minut in the hope that the statement would subsequ be shorten  but that did not pan out   to appreci the cost list at the right  you should understand that we use the three week after the meet part to accommod your busi schedul and part to provid a cushion so that the draft iter can converg without a dissent vote   the cost  then  would includ your increas effort to ensur that your schedul align with that of the draft and approv process for the minut  you should also recogn that less draft  e might lead to more compromis that make the minut less inform so as to avoid dissent  and more staff resourc will be need to prevent error   simpli put  with fewer hour  we need more eye look at the document   of cours  the decis on expedit the minut further may interact with other potenti decis on communic polici  especi those regard the enhanc project process   in particular  if you decid to includ a narrat descript of your forecast in the minut  you may want to delay ani speed up of the minut until you are comfort with the new process   you may also want to consid way to make draft and comment easier   that is the subtext under question     how do you assess the current content of the minut  includ the staff   s descript of recent data   some  e ago  it was suggest that the first eight to ten page  which provid a backward look review of recent econom data  be releg to an annex   in a similar vein  it could be describ explicit as a staff summari   with it product perhap even link up mechan to a modifi part   of the  book   that way  you would be respons for comment onli on the forward look and polici portion of the document  and some of the pressur on staff  e could be reliev   if you have ani other view on the content of the minut  today probabl would be an appropri  e to rais them   the last exhibit rais issu that have not been address for some  e  name the role of the post meet statement   some of you might consid the statement as a vehicl design onli to convey coars signal about polici  with more nuanc inform provid in subsequ communic   other might see it as import that the statement be abl to stand on it own as a reason complet explan of the committe   s monetari polici decis and intent   what is the appropri role of the statement in light of the chang to the committe   s other communic devic  question      the statement   s role  which can be describ in term of a monetari polici rule  has vari over the year   at  e the statement has provid hint about the odd on futur action by character the left hand side of the polici rule   that is  by direct address the path of the feder fund rate  at  e the statement has describ the right hand side of the polici rule   that is  the risk to the dual macroeconom object   that is anoth way of state question     if you believ that the statement should provid guidanc about the outlook  should that guidanc be couch in term of the polici interest rate or the dual object   if you decid to describ the econom outlook  you will have to settl on the polici assumpt under that project  as in question     the condit possibl includ the appropri path of monetari polici  some read on market expect  or an unchang polici rate   this choic may interact with the role you envisag for your econom project in explain polici decis   as for question    your ambit regard the complex of the statement will determin how much  e need to be devot to draft   becaus of constraint as to how long you can meet as a group  a complic statement necessit pre meet consult   that may get the nuanc right  but it may also forc you to settl on a polici view befor you have had the benefit of consult with your colleagu on the committe   moreov  it shift some of the polici discuss out of this room  for which a transcript is kept and minut are produc  and into inform back channel   a statement that could be agre upon most within the confin of these four wall is probabl one that is short and relay a routin risk assess  given your long held view that    nineteen peopl cannot edit the statement on the fli      question    rais one last govern issu   who own the statement   at the inaugur of the age of statement in       the committe formal direct the chairman to explain it polici action   over the year  the statement has come to be view as a committe product  with the word some  view to be at least as import as the immedi polici action   but you still vote onli on the polici action and the risk assess   should that continu  or should you be ask to vote on the statement in it entireti   these three set of question are interrel  and there is no obvious place to wade into this thicket   one possibl would be to conduct two go round on these issu  with the first cover your view on the enhanc forecast and the minut and the second address the statement   the first two issu are close relat and perhap closer to closur   i suspect that you are closer to the begin of your discuss of the statement than to the end   that conclud my prepar remark
thank you   are there ani question   vice chairman
vinc  it   s a littl unclear from what you   ve circul what the subcommitte is recommend or presum about the piec of materi that would go into the monetari polici report   do you want to say just a littl about option there   i assum you want peopl to comment on that question  too  and that goe to the core of this next stage of evolut in the transpar
that   s a complic govern issu becaus it relat to both what the committe approv potenti and what the board approv becaus the monetari polici report is by law a report of the board of governor explain the monetari polici action of the committe   the short answer is that it depend on what you want   one possibl   that   s option one   is to write a narrat includ in the minut  have it approv by the committe  and then essenti lift that out and make that a signific chunk of part   of the semiannu monetari polici report   then the word would be the same in both place
those choic i think i understand  but i was realli think about the pictur   you circul a whole differ set of new thing  innov pictur that show dispers  uncertainti  balanc of risk  histogram  and so forth   i guess you don   t need to answer this question  but do you want peopl to react  in the first round at least  with a view on which pictur we think should be part of the narrat
if you don   t express a view here  you   ll have a chanc in comment on what the staff propos   our intent was to take a small subset of those chart and tabl that were essenti for explain the central tendenc project themselv and the dispers of view and to put them into the narrat   the draft that we would circul to you would have that inform  and from there  we could take your comment
how small a subset
about the same size as the last draft we circul  which was  in fact  circul as an appendix in       s memo
i didn   t mean that   i   m sorri   i meant the graph show the evolut of the central tendenc with thing plus the histogram   that   s what i meant by subset
excus me  but the histogram we   re talk about are the individu differ
yes   well  that   s what we circul last  e in the draft write up of the may discuss
so you would have the central tendenc analysi that we have and then further amplif  which would show individu differ of the nineteen member of the committe
potenti that   s what we would have
i   m just tri to understand what we   re go to talk about
the staff draft of the june narrat will be similar in structur to the may narrat   that  howev  is onli the first draft   given that we intend it to be similar in structur to the may narrat  then we would includ a coupl of histogram   we also ad in this packag a revis pictur of the central tendenc   you know  the red bar and the box and whisker chart   we intend to includ that   so we didn   t view ani materi upgrad in the pictori descript of the forecast   we tri to come up with as fat a packag as we could for your intern discuss so that you could see how the individu forecast of your colleagu vari and also are relat   for instanc  between the unemploy rate and the growth rate and between the inflat rate and the unemploy rate
i think governor   preced me
we   re have question for   now
this is just an intervent
i think i had presid pool first and then governor     presid pool
vinc  in think about the possibl benefit of acceler the releas of the minut  can you name a  e when that would have produc a benefit   i understand the cost becaus we all understand the cost  but i don   t know of ani case in which releas the minut five day earlier would have bought us anyth   at ani rate  we need to think that through befor we bear all those cost
the particular case that i can imagin would be employ report   if it take five fewer busi day   and that might be a littl speedier than the staff can actual deliv   ani cut of those busi day  particular if it get past that friday  produc the chanc that there would be anoth employ report between your polici decis and the releas of the minut   this also interact with the chairman   s tes oni schedul  which is someth we have to think about   do you want to be in the posit of have the minut more like to be out befor his tes oni  or would you prefer to have the minut out after the tes oni   i can imagin both benefit and cost associ with that
it probabl would be help if we could have more detail with regard to how that might work and how often those case would aris becaus the cost would occur continu   as you emphas  there are also some risk to acceler the minut becaus do so reduc the amount of  e to think it all through and make sure that noth has slip through inadvert
there were a coupl of statist in     s memo in particular about how it interact with the standard semiannu tes oni schedul
anoth observ somewhat in the same vein   regard the econom project  as i comment earlier  we have been think about this dure a period in which the forecast hasn   t chang much   the situat has been pretti benign from the point of view of anybodi who has been do this for veri long   one thing that  i think we need to work on is how this would have work   would it like have been construct   at a  e like the fall of       the  e of septemb           or the  e in earli      when the economi was sink realli rapid   we need to work on those case and not just think about the project in the context of the relat benign period that we   ve had   i realiz that that involv more staff work  but it seem to me essenti that we think all of that through befor we start to do it  one other comment   i view the whole communic process that we   ve been go through as increment  and i   m a littl worri that we   re bite off too much at onc here   we should think about a realli pare down set of releas here if we   re go to expand the process with the idea if all that work well  then we   d take the next step
let me just say that there   s go to be a go round  everyon will have an opportun
well  i   m sort of ask him to reflect on that    laughter
governor    do you have a question
yes  i do have a question   just a clarif   one thing that we talk about earli on when you gave us inform was that there is the inform regard our view about whether risk was greater or less than usual and about the skew of the risk   you might also want to includ in the document that would go out inform to guid peopl on what is normal so that you would have the thing that we actual sent out  which was either a pictur or the tabl show the forecast error   is it your view that part of it would be not onli the chart that we actual respond to but also the background inform
right   i believ the tabl of uncertainti was one thing that the subcommitte view as use to includ  not the three big fat bar that show uncertainti variabl by variabl   that was use background for write the paragraph in the narrat that talk about the committe   s percept of risk
i   m just tri to rememb   did the tabl have the uncertainti for the variabl
the tabl had histor variabl come from a coupl of differ sourc
the  book and frb us
right   that would be a refer tabl in the write up   the narrat would say     in the committe   s view  current uncertainti was about at histor experi      then in the narrat descript of the risk  we   d use the inform that you provid about the asymmetri of those risk   i don   t think we envis show a particular chart
right  but the key idea is that we do have a tabl with actual some number as part of the document   thank you veri much
presid     i   m sorri   you had an intervent
that   s all right   i have one question and a plea   the question is  have we decid about how mani  e we   re do these forecast and i just miss the decis
will we be meet four  e a year
that   s what we have to discuss   that   s on the tabl
okay   it didn   t seem to fall into this huge list of thing   the plea is  pleas tell us what you want us to focus on first   there   s so much stuff here that goe into the heart of everi communic issu that we   ve talk about over more than the past eighteen month   do you have in mind a plan of action for which you need us to weigh in on someth first and then other thing second and third
our hope was that we could come close to closur on enhanc project
that led natur into the minut becaus the project   s write up would be in the minut   the statement would be put off for a second round  and i person wouldn   t be surpris if we never got to the second round    laughter   we could tri   i think we should focus first on the project   what   s in them   and then how they might relat to the product of the minut
so realli to home in on what we all want to see out of the project is job number one
right   we would like to come out of this with some decis made about the way forward
is the subcommitte make a recommend on ani of these
no   all along we   ve view our job as bring thing to the tabl and help the fomc to make the decis and not make recommend  and we   ve stuck with that     is roll her eye    laughter
this may get us slight ahead of ourselv  but i think it   s import to what we   re ask to do now   it make sens to get peopl to focus on how comfort they are with what has been on the tabl regard the rang of option on project and to say what they   re comfort with and what they   re not comfort with  but as i see this plan  you   re still build in some  e for refin over the next sever month to get this to the point where it   s readi for prime  e   so i don   t think you   re ask peopl   you realli can   t becaus you   re not quit there yet   to commit right now to view on all specif attribut of this   it seem to me you   re a step short of that   broad element of the packag on project would then provid a basi for the subcommitte and the staff to refin this further over the next sever month   that   s what i understood the plan to be   i think you   re right  cathi   there   s a lot here   you can get a lot from ask peopl to give that broader orient and still recogn that this is go to need a littl refin   is that fair  don
yes   as   point out  we   ll have anoth round  a practic round this  e and mayb even anoth one
are there other question for
i had  mr  chairman  a  e question      you said that includ the write up of the project with the minut   either as a separ document or integr   might argu for not shorten the  e   but how could we do that with the chairman   s tes oni    sn   t that actual forc the shorten of the  e
well  i would make a distinct between when the committe approv the document and when the committe releas the document public   you might not want  for instanc  to releas the minut befor the chairman   s tes oni becaus it   sort of step on that messag
i agre with that
but if the write up is in committe approv minut and a board approv monetari polici report  you   re go to have to figur out a mechan by which the committe sign off on the write up so that it will be the same in the report  the possibl are that if it is an annex or a drop in portion of the minut  the committe may veri well need to have two edit schedul   that is  comment on the narrat would have to be final by a certain date so that it could go into the report and comment on the complet minut could take longer   that   s one possibl
presid pianalto  do you have a question
yes  i have a question on the  e of the chairman   s tes oni   are those date set by law
the law say no later than februari    and juli      in practic  the committe some  allow for some slippag   the last few  e it has tend to be earlier than that   so that   put a t in term of your plan horizon   you also have some flexibl about when you schedul the meet
i understand that the doughnut truck has arriv   laughter   so give us a twenti minut break for coffe  and we will continu this discuss   coffe break
whi don   t we reconven   we had some hurri consult dure the break about how best to proceed with this discuss   break with our usual practic  we decid that it might be best for me to begin and to provid you with my sens of a broad schemat of how i see us go forward with our communic  in particular with the project  which i view as be central to our plan   i note that peopl can justifi complain that they haven   t had enough preliminari inform for this discuss  which i   m about to give you   but let me also say  first  that there will be  of cours  opportun to react in the round to follow and  second  that we will continu to poll you and to consult with you and that we   re not go to be final this for some  e yet  so in the interest of tri to give you someth to react to  let me just present an overview of how i see this go  the extend project that we have been experi with can be a central critic element of a new and expand communic strategi that will  in fact  address mani of the concern that were rais today   i   ll be veri explicit about that as i go through this   in particular  what are the element of these expand project    first  i recommend that we extend the project horizon   we have use a third year in our experi so far   i think that might be the right solut  but let me just leav open for discuss the possibl of either use a fourth year or replac the third year with a third through fifth year averag or someth of that sort   sort of a long term averag   second  i recommend that we releas this project quarter   that would mean approxim quarter becaus the calendar is not conduc to an exact quarter releas schedul   that would mean that two of the project would appear in the context of the monetari polici report   this is not a central concern  but my thought at this point would be that we should revisit the monetari polici report and tri to make it more inform   there is a lot that we could do to make it better   to includ more inform  includ box  and essenti make it a more effect public   that would be  as now  twice a year   perhap on the off quarter we could have a small releas of some sort  or we could includ the project in the minut   that   s one of the issu that we need to discuss as we go forward  third  i think that in our project we ought to project a total inflat measur  as mani peopl have note  there is confus   and even some resent  i would say   about what appear to be our excess attent to core inflat   project a total inflat measur throughout the project would  first of all  clarifi that our definit of price stabil is in term of total inflat and would give us opportun to explain in this document  in speech  and elsewher not onli whi we do look at core inflat  how we use core inflat  and it role as a forecast mechan but also   as presid   and other have mention   that it   s not a necessarili suffici statist and that we should look at other thing as we tri to forecast overal inflat  i would go even further here   just  again  to be concret   i   ve waver myself on think about which particular measur   i   ve had discuss with the staff  and i am not wed to anyth in particular at this point  but current i am lean toward suggest that we use the pce deflat as our measur of inflat   it   s a technic better measur  it use chain weight and has a lower weight on shelter cost  which have their obvious problem   it has disadvantag   there is a signific nonmarket compon  for exampl  an argument can be made for the cpi on the ground that it is better known although  as has been point out to me  if we begin to realli focus on the pce  it may endogen becom better known   anoth point to make here is   and i don   t want to get too distract with this   that sinc there is a fair stabl wedg between the pce and the cpi  we might be abl to use the cpi in some of our communic as long as we   re clear that we are not pick and choos as far as our object and our definit of price stabil are concern  anoth compon of the project that we have been do  which i think is veri valuabl  is ad a consider amount of both qualit and quantit inform to our project   that includ  in particular  our explan of the qualit materi that we have been submit   describ the forecast  the risk to the forecast  the sens of uncertainti that we have  and so on   and i think that will be veri valuabl   as i said  we can combin this with other support inform   there are various way to do this  there could be a separ document four  e a year   it could be in the minut   i suggest one possibl  which is to includ it in the monetari polici report twice a year and keep it in the minut or as a separ document on the off quarter  let me talk a bit about what this would accomplish for us  and then i will summar that at the end   first of all  the public is veri hungri for inform about the feder reserv   s outlook and our sens of the risk to the economi   we have  as i have note befor  the best forecast group in the world   we have use inform to add to the debat   by provid that inform  i think we can help peopl make better decis and understand polici and the economi better   in particular  the more we are forc to explain our predict and our forecast  the more credibl we   ll be and we   ll be invit discuss  reaction  and debat that will  i think  make our project better   one of the advantag of transpar is that we begin to interact more with the outsid world  second  i think we should assum op  monetari polici   i had some other idea befor  but in the end  i think that   s the right thing to do   an import implic of assum op  monetari polici is that the project therefor becom essenti  as everyon understand  a plan for how we propos to steer the economi  if you will   subject  of cours  to all the qualif of uncertainti  forecast problem  and so on   it give an explicit road map with refer to both side of our mandat about how we expect our polici to move the economi toward our object over the next three year   i think that   s veri import for a number of reason  such as account and transpar   but let me give you an exampl of where i think it   s particular use  one issu we have been discuss is the appropri period for achiev price stabil  and two suggest are out there   one is sort of the standard bank of england approach  which say that we have a two year horizon   we have certain concern about that   in particular  it  sn   t necessarili take into account  at least not explicit  the state of the real economi  the initi condit  how far we are from price stabil  and so on  anoth possibl is to say  well  it   s just an aspir number   it   s a long term number  we don   t have ani particular schedul for get there   peopl have rais the obvious object   where   s the disciplin   where   s the credibl associ with that   so  as we understand this  we can explain to the public that the project go a long way toward solv this problem becaus they show how far out we think we have to go to get to what we and the public view as be reason level of price stabil   so it   in a veri import way solv the problem of the appropri horizon  now  i should add a point that will come up  which is that one could object that the project are not the same as a committe forecast   we are not go to come togeth and make a singl forecast that the entir committe buy into  except to the extent that we do have consensus build  which we will have over  e in our meet   that aspect of it could be view as a lack of clariti   howev  the aggreg process   reflect uniqu featur of the feder reserv  includ it institut structur  the larg size of committe  the geograph dispers of it membership  and our longstand willing to accept and encourag divers view within the committe   so we won   t be forc some kind of artifici consensus   there will be opportun for dispar   in particular  i would recommend that we provid inform to the public about the cross section distribut  as we alreadi do   but my inclin   and peopl can react   would be to provid the entir cross section distribut to convey the sens of uncertainti or the sens of dispers of view  and that will be inform in the same way that the vote in the boe   s monetari polici committe are inform   howev  as in the case of the bank of england and other bank  even though we won   t be have a common forecast  nevertheless   as i think we have alreadi seen    the prepar of our individu forecast   creat a certain amount of disciplin and has been use for us in think about our forecast  a veri import question is what is convey by the third year project  and i think that they are at the heart of the innov creat by this step   assum that we   re not too far from the steadi state initi  which i think character our current situat  it is evid that the third year project   or  altern  the third through fifth or howev we decid to do it   reveal a lot of inform about our view on sustain long run growth  our view on sustain unemploy  and  of cours  our view of what price stabil is   i simpli take note of the fact that the latest project show the central tendenc of the committe   s inflat object to be     to   percent on the core pce deflat   i actual   and i   m speak entir for myself   would be not at all displeas if that becam known as the feder reserv   s comfort zone or inform definit of price stabil   first  it   s a compromis among differ view   second  i realiz that i   m complicit in the   to   percent comfort zone  but i do note that the lowest twelv month core pce  in       was        i don   t think we   d be comfort with inflat rate below   percent even though we   re obvious will to toler inflat rate slight abov     it   s not symmetr  and i think that the comfort zone reveal by our third year forecast would be reason and would provid use inform  some would be concern that we   re also provid inform about the committe   s view on sustain growth and sustain unemploy   i am not that concern about it   i think that a transpar committe should do that   howev  for those who are concern about possibl risk  i   ll point out that committe project will have a lot of dispers that probabl will essenti encompass most reason es  of these variabl   moreov  there will be forecast error around those project  and as we get inform about product and other factor  we will be abl to updat those es   i don   t think that they will be a major constraint   i think that they will  in fact  just provid some inform to the public  i note that some particip have talk about an opportunist approach to disinfl  which still seem to have some adher around the tabl   that is  peopl who may say     well  i   m sort of for   percent now  but i can see over  e  if the opportun aris  veri gradual move down to     and so forth      obvious  the reveal prefer shown by the third year project  sn   t distinguish between those thing   one thing that might happen   and i don   t think it   s necessarili a bad thing   is that  if opportunist disinfl happen and those individu therefor lower their project  the committe   s project might drift down a bit   i don   t think it would drift up   i think there would be a strong resist to that   but it would be respond appropri to chang condit  and i don   t think it would chang veri much  so the fact that it would not be liter rigid is not necessarili a problem to me  some thought will have to be given to vocabulari  how we describ these thing   i think that i will myself want to talk about the committe   s project   it   s not quit right to call them a target becaus we will not have agre univers and chosen a number onc and for all   that be said  i think that the normat implic of the number will not be miss by the public  and that it will do a lot to clarifi peopl   s view on what the committe is tri to do and will also be use for intern discuss   in particular  in tes oni  speech  and the like  i would use the project as my refer point as i talk about what the committe is tri to do  where we are head  and what we think is the best way  to get there  so let me summar what i think this compon of our communic strategi could do for us  note that some other thing could come in the packag   perhap fa  minut  chang in the statement  and so on   but let me just talk about what i think is best for us   first  it is go to allow us to provid consider more inform to the public and in a more  e way becaus it will be quarter   second  it will give us an opportun to clarifi how quick we intend to move toward our object   it will give us a way to deal with the problem of the horizon   those of you who were at the st  loui fed   s confer on inflat target in      might rememb a paper by board staff member jon faust and dale henderson in which they talk about inflat target as be focus on the mean of the object but need also to focus on the varianc   what they mean by that is the speed with which miss are fix and that some regim are not adequ construct to deal with that   again  this would allow us to be veri explicit and veri account about how we return to our object  third  it would allow us  again  to move to total inflat as our object and to clarifi how we use core inflat as an input into forecast total inflat   fourth  it would clear up the current confus about comfort zone and individu view   we   re not go to take a vote on the particular number  but i think a reason way to proceed is to consid the rang of third year project as be a kind of consensus view of what most of us think is an appropri measur of price stabil   again  i think the normat implic will be clear   fifth  it will improv our intern discuss and decisionmak  we   re alreadi see that   in fact  it has highlight some problem that we have in our communic and in our coher   this will help  i think   sixth  it respect the fed   s uniqu institut structur  the natur of it committe  it govern procedur  and it attent to divers of view   moreov  it build explicit on a communic devic that we   ve been use for thirti year   in that respect  it will look in some sens as increment even though i think it   s veri substant   but i think with it increment natur  the transit risk   be they market risk  polit risk  and so on   will be more moder than they would otherwis possibl be  so this is an outlin   i know that some of you may think that this is a bridg too far  some of you will think that i   ve onli start on the road to damascus here    laughter   as i said  there will be an opportun now to go around as you talk to give ani reaction you might have to this   also  i have not been veri specif about the question rais in exhibit   that vinc put out   these thing bear on the detail  but i   m pretti flexibl about them   i think i   d like to see the minut move up if possibl  consist with do all of what i   ve describ   otherwis i   m pretti flexibl about this  let me just say a few other thing about go forward   this  togeth with the other element  is part of an ongo process   we   re not go to lock this down   i will ask the subcommitte to continu in exist   certain we   re go to have to move forward  if we all agre that this is the direct that we want to go  to implement the detail of the minut  the monetari polici report  the collect of this inform  and so forth  i would like to talk about the whole packag  whatev we come to  in the fall   that is  in the next three or four month   i will surpris don by say this   it would be veri nice if i could have someth to point to in octob  but it   s certain possibl and i think it   s veri import for us to move deliber   if that   s not possibl to do in a safe and clean way  then we could wait until januari to actual deliv some product   so that is a question   i think that what will happen is that we will see the reaction we get   we will see how the public and the market respond   we may have to take further step   when we see how this goe  the market and the public will tell us what they need to know that we   re not yet tell them  and then we can move it still further if we need to   but my sens is that  with some of the detail that we need to work out   and your comment are more than welcom  as they are with the entir vision   as a central part of a packag  this would move us in a good direct   so i   m go to stop there  and we   ll have a go round   did you have an intervent
i have just a question   in communic the project  what are you suggest there  mr  chairman   is it four  e a year that we would put the project out with commentari
okay   fine   thank you
let me give governor kohn a chanc to lead off as the chairman of the subcommitte  and then we   ll have a full go round   don
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with and strong support the path that you   ve outlin for us for the reason you   ve articul so nice   let me add a few thing and then give a few specif   i think this would be a veri import contribut to enhanc the understand of the public  the market  and the legisl about what we   re do and whi   just to emphas someth that you just mention  mr  chairman  this systemat approach to think about the risk and the symmetri and the asymmetri around the risk will be veri use in our communic with the public  and a systemat and regular approach to talk about the chang in the forecast will be veri use to explain to the public how our forecast is evolv   from my perspect  these explan are among the most import thing that we can do   the write up that presid hoenig was ask about is key here   to my mind  the forecast is realli a framework for put all of our explan  our write up  in place  and is a disciplin process for explain our thought about how and whi the economi is evolv   i think it   s more those explan than the specif number that we use to educ the public about what we   re think  how we think thing are develop and  look at the risk and the uncertainti  how we   re like to react to incom inform   this would put that endeavor on a much more systemat track than it has been in the past when it has reli from  e to  e on ad hoc speech by the chairman or on mention of it in the announc  minut  or whatnot   so i think this will be veri good  i agre with you that the third year forecast are most peopl   s prefer for the long run   i admit to be that opportunist disinfl to whom you were refer   mayb there are other around the tabl   i don   t know   i wrote down     for year three  and i might prefer someth a littl lower over  e   but given the start place  i thought the welfar benefit of go down to     or     or even     or     were less than the welfar cost of the potenti unemploy that we would incur do that   i   m also somewhat skeptic about the credibl bonus from make announc   but obvious  i wouldn   t have written down a number that wasn   t veri heavili influenc by my object over  e   so the public will be correct in interpret those third year number as pretti much where the individu member of our committe want to go even if it   s not exact the right number   i note that the     to   that   s in our forecast is not that wide a rang   it   s narrow than the inflat target of some countri  like new zealand and australia   so it won   t contribut that much to uncertainti   i also note that in   leahi   s chart ye day the inflat compens chang in the unit state over the past coupl of month were about the same as in the inflat target countri   i don   t think there   s a huge amount of uncertainti about what we   re do   now  some peopl might think that the inflat expect are tie at too high a level   i think that presid   point that out   but i don   t think that the public is afflict with a whole lot of uncertainti about what our object are relat to some other  inflat target countri  i see this as sort of a risk manag approach to talk about our long run inflat object   we get this out there  see what the reaction are  see what kind of question there are  and then proceed   if it look as though the right thing to do is to actual vote in the committe about what our long run object is  we can do that then   but we haven   t gone that extra step  which we will never be abl to take back again if there   s some sort of reaction that we haven   t anticip   the feder reserv is in a veri differ place relat to our democrat elect repres than a lot of other central bank   we report to the congress   we don   t have a minist of financ or a chancellor of the exchequ that interced between us and the congress   the congress has given us goal in word and not in number  fortun   i wouldn   t want them to give us goal in number  there were some number in the humphrey hawkin act  which on the unemploy rate were potenti quit damag if we had gone for them   they haven   t ask us to put number on these goal   they haven   t look at this for ten year  but in the mid      s when the senat look at this  they didn   t go anywher with it   they reject it   so i think we are out in front by do this   if there were to be a backlash against even this limit step  then at least we wouldn   t have commit to someth that might provok a bigger backlash   so i see this as a step toward possibl specifi price stabil numer  a step that help to manag the risk that it might provok some reaction that we would have troubl live with   so i   m veri strong in support of the path you outlin  i think the subcommitte need from the rest of the committe some answer even befor we get to the specif here   so  do you agre that we ought to proceed with an enhanc project process like the one we   ve been go through the past two  e  we might have some specif   should we do it four  e a year   i think we should  but not everybodi might   are we do approxim the right variabl  note that we   ll have to adjust our price variabl   i agre with you  mr  chairman  that ad total inflat to the core is a veri good idea  and we ought to use the same index for both of those  whatev it might happen to be   so we   ll do some adjust  do you agre that there ought to be a write up of these project more or less like the one that the staff has produc  approv by the fomc so that it is an fomc document  and releas to the public   now  we might discuss exact what   s in that document   like you  mr  chairman  i kind of like the histogram of how mani peopl were line up at the particular answer to give a sens of the dispers of view on the committe  they are much easier for me to look at than the central tendenc and the broad rang thing  but not everybodi might agre   so i think there are some question even befor we get to    are you satisfi with the general thrust of where we   re go      i think that   s what we realli  realli need to know more than other thing  let me address some of the thing in exhibit     i like the share of forecast submiss anonym   i guess i   m concern that if it was by name  it would potenti be harder to chang your mind at the meet   it would put pressur on those submit to have more elabor submiss   my sens was that i got the inform that was import to me about where peopl general were   i thought the way we provid inform on the feder fund rate path was use as well   we need to recogn that as we go forward with this   i hope we go forward with this   there will be public pressur on us to releas the under feder fund rate path   i think we need to go into this with our eye open   that pressur will be there  but we need to resist that pressur  the process that we use last  e work pretti well   but let   s be awar that there are risk associ with releas what we think is the path of the feder fund rate go forward  some central bank are do that now  small central bank or small countri in the north and the south  in the antipod and up in scandinavia   let them experi with this for a while and see how the market react and how that interfac with their own decisionmak process befor we go down that path  i also like the chang in character uncertainti in the risk around the forecast  that is  here   s a tabl   includ that tabl   how do you feel relat to that tabl   i think the tabl will help the public understand how littl we know about the macroeconomi   laughter   one thing that concern me about the project process and deliv these thing is the decim point   to the right of the decim point   there   s a bit of a risk that we would be perceiv as know that there   s some differ between     and     percent inflat   that we can realli determin it   and i think that includ the tabl will tell peopl that   s not realli the case   so i think it is import that the tabl be in there  regard in what form the project should be releas  your thought for two  e in an enhanc monetari polici report   in februari and juli   and two other  e   either in the minut or in a separ document releas around or just befor the minut  but realli just be that enhanc write up   strike me as right   so two updat that are veri compress and not much more than what we agre on and then the two monetari polici report in which they would be embed strike me as the right way to go  in term of final the project  as i think   note  i   m of the view that we shouldn   t be updat our project except from what we hear at this meet   the project we releas are how we explain what we did  whi we did it  and when we sat around this tabl  how we saw the path forward that influenc our decis   as for inform that come in after we leav this tabl  we will not have had an opportun to digest it or to discuss it and it implic among ourselv   so  yes  if we want to updat our project after the meet  i would have a veri narrow window  and the updat would be base on the inform you heard at the meet  in term of the minut  as indic by my question to vinc  as a general principl i   d like to shorten the  e befor they come out   presid pool  i can   t speak to a specif advantag of dodg one piec of data or anoth  but the minut are a veri good  nuanc view of what we discuss and whi we made the decis   i found it alway veri help to have them out there when i give a speech or answer question  particular when i answer question from the audienc and i can   t control what i   m say    laughter   right  freudian slip   let   s see   we   ll clean that one up in the transcript    laughter   i think the sooner we get the minut out there the more help they will be for the public and for all of us who are out in the public  but we can   t put so much pressur on this process that we don   t have an appropri review   the word will be even more import  particular four  e a year   i   m not quit sure how all of this fit togeth with your tes oni and all that  but if we can  i think we ought to shorten the  e   i think the minut have approxim the right level of detail in them now   some central bank give much more detail about what one view was and anoth view was and what one person said and anoth person said  but with nineteen peopl sit around the tabl  that would be imposs   so i think we   re there  also i like the idea that presid pool suggest a coupl of year ago and i think   did as well  of take that stuff about the past  the first eight page or so through the staff forecast and make that a staff document   so we could say     as background for the meet  the staff prepar or suppli the committe with the follow inform     howev they want to do it   if they want to make it part  book or whatev  it is their thing   at the least  that take it out of our hand   it help us with the edit process   it help them with the edit process   so i think that would be a help innov   thank you   i am sorri to have gone on so long
that   s okay   thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   we were ask to comment on a long list of question concern econom project  the minut  and the statement   in addit  governor kohn has put out the broader question of the general thrust of the direct we   re go in  and i   d like to focus my remark on the latter   frank  right now i think the most import question regard the releas of our project concern the relationship of these communic devic to our inflat object   everyth els is more or less small potato right now   i believ it would be a mistak to releas our project without agre on it and communic a committe inflat object   it   s inevit  in fact  it   s intend the way you describ it  mr  chairman  that particip    third year inflat project will be interpret as the equival of an object   i think this would be problemat without an explicit statement of an object for a number of reason  first  our project display a nontrivi dispers  admit a narrow rang  but market particip are go to have a keen interest in whether we believ a     percent inflat rate  say  is too high or just about right   financi market particip alreadi believ that there   s a dispers of the committe member    prefer inflat rate and that it lie between     and   percent   i note that show that everi individu prefer inflat rate span a rang of     to   percent is not equival to the committe   s decid that it collect prefer inflat rate is for anyth within a band of     to   percent  so i don   t think this is go to enhanc the clariti of the public   s understand of our intent much at all  second  communic our inflat object via three year out project would accomplish littl by way of enhanc ani commit sinc we   d releas the project anew three or four  e a year with the implic that our impli object could chang over  e   i   ll remind you again about my brother in law do retir benefit project  just to make the import point that a signific part of the valu of an announc object is to reduc long run uncertainti about inflat  third  our inflat project would be display alongsid exact analog project for unemploy and gdp growth in an exact analog way   this would confus peopl about the econom of monetari polici   in that context  how do we convey that we do not have numer target for unemploy or growth   how do we convey that inflat is a variabl that we control in the medium and long run  but we cannot peg growth or unemploy at ani one number in a sustain way   in other word  how do we remind peopl that the long run phillip curv is virtual vertic   a relat consider is that  if we present our project this way and do not clear state our inflat object  it   s not hard to imagin someon in the congress tri to hold us as account for our unemploy project as for our inflat project   this would be a dramat step backward for us  i think  fourth  and probabl the most press and immedi problem in my view  publish our project this way will do noth to improv the clariti of our intern deliber or to allevi the problem we have and will continu to have in write statement in the absenc of an agre upon object  for these reason  i believ that the releas of econom project contain particip    forecast for inflat three year out would be a poor and ineffect substitut for an explicit articul object and would be problemat without such an object  now  let me be clear   i do think we should move ahead in this direct  and i applaud your leadership  mr  chairman  for put someth on the tabl today at the outset of the discuss   i just think we should do this in conjunct with the inevit other step of agre on what we   re about here in the committe   i can appreci the sensit to the likelihood that various politician may react to our communic of an explicit numer object  but over the past thirti year  politician have react to mani of our action that were integr to our success over that period   we should decid honest what we believ is best for the countri and communic it clear and with confid   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
mr  chairman  may i
i   m sorri   vice chairman
so  presid    is it your view that if we   re not at this point prepar to announc a quantit definit of the committe   s long term object  that we should not do a third year project
thank you  mr  chairman   i veri much support the propos that you   ve outlin here   i think it   not tie our hand as individu  which was one of my concern origin   it allow us to do our work as member of this committe and to put our inform out there for our colleagu and for the public to judg  and i think that   s veri import as individu on the committe   i think that the third year project are help   they do take on the tone of a goal   there   s no question about that  but i don   t think that it   s necessarili bad at all for us as individu  and i don   t necessarili think the fact that we have differ is bad for us as a committe so long as we   re clear about our analysi for that   so i   m veri support of that  i would move the minut up if at all possibl   i think they have serv us well   we still work veri hard on the statement  but the minut have de emphas the import of the statement becaus they clarifi  and the sooner you can clarifi through the minut  the better the public is serv   so  yes  we should proceed   i like four  e a year   now  how do we do it in term of the descript and so forth   that   s someth i think we   ll experi with over  e   i realli do like the histogram   i think they give a veri clear piec of inform to the public and to each of us   so i   m veri support of them as well  the variabl you have are just about right   i prefer the cpi  as i have in the past  but i certain wouldn   t fall on my sword about it   i think get this out is more import than whether we do the cpi or the pce   i do think total inflat is veri import   it help clarifi thing for the public and allow us to explain the differ between it and core   if i had my choic  i   d stay away from the fed fund rate path   appropri polici or the way you have describ it is fine   use uncertainti in explain it is extrem import becaus it is an uncertain busi over  e  i would not have revis  they distort what we had come in   the minut should describ part of the discuss and clarifi thing for us as we go through it   so redo the project afterward serv no real use purpos to my mind   i think we should move forward on this as you   ve describ it here   i like your summari of what do it accomplish   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  want to thank you for put this propos on the tabl   i think it will help this discuss  and i find myself agre with everyth you recommend actual   i   m a littl frustrat   i can   t find anyth to disagre with    laughter   but let me mention a few nuanc   on the question of whether it is help to do this in the absenc of a quantit inflat object  i think that on balanc it is   it   move the ball forward   in line with bill pool   s question earlier  it   s an increment step  but a veri signific increment step forward and one that on balanc will help provid more inform   if at some point in the futur the committe decid to have a quantit object  it would be an import part of that process   in ani case  you   d have to do it as well  on the question that don kohn ask us to comment on specif  i think that  yes  we should proceed with the enhanc project and four  e a year is a good way to do it   i like the total inflat approach  look at it on a long term basi  becaus it clarifi the confus between core and total  and over  e they should clear be the same   regard the write up  my recommend is to put it as an appendix to the minut to keep it as simpl as possibl   i think that put it as an appendix simplifi it becaus then you can just lift it out and use it those two  e a year for the monetari polici report  and it just elimin ani possibl of confus between the two   if the  e of your tes oni befor the congress is such that you need an expedit process for that appendix  it   s easier to do it that way   it just simplifi it for everyon  and there   s just less risk of confus   i think it would be easier for the staff as well  i like the idea of the three to five year  by the way  for the longer term   that is help in term of explain this to the public   i know some peopl are concern that it rais question about what potenti output is and so on  but you   re give a rang  and i think it help just to explain the complex of this   have the longer term period would be help as well  get back to vinc   s specif question here   should we share them   yes   i like the way you   ve use the fed fund rate path  and i like the uncertainti and risk   about final project  i agre complet with what don said   the inform should be what we have in hand at the  e of the meet becaus we all should have the same cutoff point for the project  and that   s the logic cutoff point  and then mayb give peopl a day or two to updat them or modifi them base on what they heard at the meet   but it should be a veri clear cutoff   the day of the meet  about expedit the minut  i guess i would have one disagr here   i disagre with don on this   the benefit of expedit them would be veri minor compar with the potenti cost in term of addit staff resourc that would be need   i think we have it just about right now   again  if you shorten the schedul  you can   t lengthen it again   so i would just keep it where it is now  i just mention one other littl aspect  and that relat to the histogram   i agre we should use them   they will show the outlier in the project  which is fine   again  use them show the divers of view   there is a risk here that some of the outlier may over  e want to move more to the center  but so be it   i don   t think that is a great risk  but i think it is someth we should recogn might occur here   so on balanc  i think the propos you have put forth is veri  veri good  and i agre complet with it
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i  like presid    find it veri difficult to find ani disagr with what you propos   i   m veri support of the approach you   ve laid out for the reason that you articul so clear   i support extend the forecast period   you mention go to a third year  you also suggest mayb a three to five year averag   i   m lean toward the three to five year averag becaus i had propos a five year extens of the forecast period   the two year that we current use and then ad the fifth year   but your three to five year averag make perfect sens to me  i   m veri support of use a total inflat number   presid hoenig mention that he had a prefer for the total cpi and so do i for the reason that you mention   it   s a measur that the public current understand  and it get a lot of public   but as you point out  if we start use the pce deflat  the public will start to focus on that measur   i like the approach of have quarter releas of our project   that seem appropri  last year we saw that when we releas our forecast onli twice a year  they can becom outdat rather quick   so give more inform on a quarter basi would allow us to keep our forecast more current   i would like us to spend more  e talk about whether we assum an op  polici becaus  as governor kohn point out  we   re go to get pressur to releas our fed fund rate path becaus peopl are go to want more clarif of what we mean by    appropri    monetari polici or    op     monetari polici   final  i like the fact that your approach retain the current structur of the feder reserv system and allow us to give our own forecast  let the public see the divers of opinion around that forecast   we are go to have to discuss when it will be appropri for us to talk about our individu forecast becaus  onc we start to give the public more inform about the committe   s view on certain thing  the public will want to find out where the differ are   then we will have to have some agreement about whether it   s appropri to talk individu about how we see our differ from the committe   but these are detail that we can talk about with more  e   in general  i   m veri support of the approach that you   ve laid out today  i know we   ve been ask to answer some of     s question and respond to some propos that governor kohn put out  and i   ll just make a few comment   i do want to proceed with the project   i mention that quarter would be fine   regard when the project should be final  i support do it at the end of the week and use the same rule that we use for the minut current   not to bring in new data that we receiv  in term of the benefit and cost of further expedit the minut  i think  like presid    that the benefit are minor compar with some of the cost   the current process is give more  e for member to give thought input into those minut  and i wouldn   t want to chang that   those item complet my comment   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   as some other have said  i want to applaud your leadership in lay out a propos for how we think about this   it   s import to have a framework on the tabl for think about where we want to be   i would add that general i agre with almost everyth you said   i think it   s a good way forward   i view this as a step  not the end game   it   s part of a process in which we evalu what we   re do and how we do it   while i share in principl presid     s concern about the potenti risk associ with do this without agre on explicit object  i   m will to bear those risk becaus  sinc most peopl around this tabl know where i   d like to be in term of that  i think the risk are accept in the short run as a mean of get us to that ul  object   i think that this will help us as a committe becom more comfort with be more transpar and more communic and that the process in itself will help us get to where i think we ought to be   so from that standpoint i   m veri support of this direct   i support go through with it under the guidelin and broad outlin that you describ  as to some of the specif thing that governor kohn mention and we talk about  as i said  i want to proceed   i think four  e a year is right   the detail of the monetari polici report to the congress are just a detail   we can work them out  somebodi is better at figur that out than i am   i think that shouldn   t be consid a stumbl block   i support move to total inflat   as i said both ye day and earlier today  i think that   s import   i   m margin indiffer between total pce and total cpi  earlier i had advoc the cpi   i   m still perhap at the margin  but to me that   s not a big issu one way or the other   i agre on the  e   the forecast and the project ought to be base on inform avail at the meet  not subsequ inform   in fact  that   s veri import in what we   re tri to communic about our decisionmak process   i   m fair happi with the way the staff has craft the languag   i think they have done a pretti good job of captur the sens   i   m rather indiffer about whether we incorpor it into the minut direct or we make it an addendum   again  i think the market and this group can live with it either way  and peopl who read the minut will come to understand and accept it one way or anoth  the two point with which i have some troubl or perhap a littl disagr with governor kohn   s comment concern the op  polici and whether we reveal what   s implicit in the fed fund rate forecast go forward   i think that reveal a dispers or the vari under polici assumpt that peopl are use go forward help on the issu of uncertainti   that the world is uncertain and that our understand of the way the macroeconomi work is uncertain   by reveal that some under set of assumpt that we on the committe are make to get to this set of object are differ could actual be veri help in reinforc the view that the futur is uncertain   therefor  rather than lock us into some path  it may end up  in fact  open up option to us in a way that we might not have had befor   so i think there   s actual potenti inform there that we   re provid to the marketplac that may be valuabl   give this area a bit more thought might be worthwhil  the second point is one that presid pianalto just mention  and it just occur to me after she mention it   i realiz that  if we submit these forecast anonym and if they   re report anonym  even though the dispers and so forth are report in the minut  we as presid and as board member are out give speech all the  e about our outlook for the economi   at the end of the day  we are unlik to stop give out inform about what our view are   it   s a littl like hide it over here  but everybodi is out talk about what their view is anyway   so i   m not sure we are buy anyth real by be anonym about our forecast   i guess i   m in favor of reveal more rather than less   reveal more about our uncertainti or our assumpt under the futur path of the fed fund rate and have that inform convey some uncertainti   and be more transpar  becaus we are anyway  about what our individu forecast may have been in talk about that outlook   thank you
thank you   vice chairman
may i ask a clarifi question befor i speak
this realli goe to the remark of presid   and to the relationship between a narrat to accompani the project and the descript in the minut   if you did that model  which as i understood it  presid    is to incorpor a narrat as an appendix to the minut  how then would the descript of the outlook that is in the minut now   the narrat descript of the central tendenc of the committe that now goe in the minut   relat to the narrat descript about the project   what would be the relationship be between those two thing  if you did them as separ but link document
obvious  the two would have to be draft veri care to make sure that they are in concert and that there are no inconsist in them   but i think do so is clear manag becaus one is a set of longer term project and the other is a discuss of the shorter term outlook
so that is the distinct   you would say the minut are the descript of the near term outlook that underpin our judgment about the decis at the meet  and the annex would be more of a focus on the descript of the medium term
yes  whatev the  efram is for the project
isn   t there a third altern   the minut are what we actual discuss  and the other thing is a stori   i think presid     s question realli relat to whether or not we are go to tri to weav what we actual discuss into some coher stori or tri to make the minut realli be what i suspect they were origin intend to be  which is what the color and commentari of our discuss were
i think i would just note  vice chairman    that jim clous wrote a version of the minut that did a pretti good job of integr them   it gave the project with the long term overview and the under forc  et cetera  and then the rest of the minut  as is our wont  in sort of a sector by sector discuss of most develop in the near term   but you rais a good question   i think we should keep that in mind
mr  chairman  may i ask   was that the draft that ms    sent around
yes  the appendix to       s memo is the draft that jim clous prepar   i think the vice chairman is correct in that  of cours  there would be some repetit in the discuss of the minut just becaus the sector by sector discuss of the near term conjunctur is go to be somewhat similar to the longer term structur of the three year or the three to five year forecast   but they would serv differ purpos  and that repetit might not be unhelp
okay   so  mr  chairman  i am veri support of the path you laid out   i think it basic is the op  balanc today between what the consensus of the committe will bear now on the merit and what our uniqu institut structur as a central bank permit   now  your view and the committe   s view of that balanc may chang over  e  but i think what you describ has to be pretti close to the op  balanc of those need today   what is the object of this exercis   i think i am complet comfort with what you and don said in term of the broad object of what we are tri to achiev through these enhanc project  but i think fundament that it is import to recogn that we are not princip tri to give a lot of detail about dispers and varianc within the committe   what we should tri to do most is to give more textur around the central tendenc view of the committe about the like evolut  the desir evolut  of the economi over a two to three year  mayb longer  period so that peopl have a better sens of what inform our basic judgment about the appropri stanc of monetari polici   we should make sure that we keep to that object as we think about what to put into a propos regard enhanc project  on the specif  i am fine with a third year   i would like to discuss a littl further the merit of three year versus three to five year   i think the tradeoff between the two are veri interest  and i want to say someth about that in a bit   i am fine with quarter   i agre that we should have project on both headlin and core and that they should be base on the same index  not differ index   befor we decid to go to pce and core pce  again  we should discuss how to think about what it will be like to live in a world where we still have tip pay the cpi   we still have a whole bunch of survey base measur report the cpi   if we   re go to give a lot more emphasi to the medium term implicit object of the committe in some quantit sens like this  we should think through whether it will work or be comfort over  e   i agre that this should be done on a view of op  polici that is undisclos for the reason that have been put in favor of that  although i think presid   did a nice job of explain the altern view  i would also be in favor of expedit the minut on the ground that i think there is a lot of virtu in say that you want to have a short period between what we say about what we did and whi we did it and the greater narrat textur that has to come in the minut   the longer the gap between those two thing is  the greater the risk that you have two event with signal impact on monetari polici rather than one   this is complic to do and must have some cost  but i   d say that a bias toward collaps the two as close as possibl is the right bias  on the third year question  mr  chairman  you talk about how you would describ what peopl should infer from the third year project about the object and prefer of the member of the committe individu   my own bias would be to still tri to qualifi heavili whatev we say about the mean of that third year   if we believ  as you   ve said mani  e i think  that one want to think about the period for bring inflat back down to object as someth that will probabl have to vari base on the circumst  it is realli import not to set up a dynam in which peopl view that third year project as our fix object for that horizon   we want to have a fair amount of flexibl for a view of the appropri path of inflat over  e to chang meet to meet and not be too lock into a judgment about that   so i would say that i am inclin to keep that softer for all the reason the propon of a flexibl horizon have laid out  there is virtu in lay out the central tendenc of the committe   s view about what the appropri path is like to be today  but there may be circumst in which we want to be abov target or object for a longer  e than three year   again  our view about that path might actual vari meet to meet   so i would want to soften that up a littl   but as we elabor the packag and the draft of how this get present  peopl will have a chanc to look at whether the balanc is right  on dispers and what we say about dispers across the committe  i think the histogram have a lot of appeal  and i have been in favor of them and of disclos them in the past   but i am a littl worri about the follow   there is some risk that they are demystifi   either the dispers is go to look too wide  or it is go to get kind of narrow   if we had to decid today  i would be inclin to say for this next step that we should use the narrat descript rather than the histogram to character dispers  one reason is that we don   t have nineteen peopl do independ  fulli fledg  intern consist forecast with a fulli elabor view that is independ of the  book   s view of the structur of the economi and it evolut  we are not like the respond to the survey of profession forecast in some sens  and so to have a histogram present of nineteen differ view with this degre of divers and what goe into that give probabl a bit too much emphasi to the quantit number of the individu view with which peopl come to the tabl   but they are veri appeal as a devic for convey uncertainti  so that   s the virtu   i would say mayb start with tri to put more textur into a narrat descript rather than in a histogram  the issu about the relationship between the narrat descript that would accompani the project and the minut is someth we need to think through more care   i   m still uncomfort in that i think what we want to do is to tri to give peopl a littl more sens of the stori that defin the central tendenc of the committe about the like desir evolut of the economi   of output and inflat   the part of the minut that talk about the outlook shouldn   t be too narrow and shouldn   t be too short in it horizon   in mani way  we are make a broad judgment about the forecast horizon at everi meet   i don   t know what the solut to this is  but i would think through the relationship a bit more care  and my inclin is to go for integr  four  e a year we do minut like today  and four  e a year we do someth that has more textur  more detail  and a littl bit more on the medium term and has some tabl accompani it   again  what we should tri to do is give peopl more of a sens of the view of the central tendenc of the committe that inform that judgment about the appropri stanc of monetari polici over  e   to view them as separ  distinguish thing leav me slight uncomfort  so i think the topic deserv some more thought  on  e  mr  chairman  in term of it launch in octob versus januari  i think we should defer to your basic judgment about what make sens   my view is that you should set a dynam in motion now that give you the option of do it in octob if peopl are comfort enough by that  e and if it look as though the state of the world at that point would be conduc to this kind of announc   but i think that you want to make sure befor we go forward that you have a good sens of how we   re go to describ this  what it   s realli go to mean  and how we handl all the obvious complic question that we   re go to get  is this enough   will it leav us with an unmanag set of problem intern in how we think about decis on monetari polici or extern in term of the ambigu it still leav in the market about what our object is   let me just say a few thing about that   i don   t think it is right to say that the market is fixat particular on the question about whether our implicit view about what we   d like to see inflat do over  e is            or     i think what the market want  realli  more than anyth is to know what we are go to do with the fed fund rate  laughter  at the next meet  the meet after that  and the meet after that   they would like to know more about what we think about the economi  but realli what they want to know is what we are go to do with monetari polici tomorrow   it is veri import   as you read that peopl complain about the ambigu we live with today  have live with for sever decad  and are like to live with in the futur about what we are go to do to inflat over  e   to rememb that what they want to know is what we are go to do with the fed fund rate tomorrow   my own sens is we can manag  as we have manag in the past  with a framework that leav the present degre of ambigu about our object unresolv   there is a lot of valu and flexibl in that ambigu   i don   t view it as a particular vice   i don   t think that there is ani compel evid to support the view that the burden that ambigu present today is unmanag   certain not relat to the past two decad   of cours  we can evolv further   as the chairman said  we should view this as an evolutionari process   we should be prepar to revisit over  e each judgment we make and to continu to explor whether there are thing we can do beyond this to improv the way monetari polici work in the unit state   so i think it   s not right to think about this as the begin with a clear evolut for someth beyond this   it is also not right to view this as the end   i think you should view it as this is what is next  and we   ll continu to think through thing that might help us do monetari polici better over  e   that   s all i   ve got
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i  too  would like to thank you veri much for present your thought at the begin of this discuss   it was extrem help to my think through what comment i want to make at this meet   i have also found governor kohn  vice chairman    and everybodi els who has talk veri help in think through some of these issu  i am veri much in favor of the forecast process that we are work on   i don   t think we have it total right yet  but i think we   re head in the right direct   it   s a great balanc becaus  as oppos to establish right now an inflat object that would sit out there for all  e   mayb that   s the direct in which you want to head in the futur   it character over a longish term   and i am attract more to three year than to three to five year   how we see the balanc of thing work out in the economi and what we think it is possibl to do with our inflat object over that period  given the other factor that we need to think about in the economi and that are import  both to us and to everybodi within our economi   so use these forecast and put a third year out there that describ what the balanc of thing would be given an appropri polici path is someth with which i could be veri comfort  i like the way that vice chairman   talk about begin and end  one thing that i   ve been struck by in this whole communic process is how hard it is to move backward onc one start to do someth   it is near imposs to take it away   so as we think about begin and end  we need to be veri care about take a step at a  e   even though it might seem reason to take five step  we should tri one  see how it work  and then move on from there   give a forecast four  e a year  go to three year  not three to five  and show the balanc of thing and the rang in which the committe would see those thing turn out would be  i would say in harmoni with vice chairman       a good step     i agre with four  e a year   that   s a good frequenc   i was kind of drawn to some of vice chairman     s thought about whether or not to integr this with the minut   i came into the meet think that it would be better as a separ document append to the minut that  if the  e work out well  could be put into the monetari polici report or could stand on it own   i tend to think of the minut as a discuss of what happen at the meet  focus on what we use to think of as the forese futur  which never was three year   it was alway two or three meet ahead  shape the stanc of polici over the near term   so i was on the same wavelength as presid     the minut describ a set of circumst around which one is shape current polici   of cours  they are relat to the longer run  but that is a stori that can be told somewhat independ and might be told better independ than woven into the minut   but i think there is a need to think more about that   vice chairman   had some interest thought  i think anonym is use at this  e   again  i am think that  onc one take a step forward  it   s hard to go back   i like the histogram myself   they are person inform   howev  i think if we accompani at least the first round of these forecast with histogram  it will be somewhat like throw red meat at a tiger   we have had those bore tabl in the monetari polici report for thirti year    laughter   you know  the varianc in the rang  the outlier   they have been there the whole  e   the market could have made a lot out of that  but it never did  not too much anyway   i think that we might be better off with a more bore approach as a first step into this four  e a year   say we did it  write what it was about  give the tabl  but don   t give all these red histogram that seem to beg everybodi to worri about the outlier   i don   t think that is go to be help to us in term of discuss thing  i know we are probabl run short of  e  and i can   t go through all these question in the same amount of detail   let   s see  on that basi  i think that we should go forward four  e a year and forecast a three year  e horizon   i like the idea of total inflat   everi  e we have talk about this i thought that  if we are go to set a target  it should be in term of a longish term in total inflat   i would be more inclin to the cpi   i should mention that i heard your comment that  if we focus on pce  sooner or later everybodi els will   that   s what we thought about ten year ago when we start talk about pce  and over  e peopl haven   t   pce is there  but the cpi still is veri  veri common in term of how peopl talk about inflat and the economi  and thing are still link to the cpi   i do think that we need to give a littl more thought to either the cpi or pce  and look at the total as well as the core is veri valuabl   i don   t think that we should updat our forecast on anyth other than what we heard at the meet  there haven   t been mani updat in the past   i wouldn   t expect there to be that mani in the futur  so i would think either the same day of the meet  the next day  or the follow friday  depend on when the day of the meet is   fine  give peopl  e to updat their forecast base on what they heard at the meet but not on new data that are out there  okay   let me see if there   s anyth els   in term of the benefit and cost of further expedit the minut  i agre that there would definit be cost to do so  there may  howev  be a benefit in that we might be abl to get to the object that we initi had of tri to make the statement after the meet more streamlin   to me  that would be a signific benefit of expedit the minut   we could focus the statement on what we did and whi we did it and not tri to make that a vehicl for some longer term refer  but rather leav that to the minut and then four  e a year to the forecast   so i think there is a benefit to expedit the minut   from a process point of view  peopl have to be abl to get encrypt inform on their blackberri and not be forc to carri their laptop with them everi singl place they go   if we expedit the minut  that will becom even more of a burden  i think   in a memo  vinc talk about deleg approv   i would not do that   the princip have to be the one to approv the minut   if we decid to expedit them  we have to facilit that process so that the princip can weigh in in a  e way on the minut   did i miss someth that somebodi want to hear about
the yanke    laughter
probabl not   okay   that   s it
we   ll ring you up in retir    laughter
how about the red sox
my predict is that they will stay in first place through the all star break    laughter   i think that   s safe enough
thank   i also want to say that i am veri support of what the chairman and the vice chairman said   i realli think this thread the needl for get  as vice chairman   said  the right balanc   we get to provid more inform with greater clariti and greater account  and i think it will also lead to greater credibl without be perceiv as inflex or challeng the dual mandat  some of the question and concern that i rais in my intervent earlier indic that i was support of an inflat goal  but i said it was a close call   for me  this is not a close call   it realli address a lot of the potenti concern that i had   i also think it   s extrem good in put us on the proper evolutionari path   as you well know  everyth at the fed move at a pace that is like to be measur  laughter   and so this should oper on that same pace   it allow us to understand how the new number will be perceiv   as a number of peopl said  it is veri hard to move back  but this give us some experiment and a clear movement forward   it allow us to think about appropri risk manag  as the vice chairman said  at least at this stage  particular given that not everyon is on board with a particular number   even if everyon were on board with a particular number  i think a more difficult thing would be that  if you are away from that number  what the right path is to get to it   i actual think that is the most difficult thing to get consensus on   this give us a littl more flexibl on that without make ani particular commit   it provid some credibl without rais someth that could potenti be more problemat   also  it allow us to harden this if we so choos   if we   re find that we   re not get the credibl benefit that we might hope from this  we can go forward  on the specif  i think there is consensus on mani of the thing that have been said  so i won   t go through the individu piec   just let me mention a coupl of thing  actual  along the line of what the chairman said about focus on pce and the endogen respons that there will be more focus on it   i think that is  to some extent  correct   i also think that there may be some issu on exist contract  and so it is an import point to think about  the point that presid   rais is also an import one to think about  how are these differ number go to be perceiv   obvious  we are focus a lot on the particular number for inflat  but we are put these other number out in the same format in the same way   this rais question about growth goal  employ goal  the nairu  and phillip curv tradeoff  about which we certain   or at least i certain   wouldn   t feel comfort in make commit   that actual lead me to desir to put out just a third year forecast rather than a three to five year forecast  at least at this point becaus i think it reduc the chanc of mispercept and allow for greater flexibl of how we want to character it   it allow us to go forward and character it more as a goal  if we so choos and there isn   t confus   but if we say three to five year  it is hard to step away from that be a particular goal   i am not say that we don   t want to do that down the line   but at this stage i think i   d feel a bit more comfort in stick with the pace that is like to be measur and just ad a year on that  again  on this endogen respons  if we do this quarter  we are like to generat a request for quarter tes oni from the chairman  and that respons becom more and more like the more independ we make this document   i   m not say that anyth is wrong with that  but i think we should just be awar of it   the chairman should be awar of what he is get himself into  laughter  and make sure that he feel comfort with that  although i don   t see ani problem with it   i just think that it is import to think about   with respect to the question about whether or not it should be anonym  i think it is valuabl to have the project out there but to have them be anonym   the main reason for anonym is  as you well know  that a report will ask     don   t you think that presid x is complet wrong      talk about red meat in front of a tiger   that is exact what peopl like to look for   they like to look for dissent   although there could be some benefit  i see attribut as most a downsid   tri to generat dissent among peopl  which i think is not particular product  i do broad like the idea of expedit the minut   get inform to the market sooner and when it is fresher is more valuabl   but i am sensit to concern about the downsid risk of peopl be unabl to weigh in and of excess burden on the staff   so we have to get that balanc right   but all other thing be equal  i prefer sooner rather than later   make sure that we are avail to give feedback or can get minut secur in a more expedit process is a relat small price for the nineteen of us to pay to provid fresher inform to the public   with that  i would also say that we shouldn   t revis our project beyond the day of the meet becaus the minut should be about the meet   they shouldn   t step on or confus thing  and expedit them make that kind of revis even more sensibl   so i am veri much on board with this type of propos   thank
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  you spoke of the road to damascus   i was think about the movi    what about bob       not becaus of my own neuros about this exercis but becaus i think it is import to proceed with babi step  step by step  presid     s point is cardin   it   s veri hard to go back onc you move forward  as i wrote in my memo of june    i believ it was  i think that you have summar one of the most import thing that we can do as a committe  and that is to get a use and credibl inflat metric   not onli do i applaud the overal outlin that you start us off with   and  again  thank you for bring that outlin to the tabl becaus it organ the convers   but also i am a big believ in the need for us to come up with an inflat metric that is credibl       s point on the pce versus the cpi is veri import to consid   as i have said befor  i am more in favor of the cpi  but i do think we need to think that decis through in term of the differ instrument that are out there in the market and the preced that has been set  now  i just want to make a coupl of point   on the road to damascus  we have to think of what the mileston are go to be   i want to be care that we don   t labor under a conceit of fals precis   i worri some  that  when we look at these histogram   and i want to come back to the histogram in a second   the realiti is that onli    basi point separ these thing   the further we go out in the  e horizon   you know the old say that you onli put someth three point to the right of the decim point to show that you have a sens of humor   we have to be veri  veri care not to impli that we have ultra precis   we don   t have ultra precis  this is a judgment busi   so that is one point i would like to make  i have veri mix feel about the histogram   after listen to this convers  i would suggest that we start with the central tendenc analysi   the tabl that was put togeth   the problem with histogram  besid give us a sens of fals precis  is someth that a coupl of the presid and governor point out or hint at and governor   just point to but i thought that he didn   t go far enough   even if we do it anonym  if we were to publish these  the press is go to poke and poke and poke   the red meat argument that presid   gave   and ask     who are the outlier  and whi      onc the press start do this  it is just a matter of  e befor a congresswoman or a congressman   the same thing   we row as a crew  as a team  and i want to be veri care that we don   t take ani risk to undermin the uniqu aspect of this bodi   we sit around this tabl   we have differ of opinion   i notic governor   point to me when he said     this guy is wrong      it was just the way you were point    laughter   i realiz that some  i am a total outlier here  but that is in the spirit of the comradeship that exist at this tabl   you put this out for the public  and i think you run certain risk of undermin the author of this committe  the author of the chairman  and the integr of the process   the federalist process that we have is of valu   let   s be care that we preserv it and don   t make this like everi other washington institut  becaus we are uniqu in the natur of our integr  just a coupl of other comment   i   m veri wari  as i outlin in my letter  of be open about the fed fund rate path we envis   this is our central policymak instrument   if we were to forecast it  i worri that we are go down a slipperi slope  we would be under pressur to valid our forecast by our action  and i think we need to preserv some of the my i that surround them   i remind you that ff   stand for    full frontal     so i want to be care  again  not to give the market a full frontal view but to preserv some of our power  with regard to the frequenc with which we do this exercis   again  if we do it babi step by babi step  i would like the governor to be mind of the fact that the presid run busi   we have other thing to do   i think vice chairman   point to that indirect   this is not the onli thing we do   we don   t have our own model   if governor kohn and the bank affair committe are will to give us a few billion dollar more to build our own model  then we are happi to take the money   laughter   but the realism is that we key off the staff and off the frb us model   if you realli look at all these number that were given out  not a whole lot of variat is there  we need to acknowledg the fact that we don   t have the wherewith and that a lot of this is guesswork   the further we go out  the more it is guesswork  one last point   i like your suggest  mr  chairman  of the three to five year  as i have made clear  i have the opposit fear of presid     s   i think that what presid   suggest put us right into an argument with the polit author about what our employ target is   this is a nice way to skirt the issu of formal inflat target and  in my view  inevit be forc by the congress into employ target   i support your suggest that we use a three to five year rang  it is a nice  eleg way to get us out of a possibl box   yet if we decid to go down that road in the futur   again  in this    what about bob     babi step approach   we can do that later   i wouldn   t start out there   i think there are too mani risk   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   clear  from the discuss so far   and my predict is that it will continu this way   there is a tremend amount of support for the outlin that you have present  and i share that   i want to focus on two point that   rais and mayb hit them a littl harder   first  on the fed fund path  the fed fund rate is the polici instrument   we don   t want to confus the public about the differ between the polici instrument and the polici goal   if we want to present someth  we ought to present the polici rule by which the fed fund rate is determin  we don   t know how to do that beyond the broad outlin of the taylor rule  and that is the point that we should be emphas   so i am veri oppos to present a fed fund rate path becaus i think it is realli go to confus our communic  now  on the issu of fals precis  i want to use an analog becaus i hope that it will help to explain this issu   let me use a gps analog   if i did my calcul correct  gps coordin usual show up on your instrument down to a thousandth of a minut of longitud  let   s say   if i did my calcul correct  that   s about six feet   for some polici purpos  perhap locat the pier on a suspens bridg  you would realli like anoth digit   but the gps instrument can   t produc that other digit   if you were to tri to do it with repeat trial  you would just get random garbag  therefor  if you are locat bridg pier  you have to use a differ measur devic   now  don said     what is the differ between     and          well  that is beyond the measur accuraci of a lot of the data   it is not just that it  sn   t have veri much polici relev  but it is realli beyond the measur accuraci  and we have multipl measur of inflat   we take the pce index  and we look at it with and without the nonmarket compon   those relationship chang  and therefor we are realli make a mistak if we forc ourselv to make these judgment to     percentag point   in the project  we ought to round these thing off to the appropri number of signific digit   standard scientif practic is not to present measur that run beyond the accuraci of the measur instrument   so what is the appropri number of signific digit in this busi   if you look at the natur of the revis  the multipl measur  and so forth  i would propos that for gdp and inflat it is probabl     percentag point   for the unemploy rate  it is mayb      percentag point   but we are realli go to tie ourselv in knot over stuff that is like the fourth digit on your gps instrument   it just  sn   t have ani measur valid to it  part of the problem in present the histogram that are organ around these veri fine interv is that they will display differ that are total insignific and don   t amount to anyth   but if we present it  peopl will start think that we must think it mean someth   so i think we realli will aggrav the communic process  and therefor we ought to look at what the appropri number of signific digit is   i am not tri to obfusc the differ   i am tri to make sure that we focus on differ that are genuin   if we have a real differ that is     percentag point apart  well so be it   there is no reason in my view that we shouldn   t present it and explain it
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i strong support the propos that you have laid out   i appreci your do so   they have help focus this discuss  besid agre with the propos  i also agre with the reason that you have set out as to whi this is the right step and whi it is an import step   it  sn   t go all the way to have a singl agre upon inflat object  but i do think it   s a major step in that direct   given the polit realiti and sensit and the differ of opinion and comfort level with move wholli in that direct  i think this is a veri construct step   it move us forward  and it  sn   t preclud other measur step later on   it would worri me to take this step if there were a huge differ among us about the quantit definit of an appropri price stabil object   but it is clear that the rang of differ is not veri broad      to   in the grand scheme of thing seem to me to be veri minor   certain  at this point go out to a third year  it seem to me  will be veri inform to the public  i realli like the idea that  have talk about our individu comfort zone  we will be abl to get out of the current phase of be veri reluct to talk about this topic at all   it would be good to express in our own speech someth that reflect a committe object   i think that     to   as a rang of what we think of as price stabil is adequ and will be use   it will let us clear explain our object and our strategi for use monetari polici to achiev them  which is someth we realli haven   t done much of  and i think that   s a good thing to do  i am realli torn about your propos about whether or not we should go beyond three year   we are lucki at this point that we are aw close to the rang that we think we would like to be in   but if at some futur date we were a lot further from the object  i could easili imagin   given my own view of the tradeoff between the employ and inflat goal   that three year would be an insuffici period for you to look at my project and see what my view of price stabil was   so at some futur date  have a rang as short as that could be problemat   howev  go from three to five year has a disadvantag in that we will  in effect  be lay out someth that the congress is like to view as an employ goal or an unemploy goal  and i am worri about take that step   so i am realli torn about it  just a bit on a few specif   i think that four  e a year is appropri   i like our share our project among the committe member  it has been help in understand what other peopl think and in facilit our own discuss   i think the staff has done a wonder job of produc the narrat   a major thing that we can provid to the public is to lay out our reason about the economi   it is be nice done  and i think we realli have that in good shape   i like the idea of a total inflat number   i like the cpi becaus of it familiar but could certain live with the pce as well   i like    appropri polici      there have been a lot of concern in the committe about project the fed fund rate   in the past i have been where presid   is now in term of want to reveal that to the public  but mani good reason have been advanc in our discuss about whi we shouldn   t do that  at least for now   with respect to the concern that  if we are veri specif in our own submiss  it will eventu becom public  my own feel is that  in this round  just ask peopl    do you agre with  book     or    are there ani signific differ     has been quit inform and is suffici  i like the treatment of uncertainti in this round   ask peopl to put down their own number was fals precis   i realli didn   t like that   provid some tabl of model base or forecast base histor averag is veri help if combin with some qualit discuss   i am a littl worri about the histogram   they are nice graphic devic   but are they realli inform about someth we want to inform the public about   i share some of the concern that have been express about outlier and whether or not we want to focus attent on them   with respect to  e of the forecast  i realli think we should not be ad inform in those project that goe beyond what we had at the meet   it will be veri confus if we tri to do so   i feel that we should have the project final either on the day of the fomc meet or short thereaft but not base on ani addit inform  with respect to public  i agre with presid     s thought that put the project out as an appendix to the minut is desir  though we will have to be care about what we say in the discuss   we can then also includ them in the monetari polici report   i do like the idea of expedit the minut  especi if we figur out a way to be abl to read them on our blackberri   we ought to be abl to do that   most of the compress in  e to cut it down to two and a half week come in term of our own respons  e   i think that we can respond quick  especi if we can get them while we   re travel   i like the idea of be abl to use the minut in our speech   we have not yet talk about the statement  but i think get the minut out more quick will also take a littl pressur off the statement   if the staff can find a way to write the first part of the minut and we can present it as the staff   s inform that they brought into the meet  that will also take a burden off the minut  and i hope it will take some burden off the staff
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i also think that your straw man propos realli   strike the right balanc  and i strong support it   we probabl owe it to you between now and the fall  or whenev you feel appropri to be abl to go forward with an announc  to keep our discuss in this room   our confidenti around this discuss for the past year has been incred help  and it   strike me that your abil to frame someth that fair repres your view and our view without have ani of it preview by us  wit or unwit  is aw import  in term of addit reason that i think we have the right balanc in your propos  there has been a discern differ in the market in put data depend into practic   in see how the financi market have react to data set and how they have struggl with what those data have meant  i think that they seem to have come a long way from a year or two year ago in understand how we process data  rather than look at the width and depth of our briefcas or the wink and nod of our statement   i can   t help but think that we have realli made some progress down that path   by put the project first and foremost on our list of deliver to come  we are go to continu to ask them to do their own homework as oppos to reli on us  if we were to go a step or two beyond that at this point  we might undermin some of those good market practic that are start to bear some fruit  the market judg us by our action and not by our word  and that is whi i must say that i don   t think ani of these iter or ani of these propos that we have discuss is a panacea in and of itself   these propos and iter constitut an appropri framework for us to continu our dialogu with the market   by take this next step we are go to put some of our word into action by generat these project quarter and see what respons we get   i tend to think that we are go to learn quit a bit through that process   as other have said  while the econom environ is appar benign  i think that the polit environ and the financi market are probabl somewhat less so   mayb that suggest to me anoth reason for take appropri step and not go beyond them at this point   final  i don   t think the financi market are ask for more than your propos suggest   i think   has it right in some way   they are still just ask for the answer key   what we are do here is final tell them that we are not go to give them the answer key but that we will tell them more about what we   re think   that will be more than suffici to that constitu  and over  e we can revisit what we are do  in term of detail  i will refer to onli three item   first  on whether we should be make our project under appropri polici or share a fed fund rate path  i am incred concern that polici forecast would be misunderstood to be polici commit   again  i think that would undermin much of the good work that we   ve done   second  regard the anonym of project and the point that presid   made  i am a littl uncomfort with even these number of   through    with each of our project becaus i think that the veil that we have around us could well be pierc   anoth way for us to get the benefit of that might be for us to individu submit our project to the staff   then when the staff circul them for us to review  they would have the project aggreg to the extent that we can see granular but not be list as number   through      obvious  that can be done a lot of way   but i am veri concern that  if we were to go with individu project  we would have call and specul that would make us all hunker down and somehow explain whi we are where we are and be somewhat less interest in hear where our colleagu are or in modifi our project over  e   so i would favor even a step back on anonym   but onli enough  obvious  to give us a view of where our colleagu are  third  the question that requir probabl the most  e among the issu that have been rais is the third year versus some three to five year averag   i could chang my view on this  but my instinct is that  if we were to adopt a three to five year window for that set of data  it might look just a littl too cute   i would prefer that we all do our best to say     this is about project      as we get into a third year  our crystal ball are cloudier than they are over shorter period   over  e  if we were to do that with a third year  in our own way and our own speech  we could be elabor on what that third year mean to us   to some of us it might be aspir   to some of us it might be opportunist   but i would hesit to go further than that at this point   but  again  i think this is the right path forward  and obvious discuss will continu   thank you
presid   had an intervent
yes   i just want to make one comment about the issu of the fed fund path   both vice chairman   and governor   made a comment about the market   when i hear you talk about the market  i am struck that it is a veri narrow definit of what the market care about   you are look at it in the context of what the financi market care about is onli what the fund rate is   what our path is go to be  i think that is much too narrow a way to think about what we are tri to do here   to say that they don   t care about inflat and that they care onli about the fund rate is a slipperi slope   whether it is just a financi advis who is worri about inflat plan for his client or peopl who are invest long term and tri to make decis about hous or other thing  i think it   go back to inflat   it is not just about what the market think the fed fund rate is go to be   in that regard   i am go to go out on a limb a bit here   to the extent that longer term decis or the price of longer term asset  such as longer term bond  move frequent with short run fund rate decis   some  more  some  less   that realli tell us someth about what they are expect the path to be in the futur   they are tri to infer someth about our futur path from one decis   to the extent that we can provid some more certainti or shape to that path as it relat to our inflat object or our inflat rang that we want to talk about  we are go to chang that dynam between short and long rate in a way that will remov some of that uncertainti and some of that specul about what the path is go to be  even though we can at the same  e convey some uncertainti about our individu perspect about that   so i think we want to be care not to becom too focus on what tomorrow   s market respons will be and what they care about becaus i think it goe beyond just that   i just want to share that with the group  thank you
thank you   presid
if i could just add to that   i had a similar reaction to vice chairman     when we target money suppli growth  market react to money suppli growth figur becaus they thought we were go to react to money suppli growth   if red sox victori influenc a fed fund rate set  the market would react to the red sox   obvious  we are go to manipul the fed fund rate in respons to inflat   i don   t think that is go to drop off the tabl any  soon   so it sort of sound great to say that they don   t care about inflat  that they care about the fed fund rate   well  they are go to care about inflat if they care about the fed fund rate
perhap i could say my piec again  just so he didn   t misinterpret it   of cours they care about inflat  and of cours they care about whether we are go to compet deliv accept inflat outcom over  e  my onli point was to say that even if you gave them clariti on an object at a certain horizon  in quantit term  fundament they would still want to know how you are go to achiev that  and you are still go to leav unmet their princip demand   of cours they care about inflat  and we care about inflat   but i believ that the differ they are concern about today   a central tendenc that has a    basi point spread on it   are small compar with the uncertainti that they would like us to resolv about how we are go to react to stuff   what they realli want is someth that i don   t think we can fundament give them   they realli want more certainti than we have at ani given  e about how we are go to react to a chang world  and they would like us to resolv the my i in what the futur will hold about the evolut of the economi  it is import to recogn that   but you are right  of cours they care about inflat and how we   re go to react to inflat
i would just like to add a comment in favor of uncertainti for the market   uncertainti is import in how market work   uncertainti is critic to market particip form their own view about the futur and manag the risk as they see them in the futur   everybodi talk about the famous  span put   we know  span is go to be there to save us if the market overdo it  so let   s just play into the rise market becaus the fed will save us if everyth tank   that is an overdon argument  but i have heard it made   if we give peopl a polici path  no matter how we character it  they are go to take that as far more a given than we could ever realli commit to  and they are go to make bet on that basi   when those bet don   t work out  it is go to be anoth version of the fed lead them down the garden path   i realli think we should not go there   we should encourag some uncertainti in market about what our actual polici path is go to be  given that over a three year period or a three to five year period the rang of the committe   s prefer around inflat is within some narrow band   let the market figur out what they think incom data prescrib in term of polici and make their bet on that basi   i think a certain degre of uncertainti is absolut healthi for market
i thank vice chairman   for clarifi his view   i couldn   t agre more that there is a vast rang of uncertainti out there about which we can   t help market and they can   t help us   we would all like to know more about the futur   that is whi it is imper  to me at least  that we focus on resolv the uncertainti we can resolv   foremost on that list would be our come to term with decis that we eventu will have to make about our intent   just leav it at that
presid  n
well  i  too  strong am in favor of the direct you have propos  mr  chairman  and the reason that you laid out for move in this direct   i would urg us to move as prompt as is practic down this path   i am fair flexibl about mani of the specif that would accompani this path becaus i think there is more than one way to skin the cat and i think it is import that we get there  befor i get to some of the specif  let me just say that i went back and look at a fair recent chronolog of our chang to communic go back to        i don   t know whether i got everyth  all action were not equal signific  and of cours  we don   t have the counterfactu  so we don   t know what would have happen had we not taken these step   but i think it is fair to say that all our increas in communic  begin with the press releas back in      up through the expedit of the minut and so forth  with the benefit of hindsight have work out well   they have work out well in part becaus we give these thing pretti care consider and long deliber befor we move ahead   i think we have done that in this case as well  and so we are well posit now to move ahead with this  as far as some of the specif go  yes  i would be in favor of the quarter frequenc   for now i would favor stick with the three year horizon   i am not particular oppos to a longer one  but at least to date i think the three year horizon would be a signific advanc   it seem to have work out reason well as far as the trial run are concern  and i would do that   in term of the general shape of the latest trial run  the level of anonym  and so forth  that was all fine with me  so i wouldn   t see ani need to make ani particular chang with regard to that   with regard to the form in which the project should be releas  i think i would come down in favor of presid     s suggest as some sort of appendix to the minut   i think that will give us more flexibl over  e and it will not be a big problem to make sure that whatev we say in the minut is consist with those project   i think that is a manag issu  so i would favor that   i would also favor cut off the project as soon as possibl after the meet for a coupl of reason   one is that not do it rais the potenti for confus of what we know and when we know it  which we can and should avoid  i also think that we don   t realli want to put much emphasi on high frequenc data   just becaus you get one or two more observ  most of the  e they don   t make much differ  but even when they seem to indic a signific departur from what we had expect  they are subject to revis or the next observ we get a day or two later may work in the opposit direct   it just  sn   t seem to me that there is a lot of advantag to emphas them  i would be in favor of expedit the minut  but i think i would defer that for now  just becaus we are talk about some major step   we ought to get those in place first  and we can come back and think about expedit the minut short thereaft  assum that this all work out well  if that   s what we want to do   there are probabl good reason to do it at the end of the day  but i don   t view that as quit as import as some of the other thing we   re talk about at this point   with that  that   s all i want to say   i think we are in the process of make some signific progress here  and i am encourag by that
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  applaud your put a concret propos on the tabl   with a committe of nineteen  and as mani move part as this could have  we could end up with a camel when we want a hors  and therefor have someth concret to react to is veri help  have said that  i have look at this question both at the strateg level and at the tactic level   let me just comment on the strateg level first   the way i process the question is that it is base on principl in some respect  and some of the principl base object are     transpar in govern is a best principl in general  and this move in that direct      it should enhanc account      it should enhanc public confid in our credibl  and     it should enhanc the influenc on outcom   that is to say  it should have a ground in result and the op  outcom should involv somewhat less risk   i am tri to process the thrust of my decis through that strateg prism   so i ask myself under what circumst this could backfir  and i think the answer is perhap that in period of veri rapid chang  volatil  turbul  sever shock  and the aftermath of sever shock  we could find this degre of explicit and degre of open problemat   but i don   t think we can manag to those kind of conting   i think we have to manag more with a view of normal  e  i see here in the committe some tension  as we address this question  between a mystiqu model of effect  which perhap op  flexibl and give us an opportunist postur and  therefor  is built around close deliber and a transpar  explicit  expos     out there    model   they both have some benefit in term of our ul  effect   so i view it as a bit of a balanc act between those two   but  as i said  i support the thrust becaus i think the principl of transpar and account trump that of maximum flexibl  if those two thing under certain circumst are oppos   i am influenc  mr  chairman  by your and don kohn   s sens that this is increment   it is a step and  therefor  is adjust   it may not be revers  but it is at least adjust  and that mean that we can tweak the overal tactic aspect of it to get it to work as effici and as effect as possibl  as to some of the specif  yes  we should proceed   four  e a year seem right  and i think we have to line it up with the monetari polici report   i like the idea of total inflat becaus i think that is where peopl live for the most part   i see the narrat best done as an addendum   regard anonym  i would say that not be anonym might be too much disclosur  so i support anonym   on the third year  i think of the third year as a statement of intent   it is our intend steadi state  if we can get there   i do see a tradeoff there   have a singl third year is more consist with account  but it put credibl a bit more at risk   so as i listen to the debat on that  i am somewhat influenc by vice chairman     s approach of allow for more flexibl in the outyear   this is not a moon land   we can   t be precis in where it come out in the thirti sixth month   we are in a world of shock and uncertainti  so i  on balanc  favor the idea of buy us some flexibl in the three to five year  efram   i like the qualit character  particular of uncertainti  for the same reason   i am not terribl in favor of acceler the minut for now   we could do that at a later date  after we have refin and nail down some of the other move part here   i don   t think it buy us enough at this  e  so i would view that as a refin that might be made at a later date   let me leav it at that
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i share mani of presid     s concern  but i come to a differ conclus becaus i strong support this propos   it is a major step  but it is increment   but i   d like to go through some of the issu that presid   discuss becaus i think that they relat to where we may be head in the futur and how we may have to handl thing now   the concern that he rais are veri  veri import one  the first is that a third year or a three to five year project   not reflect a commit   we know that there are some veri strong benefit to have a commit  a particular thing that   s import here is that be opportunist in term of chang what our view is of where we will head in the futur creat veri bad expect dynam   in fact  it creat an anti stabil influenc rather than a pro stabil influenc becaus  when you overshoot  you might tend to have higher project  similar  when you might undershoot  you might lower project   this has becom an issu  by the way  in other countri   in countri that have inflat target  when they were undershoot for a long  e  peopl actual push them to lower the inflat goal   do that turn out to have veri negat effect on the economi becaus  when you get a negat shock to the economi  peopl lower their expect inflat   that rais the real interest rate and mean that you have a contractionari impuls   that   s veri problemat and a serious concern that we have to worri about   i   ll talk about how i think we can deal with some of these issu  second  i also veri much worri about the issu of the project   although they have the benefit of give inform about what peopl   s view of our inflat goal are  they could be interpret in relat to output and unemploy as also be speed limit  goal  or whatev   in the end  that is a veri danger thing to happen  the third thing that i think is an import concern is that  without a consensus of this committe  it is much harder to deliber   it will be much harder to write our statement   i have been struggl with this   i am will to go along on this for a period of  e becaus we are still not there yet  and a question is whether we can get to a consensus   so i am will to hold off   but there will be a point at which some of us may say     gee  i can   t sign on to that statement unless a consensus is built      i think that problem could becom serious in the futur  so how do we deal with these issu   the reason that i   m comfort with this step at this point is that through speech we can clarifi some of these issu   so  for exampl  if we go with this approach  i would give a speech and say that  although some inform is here about inflat object  we should not think about it as have inform about unemploy or output object becaus we have much uncertainti about what potenti gdp or the nairu is and  furthermor  we can   t control either   so i think that we can clarifi some issu in speech   i   m sure that the chairman will do it  the point that i think is relev  and the reason i am discuss these issu  is that peopl have to realiz that  even though this step is exact the right way to proceed  it will still leav us with problem  and the realiti is that we will have to deal with them  the advantag of proceed this way is that it give flexibl  particular to the chairman for deal with the polit consider  eventu we will have to go to a numer inflat goal   not do so will get more and more unten over  e   a question is  what is the right  e to do it   what is the right  e in term of the polit environ   what is the right  e in term of where the economi is   so peopl have to be awar that this is realli a first step   to be honest  i will not be satisfi with this as the end game   at the same  e  the question is  when would be the appropri  e to move forward from here   we will have to use our best judgment on this question  and the chairman will have to use his judgment as well   so i am veri support of this propos  but i want to make clear that i think that we   re not settl the issu   i   m sure we will have to deal with them in the futur  and i think we will deal with them in the futur   so those are the general issu  let me go to some of the specif   the issu about the horizon is realli veri t i   i am veri comfort right now with a three year horizon becaus thing are work out pretti well   thank good the economi has been come out pretti much in line with our forecast   that we actual have inflat come down and that it is veri close to what the goal of anybodi on this committe would be becaus we are all between     and   percent   given a goal of     or   percent and a three year horizon  we should get approxim there   so i do not think there   s a problem now with a three year horizon   howev  i don   t see this as stabl becaus  god forbid  there could be case when we get shock and where we are substanti away from where we want to be  and then a three year horizon will not be adequ   presid   and vice chairman   made this point   the issu here is that do three year now is fine  but we will have to rethink this in the futur   at some point  we may have to go to a longer horizon  or the altern will be that we will have object   so it is one or the other   i think peopl know where i stand on that issu   i have a prefer   right now  i   m actual veri comfort with three year becaus three year plus a long run inflat goal will provid the inform that peopl need   if we don   t have a long run inflat goal  then at some point  if thing don   t go right  we may need a five year horizon as well  i get concern about provid a feder fund rate path   i am known as a person who is veri pro transpar  but i wrote a paper call    can central bank transpar go too far      the problem here is exact the one that governor   and other have mention   even though we know that  when you put out a path  it is complet conting on event and a lot of uncertainti is around it  make that clear to the public is veri hard  particular to politician who want to use thing in their own way   it   s amaz  when you testifi in the congress  you   ll say someth  and then they will tri to use whatev you say in a way exact opposit to what you said   everybodi know it is exact opposit  but they will do it anyway   so you have to be veri care with what you put out there   this has been a problem with other central bank   the swede actual had problem when they first announc their path becaus they didn   t clarifi the uncertainti and some problem aros in the marketplac   we shouldn   t rule it out in the futur  but it is a tough thing to think about   for the  e be  i would certain not advoc it  and i have serious concern about it  on the issu of the cpi versus the pce  a lot of detail are here  and my view is to let the subcommitte decid   i   ll go with whatev they want here   i do have a prefer for the cpi  but it is veri slight   i don   t even think it   s a second order issu  mayb third order  it   s not realli critic   an advantag is that cpi is better known   vice chairman   mention it is actual involv in a lot of contract   one reason that the cpi is use is that it is not revis   that turn out to be the reason that i lean to the cpi rather than the pce   i think the pce is a slight better measur  but the cpi is not revis  which will make our live simpler becaus we know that we   re make decis ex ant with the inform we have now   howev  when the pce get revis  peopl can second guess you   we   ve had this in the past  when our pce was get veri close to   percent   it turn out to be revis quit a bit upward  and then peopl said     gee  whi weren   t you tougher on inflat      so i think that use the cpi has a polit economi advantag  even if there is a slight disadvantag from a technic viewpoint  i share some peopl   s concern about the histogram   but i love to see the histogram   they were veri use to me   i like them becaus they provid inform and actual show that there is less divers   what was remark about them   and i don   t think that this will be a problem in the futur   is how close we general are   i think that actual will help dissip some of the issu in the press   but  again  i don   t feel particular strong about this issu  a veri import issu that come up here is where we put the enhanc project into our document and their relationship to how quick we do the minut  i lean toward have the project as a separ document in some form  either as an addendum or whatev  becaus i think it give us a lot of flexibl   i am go to say someth that may get me an ie  improvis explos devic  in my offic later on  but we   ll talk about that in a second    laughter   there is also an issu about the  e of the tes oni  which are happen two  e a year   i suspect that we will end up with tes oni four  e a year  and in that context it may be difficult to have the full minut done within three week   we will definit need to expedit the enhanc project   in fact  if we have the flexibl of have a separ document  we may be abl to do one and then do the other  that way we can basic reliev some of the pressur on peopl   we   re go to end up have to speed up the process on that part of the pictur  so separ them to some extent has the advantag of give us more flexibl  so the last issu  for which i may get the ie in my offic and which i think is go to happen even if i didn   t propos it  is that i think there realli is an advantag to have these enhanc project as part of a monetari polici report that is issu four  e a year   my suspicion is that we will be in a situat when we do this that the congress will like want tes oni more often   i am sorri for the chairman here  but i would welcom the increas tes oni becaus it give us a bulli pulpit from which to provid more inform to the market and to tell them our point of view   i wouldn   t have to do the tes oni  but there is a littl work becaus  as a board  we have to go over the tes oni   i   m go on vacat  so we have to do a confer call about the tes oni   i will have to do that four  e a year  so there is a littl cost for me but more for the chairman   have a monetari polici report with these enhanc project will actual be a plus   again  it give us an opportun to express our view  and i suspect that it will actual end up improv the qualiti of the monetari polici report   it could be an import part of our communic process  now  let me mention an issu so that i don   t get the ie but instead just a water gun shot at me by the staff   we have a realli serious problem right now in that our staff at the board is get sever overwhelm by work   that is of great concern to me and  i think  to other member of the board   the situat is such that  if we don   t fix it  i think the staff will break   this mean that we have to think about the product that the staff produc for us   do we absolut need them   even if we like them a bit  if they   re veri cost to produc  do we need them   this will be an issu go forward   the process that we are talk about now will increas work for the staff   if we do a monetari polici report four  e a year  it will be even wors   we may need to think about what goe on in term of fomc document   can they be done in a more effici way   do we need certain inform   what is the most effici way to run a research oper   the issu here also is that there has becom a discrep in term of the workload for the board staff versus the research staff at the bank   i think that it is great that the bank actual have the research that is come from them  which has great improv over  e   that is a major posit for the system   but the discrep in term of workload  which is kill our staff   if in fact their work is increas relat to that of the bank   is not a healthi situat for the system in the long run   so one of the thing that i am propos is more work in a sens  but the committe will need to think about the issu of how we can use our staff more effici to continu to provid us with all the servic we need  so that the qualiti of work   not decreas   if it   s done right  it can improv the qualiti of work for us and can actual take some of the pressur off the staff   so i   m do this so that i don   t end be a vic  of jihad  but i actual strong believ it   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
thank you  governor   well  first of all  let me thank everyon for extrem thought and help remark   we will be look at them  the staff will be look at them  we will proceed with this process  and we will tri to converg to the document that ul  will be the one that will be the format that we will be use   so we will be in touch with you about perhap further question  and we will be do anoth trial run for the next meet  we do want to have a few thought from you on the statement   let me propos the follow   let   s take a half hour break for lunch   when we come back   i   ve confer with governor kohn about this   let me just ask you to answer two question  one  in light of these propos chang  are you happi with the statement  or is there a chang that you would make   two  are you happi with the approv govern   the process by which we now construct the statement   the answer could be yes yes  no no   laughter    clear      p m  is the drop dead deadlin   but i hope that we can have a veri quick and effici go round on those two question   so let   s take a break for lunch now and come back in half an hour   lunch break
let us reconven   again  thank you for the veri use discuss befor lunch   let me just remind you that we need to keep this discuss within this room   it would be destruct to the whole process if we had it leak out in the next few month   so we appreci your do that  the last item of busi is just to do a go round on the statement   rememb there are two question   first  given where we seem to be go on use project and the other element we discuss  do you think that the statement is okay   what suggest do you have for chang it   second  do you have ani comment on the consult govern issu   who would like to begin   presid hoenig
as far as the statement now goe  the way i would phrase it is that i can live with what we have   if i may anticip presid   just a littl bit  i would like to see it simpler and shorter as we go forward  especi if we can move the minut closer to the meet date as we discuss here earlier   that would enabl us to do that  that   s my first comment   on the govern  i think the way we do it right now is fine   if we are go to have the statement as it is now structur  the process seem to be work  and i don   t see ani need  again  to vote on it
could i add to the govern question the issu of what we vote on as a committe   should we vote on the whole statement or just the first and fourth section as we do now
well  i guess the way i would answer that is i would not chang the way we do it now becaus i   m not sure if it   s the first or the fourth section    laughter
so the practic implic is that it realli wouldn   t be legi  if we agre with that to dissent on the descript of the economi or inflat
that   s right
if we agre on that   but we will hear what peopl have to say   thank you   presid  n
thank you   i   m basic happi with the statement as it is now   it   s not exact where i thought i would come out  honest   but if you look at it  it   s realli pretti straightforward and   what it need to do   by which i mean that it provid a concis  but i would say valuabl  rational for the decis   that has to includ  and it    someth that   s forward look a bit becaus obvious with the lag in polici we   re not just make decis base on look in the rearview mirror   i don   t think it   s too long   it   s onli  if i count this up right  seven sentenc or someth like that   that  sn   t strike me as excess long   in fact  other thing be equal  i would probabl be in favor of ad to it rather than reduc it  but i don   t think it   s worth the effort base on my experi around this tabl in recent year    laughter   so i think it   what it should do and   it reason effect   i have no inspir  i guess  for how to improv it in ani signific way   i do think it will continu to evolv just as the economi  the outlook for the economi  and the posit of polici do   that   s inevit  as far as govern is concern  i would prefer vote on the entir statement  but i don   t think that the current system is so bad broken that we absolut  posit need to do someth about it   but it seem as though we spend a fair amount of  e on it  so i don   t know whi we wouldn   t at the end of the day vote on it
thank you   presid pool
thank you   i think the statement is okay   i am a littl concern that we modifi it case by case   today we had this issu about    elev    or    somewhat elev    and how would we chang that without give a messag that we don   t intend   i don   t know whether we can craft languag that would avoid that sort of case by case issu  it seem to me that after we go through the project exercis  we might want to come back to that   on govern  i could go either way   i think it   s okay the way it work becaus we fulli discuss the issu   if there   s sen ent to vote on the full thing  that   s fine  too
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you   i   m basic happi with the statement the way it is now   like presid  n  i was lean on the side of make it shorter  but when i start to look at where i would cut  it was veri hard to come up with place to cut   i don   t think that adopt some of the chang that you outlin earlier will shorten the statement   it could chang how we character element of the statement  especi the rational section   when we talk about econom growth  we can character it more as it relat to the central tendenc project that we   ve provid   then when we character inflat  rather than use word like    remain elev    or    will moder further     the public will have the benefit of our project on a quarter basi  and it might be easier then to describ how we view the inflat situat   then also by adopt a total measur for inflat  it will be easier and  again  clearer when we   re say word like    inflat    or    inflationari pressur      the public will better understand what measur we   re look at  so i don   t think that the new approach or the revis approach would chang the length  but it might help us in the communic process  and i   m happi with the way that we   re do the risk assess in the statement now  in term of govern  i think that the public view the statement as a product of the committe deliber  and for that reason i think have the committe vote on the full statement would be help   in that regard  vice chairman   made a comment earlier about if we go that approach  let   s make fewer chang at the tabl and focus on give our input to the statement befor the meet   if we do some of the edit at the tabl  we don   t have  e to reflect on how those chang will be interpret   so have fewer chang at the tabl would be help   thank you
thank you   presid
i like the statement as is   i was one of those who  when we consid acceler the releas of the minut  thought that it would take some weight off craft the statement  which we could shorten   ala  i was incorrect  and that was sort of hopeless   so i   m give up   i sort of like the length the statement is now   it   a reason job with what it    with one except   the last section  the so call balanc of risk assess   i   ve argu this mani  e when we   ve talk about this   the intent is to convey the like next direct of interest rate chang   our general practic has been   there have been some except   to describ the risk to the thing we care about  and we invit peopl to deduc what we think of as the like next direct of interest rate move by invert our polici reaction function somehow   i alway thought that was problemat  needless obscur  and i like the  e when we craft that statement fair direct and explicit with phrase like    polici firm     about the balanc of risk assess  i hesit to put someth els on the tabl  but we ought to think about the direct  too  becaus the balanc of risk assess came into the statement becaus it was in the direct and there was a tilt statement in the direct that origin in the      s as a way of provid the committe   s sens of constraint on the chairman   s discret to make intermeet move   that   s my understand of how it aros   then it came to be about the next meet when we did intermeet move  and now it   s just sit there in the direct  and i don   t know what good it   in the direct realli   you know  we don   t make intermeet move    i don   t know what our understand is about discret about intermeet move   i think that we   re suppos to have a confer call with everybodi   so i don   t know whi we need this littl direct in there  and it seem to me you could just take it out of the direct  about govern  i   m in favor of vote on the whole thing   i rememb talk at one point with i think it was you  mr  chairman  and other about how it is backward for us to talk about the statement   to do negoti about the statement   a week befor we even talk to each other or read the  book   but i don   t think that   s so problemat   it  sn   t end up put our feet in cement realli  and i think we   ve been abl to have suffici flexibl dure the meet despit what we said the week befor   so i don   t view that as terribl problemat
regard the first question  the statement  i think the process is work well at this point  and so i don   t see ani need for major chang in it   given the consensus on move forward on these project  i think that fit in quit well with the exist process we have for the statement   my feel is to minim forward look comment in the statement   we never use to do this  and then we got into it with phrase like    consider period     and    patienc     and so forth  and then we evolv to a statement in which we say    futur polici adjust depend on the evolut of the outlook for inflat    and so forth  and the data come in   so we don   t realli have a forward look statement current  but my prefer is to use forward look statement onli when it realli is import to serv a specif purpos for the committe   i tend to agre with     that you could drop the last part of the statement  on the govern issu  it seem artifici not to vote on the entir statement becaus we spend so much  e talk about all part of it   so on balanc i would say  yes  we should vote on the entir statement   one issu was rais in the background materi about whether the statement should be the chairman   s or the committe   s   i think it should be the committe   s   it would put the chairman in an awkward posit not to have it as a statement of the committe   if it wasn   t a statement of the committe  peopl would tri to pull us apart by ask us question individu as to whether we agre with    the chairman   s statement      so i think the process we have now is just right and that it should be a committe statement
just to clarifi your comment on forward look languag  your exampl were about polici  like    consider period    or whatev  but not necessarili     your comment appli to statement like    output is go to grow at a moder pace
no  i should have clarifi that   no  in term of comment in the statement about the outlook for the economi  yes  i think that   s fine   i was think of the outlook for polici
i also had a two hander on that   so in term of thing like    predomin concern     which is kind of forward look for what our concern is in the futur  would you have that or would you cut out the whole fourth section
no  when appropri  i would keep that   but i was think primarili of the last sentenc that we had happen there   my recollect is that it evolv from    a consider period    to    patienc    and so forth  and then we got into    it will depend on the outlook for inflat and econom growth
i   m not sure i heard you clear     but i want to clarifi   i was advoc elimin the risk assess from the direct  but i would keep that section in the statement
well  thank you  mr  chairman   i think the statement is just about right   i like the current length and structur   i would not want to see a great deal more detail in it about our assess of the economi   i think that should wait for the minut  but i don   t think there   s anyth that   s in the statement now that we should cut   the statement has evolv  and we have in practic avoid do someth formula in term of the balanc of risk   we do not have the same languag all the  e   we some  use forward look polici languag and some  we don   t   that   s good   i think we should avoid anyth formula and just do what   s appropri in the given condit   when we were on a path of rais the fed fund rate from   percent  and we had everi expect that we would be involv in a seri of step over  e  it would have been high artifici to avoid indic in the statement that this was our expect   it was import to signal it use forward look languag   so i wouldn   t want to take forward look languag off the tabl   it  sn   t seem too import now when our own expect is for a flat path   so i think the statement is work well   i   m realli amaz at how well the process of draft the statement is work too
well  consid the group    laughter
initi when we start get into circul idea about it befor the meet  i thought     oh  this is go to be chaotic and spin out of control      i   ve been amaz at how thorough construct it has been   that by the  e we walk in here and have the statement  it has actual evolv a fair amount   i think it has alway been an improv  and we have been abl to have draft session  and they have work out surpris well  on the govern  i think this thing has accident fallen into a govern hole  and it need to be clean up   the committe should vote on the whole statement   that   s what the outsid world think now  they just haven   t notic that we don   t
thank you veri much   i   m relat happi with the statement  along the line that presid   and   discuss  i would tri to stay away as much as possibl from forward look languag or commit   there   s a  e and a place        go forward   move from   percent up was a uniqu occurr  i think  so i would realli focus the statement  as we most do now  on what we did and whi we did it   whi we did it has a forward look compon to it   it has to depend on what we expect the economi to look like in the futur and where we expect inflat to go  someth referenc both of those thing has to be in there   if i had my druther  i   d be agnost about whether or not we do an assess of risk each and everi  e  rather  consid what that add to or possibl subtract from in term of the statement   so i wouldn   t be commit to do a section   each and everi  e   it   s realli good  to the extent we can do it  to stay away from formula languag and to focus the statement as much as we can on what the realiti are at the  e of what we did and whi we did it  in term of process  with anyth edit by nineteen peopl  the process is not alway op    get a littl sens of where the staff is the week befor is help   it has allow peopl  myself includ  from  e to  e to weigh in  to actual be heard befor the meet and to make some chang to the draft statement that we look at in the meet  i can understand the desir not to do too much edit around the tabl   howev  i thought that one of the reason that we went to more two day meet was so we could all get a read on what other were say and think on the one day  think about it and ani implic it had for what we said and how we said it overnight  and then bring those thought to the tabl the next day   i alway thought that there was a lot of logic to the process and that it probabl add to rather than subtract from the amount of comment around the tabl  particular when you find yourselv in a bit of a tenuous or dicey situat with regard to how to character how peopl are feel about thing   so i think i   d be will to bear a littl more nois around the tabl rather than a littl less  on the govern issu  i think this start as the chairman   s statement becaus nobodi had the stomach for nineteen peopl edit   so it was better to let it be the chairman   s statement  and therefor we didn   t have the right to edit it   now  of cours  we edit it  so it  sn   t seem reason to me not to vote on the entir statement   i think it   s easi enough to make that chang   the whole thing is so esoter anyway that i can   t imagin that anybodi asid from us know that we don   t vote on it or has even focus on it   the idea that peopl are go to dissent on the statement   we   re not dissent on polici   i find it difficult to think that dissent on the statement is go to be a big issu  but it is alway possibl  i suppos   were there ani other govern issu   i think i probabl said this   the current approv process is difficult  but given the abil to look at some form of a draft the week befor  to be abl to think overnight  and provid some substanc to the edit process the next day  i think it work okay
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i think the statement should be a statement of the committe   i don   t have ani problem with the current govern structur  although i think it   make sens for everybodi to vote on it sinc we hammer it out anyway   i wouldn   t chang the languag   we do have one sentenc that we alway repeat  which to me is a given   that our futur polici action will depend on the evolut of the outlook  et cetera  et cetera   i guess we should say that everi  e  but i   m not sure we have to say that everi  e   it   s a given   otherwis  i   d keep it the same  although i promis to continu to lobbi for the word    global    from here to infin    laughter   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   like the other  i think the statement has basic evolv into a veri good place   i some  worri that the process of put a statement togeth by nineteen peopl will mean that there   s too much inertia in the process  but so far  mayb becaus the economi hasn   t jerk around veri much recent  we   ve been abl to keep up   but i do think we need to make sure that the languag  sn   t lag the event or  if event start to move  we   ve got to be will to chang the languag even though it   s hard here   i like the way the balanc of risk section has evolv from talk about what   s go to happen to the fund rate   i agre with presid   that it was appropri in the particular circumst   to talk about the right hand side of the taylor rule   that is  what   s go to happen to the output or inflat gap   so i think that   s posit   it give a littl veri vagu guidanc about what the committe is most worri about  and i think that   s probabl help to the market   that is then elabor in the minut  but it fill a three week gap befor the minut come out   certain if we chang our mind about where we saw the risk to the economi  we would probabl want to tell peopl about that befor those minut come out   so basic you   re in a pretti good place here  and it will continu to evolv   we just have to allow it to continu to evolv  on the govern side  i think the edit is also go pretti well   when we got into the pre meet edit  i was a littl concern that the decis were go to move outsid the room   but the process has evolv in a way that we get close to what the final statement is in these pre meet session  and then we can fine tune the languag at the meet   that   s probabl where we need to be if we   re go to put out a statement   so i   m comfort with where we are there   i think that most peopl outsid this room think that the committe is respons for the whole statement  and we probabl ought to acknowledg that by make the committe respons for the whole statement   but if we do that  we ought to understand among ourselv that the hurdl for dissent on word should be veri  veri high or els we will get ourselv into a govern mess   those are my thought
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i like the statement format and process and  like governor kohn  think that the govern  while it is not urgent to chang  will catch up with the realiti and with the expect   thank you
thank   much as gari  n has said  as an academ i was never particular enamor of the statement   but actual have seen how it evolv  how it is built   usual when you see the way the sausag is made  that upset your stomach  but it has actual been the opposit    laughter   mayb i have been eat the sausag for too long now   i don   t know    laughter   i   ve been taken in by it   but i think  as governor kohn has said  it has evolv in a way that mani of the element that i was more critic of a few year ago are not there now   i think it oper in a perfect reason way  some peopl have mention how the statement could chang if we speed up the minut   we   re never go to speed up the minut beyond say a week   even if we were to get it to a week  which i don   t think is feasibl  the statement can   t chang all that much  we have to convey the inform that   s in the statement   i don   t think we can say     well  gee  becaus next week we   re go to say someth  we can just cut it down to two sentenc or three sentenc      as long as there   s a week in between  and i can   t imagin there be ani less than a week in between  the statement is go to have the kind of inform that it has in it  which i think has evolv in a perfect reason way  on govern  sinc the process is work  i don   t realli see the need to chang it  there   s a possibl that down the line that concur opinion could be put out so that peopl agre to whatev the monetari polici movement is but  like the suprem court  write their own statement   sinc the process seem to be work well without leav that possibl for come in  i don   t see that it   s necessari to make the chang  although i   m open on that   thank you  mr  chairman
in term of this issu of forward look languag  i   m quit comfort with the statement and with forward look languag so long as it   s on the right hand side of the taylor rule in term of what   s go on with output and inflat   i   m actual not a fan of forward look languag in term of the feder fund rate  and in fact  i differ from some peopl on this   i realli didn   t like it  even dure the unusu period when there was some concern about deflat   in that context  it did have element that peopl might have interpret as a commit   it turn out that noth bad happen becaus the economi evolv in a reason way  but i can think of scenario dure that period  particular in      and so forth  when it might have been a real problem   so you do have the statement at the end that we   re alway conting on event   i like that statement  but what i don   t want to see is move from that to what we did in that period  except in the most unusu circumst   at the begin it was justifi in term of concern about deflat  but it actual had real potenti problem that did not aris  but i think we got lucki   so i   m veri comfort with where we are right now   i think the edit process is go well in term of the meet   there is fine tune go on  but it   s done in a veri construct way  and i think it   s work well  in term of govern  i guess i lean toward the idea that we should vote on it  for the follow reason   when you think about do polici  it   s not just what you do today that   s import   what you are signal about the futur is everi bit as import   this is the whole issu that the chairman has work with   woodford on   the issu of manag expect is not just what you do with the feder fund rate now  it   s also the path   in fact  the project that we are talk about do are veri much consist with that way of think   so the realiti is that  from a polici viewpoint  what we say in the statement is as import as what we do in vote on the feder fund rate   inde  sinc i   ve been on the board  that   s been realli the onli issu becaus we realli haven   t had much debat about the feder fund rate decis   so in that sens  if it is realli import and it is a key part of polici  it make sens for us to vote on it   i   m not worri about the issu of dissent becaus the point that you made  governor kohn  that there should be a veri high barrier is exact the way peopl have been proceed   the barrier is fair high for the feder fund rate decis  but in this case even more so   it   s just a coupl of word  and if you dissent  well  to be honest  then you   re a jerk    laughter   i don   t see ani jerk here  so my feel is that i don   t think we   re go to have a big problem
not anymor    laughter
so i   m actual quit comfort with move in that direct  thank you veri much
we have to put those word in the minut so that they get out there sooner than five year    laughter
i   ll be an outlier in term of the transcript five year from now  they   ll say     oh  god    is here
thank you  mr  chairman   it may horrifi everyon at the tabl that befor i join the committe  i didn   t actual pars this statement everi few week   laughter   i don   t have a lot of histor perspect  but i   m basic okay with the way the process work now   i think that the inclus in the statement all serv a purpos   i   m not sure i fulli understand the right and the left side of the taylor rule     but mayb afterward you can explain that to me   i view this statement as have a short term   if there are forward look statement  they are short term   they signal the next meet or two  but not much more than that   regard the govern or the vote issu  i think we should vote on the whole thing  and if we ever need to have a tie breaker  i guess i would revert to it be at that  e the chairman   s statement   but in normal circumst  we all vote and agre  and that   s it
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  am relat new to this process of watch the sausag be made   i have to confess up front that i   m a bit schizophren about this becaus i   m realli of two mind in term of the direct i think about  and i   m persuad either way   part of me  as   said  has argu that mayb the forecast exercis is go to take some pressur off all the nuanc and the  e we spend on the statement   as governor   mention  no matter how soon we get the minut out  it   s go to be tough to do that   so i   m sympathet to that argument   my view is that the minut realli provid the nuanc of what goe on in the committe  and i think that   s incred import   the onli thing i worri about in term of the statement is that it can   t provid that nuanc and it get so much attent in the marketplac so immedi so that part of me say either we want to enrich the statement and get rid of some of the inertia that   s in it  and make it longer or just make it shorter   so a part of me say that mayb what we realli ought to say in the statement is just section   and section   and let the nuanc of how we got there and what our view are be elabor in the minut   so a part of me say that it would be a simplif that tell the market what we did and how we view the assess of risk as we look at the economi  but it  sn   t tri to tell them all of the detail of what went on   we let the minut do that   i can live with the statement with way it is  but i think there might be some advantag in simplifi it so that we don   t spend so much  e argu over the nuanc of the rational and other thing   besid that  we   d get capac util out of there if possibl and just go with the overal assess of the risk  and then let the minut speak for themselv in term of the nuanc of the discuss  on the govern question  i agre with everybodi els   i think that it has been implicit a statement of the committe   the committe ought to vote on it   if you took section   and   out  there would be a lot less wordsmith and a lot less worri about whether the word were exact right and what each of us might have meant or prefer to say   so it might even make it easier to have a committe vote on that  and they   d have to worri about fewer thing   those are just some thought
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the statement has been evolv sensibl   the process is basic work   i don   t think we need to lock ourselv into ani fix view of the op  structur of the statement over  e   we should be open to chang it if it suit our purpos in specif circumst   obvious  shape expect about the stanc of monetari polici is a vital part of what we do   i   m pragmat on all the question about whether or not to have forward look languag  there are some circumst in which it may make sens in the futur as it has in the past  those should be except circumst  and use it should be done veri care and thought   but we do not need to commit not to use it   i also think the basic structur of say someth implicit about the forecast  the outlook on which our decis is base  is veri import   so we should have someth in there that refer to the expect path of output and inflat and the risk to that general as part of the signal   without that  you   d lose a lot of valu   i think i   d still be open to experi further as we have been do with introduc a bit more forward look view about the outlook for demand and inflat as part of the statement  even though that will be hard to do well  on govern  i have a veri differ view   i think that we realli should stay in this govern limbo that we now have   it   s veri import to recogn that we   ve had a huge amount of turnov in this committe   it   s import to give the chairman the flexibl to ul  be the arbit of the nuanc in the statement without have to go through a process in which he will have to figur out whether he   s prepar to have a vote with signific dissent in that context   right now we have a process in which the committe has substanti input into the shape of the signal that   s in the statement   the minut actual say that the committe agre that the statement should say x   it   s clear that the committe is implic in the statement   the chairman is obvious veri deferenti to the view of the committe in shape it  but we   re close to    percent of the way in have a formal endors by the committe of the statement   i don   t see ani virtu in go the next    percent and a lot of virtu in preserv the possibl for the chairman to say     my sens is that we should do x      i know that   s not accept to all of you  and not have that come with someth that forc a vote in that context   i just don   t think the balanc we have now is problemat  but i can envis a circumst in which the state of the world  the state of the committe  or a bunch of other thing might make a formal vote unnecessari and tilt the balanc in a way that may not make sens for the institut structur we have   you know  we have a group of nineteen  not of seven  fundament the fed model institut is base on a strong chairman  and i   d preserv that particular remain piec of that model
thank you   are there ani other comment   well  again  we   ll review the transcript and see what step we need to take   onc again  thank you for your veri use comment   the next meet is tuesday  august     if there is no other busi  then we   re adjourn  end of meet
