good morn  everybodi   the first item provision on the agenda was a discuss of the minut of our januari       meet   but michell smith is in the process of tri to shoot down a veri peculiar headlin in the new york  e  and she is write someth on that   so i   d like to postpon this agenda item until later in the meet becaus i don   t feel we ought to discuss it without her be in attend   so first let me recogn the fact that  as all of you are awar and sadden by  bob parri is attend his last fomc meet   which mean we give him two vote    laughter
it   s two more than i know about
howev  there is a restrict   one has to offset the other   we   ll be fete you at lunch  hope  and obvious we wish you the best
let   s turn to dino kos
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that   low just circul   dure the intermeet period  market fluctuat in respons to somewhat temper forecast for econom growth   while some market segment appear to be in a risk reduct mode  other were in a risk seek mode   and in the foreign exchang market  the dollar appreci after a long period of weak  most of the focus was on the dollar   yen rate amid continu veri high level of intervent by the japanes author   i   ll discuss each of these issu in turn   forward interest rate in the unit state continu to grind lower as expect for a pickup in the labor market were dash yet again   the top panel graph the three month deposit rate and the three month deposit rate three  six  and nine month forward go back to novemb           the   tripwir are date of employ report  and the number next to each tripwir is the differ between the expect payrol number and the actual number report that day   in the novemb   report  the growth of nonfarm payrol exceed expect by         but in the decemb   report  job growth undershot the consensus expect by         and that was the first of four consecut disappoint report   i should note that for this graph we use the number in the initi releas   rather than ani    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix     subsequ revis   sinc the first report is the number the market respond to   in ani case  the focus on the employ data has been intens   although a lag indic  market particip are look to the labor report to confirm other data that have alreadi turn and therebi confirm that the recoveri has durabl   treasuri yield have been edg lower sinc januari and declin sharpli on march   after the latest employ report   this morn the ten year note was yield about    percent   besid react to the employ report and other data  the treasuri market has continu to be preoccupi with the impact on treasuri yield of central bank buy   the bluebook has a box section on page   examin this issu   the middl panel on the first page of my handout graph the ten year note yield on the left scale and the aggreg amount of treasuri secur held in custodi by the new york fed on the right scale for the period start in januari        from januari      to novemb       foreign central bank hold of treasuri steadili grew from      billion to about      billion  the ten year yield travers a wide rang from about      percent dure late spring to a high of about      percent and by novemb      yield    percent   sinc novemb treasuri hold have gone up anoth      billion or so  and yield on the ten year note have declin about    basi point   but the direct quantit link between the two variabl are hard to find   in part the reason may be that we cannot gaug the direct impact of the purchas becaus  as with  il foreign exchang intervent  we don   t know the counterfactu   but certain other factor cannot be ignor when assign relat weight for whi yield are at their current level   first  as note earlier  the data have been disappoint   second  earlier comment by committe member that short term rate would stay low have affect the shape of the curv   and third  there is the possibl that some convex relat purchas among mbs investor have also kick in  though anecdot report suggest that these hedg program have had onli a limit impact so far   although the yield curv has flatten a bit in the past few week  it is still veri steep by histor standard  the bottom panel graph the spread of the ten year note less the three month bill sinc        some investor believ that yield should be much higher at the long end of the curv  but they are battl a countervail forc that should not be underes    name  the veri attract yield pickup between the financ rate and the return on longer term secur  that dynam has the capac to keep bring new investor into the trade for as long as investor believ financ rate will stay low   turn to page    breakeven rate on tip were rise   especi for the five year matur   until veri recent when nomin rate move lower and reduc the breakeven point   one interest characterist of recent price action has been the converg of the five  and ten year breakeven rate   what is unclear is whether this reflect a chang in the inflat outlook for the second five year in that  e span or whether it reflect technic reason relat to recent increas in the cpi that have had a greater impact on the valu of the five year matur   the middl left panel graph the invest grade spread  while the middl right panel graph the high yield and embi  spread and the brazilian compon of the embi   all of those spread widen after the last fomc meet and the chang in word in the committe   s post meet statement   in brazil  local event affect spread as well as the fact that brazilian paper is often use as a proxi hedg for other less liquid secur   these spread may suggest the begin of a risk reduct phase in market   to some extent this widen was long await given the concern that had been express for month about the underpr of risk in these segment   other price movement suggest the onset of a risk reduc phase includ the declin of equiti price   although all of the equiti index start the year strong  the weak in the past few week has now put all of the major u s  index into negat territori for the year to date   the pattern in european market has larg parallel event in the unit state  though not alway for the same reason   as shown in the bottom panel  expect short term interest rate have been fall in europ as well   in part the econom data did not come out as strong as the market had hope   but perhap the more import factor   until veri recent   has been the strength of the euro   with the euro   s appreci in decemb and januari  the market came to believ that the ecb would eas polici to counteract the currenc   s strength   howev  with the veri recent depreci of the euro from       to about          some of the pressur was taken off  and the ecb kept rate steadi at it last meet  nevertheless  the market still seem to place fair high odd that the next move could be an eas one   the exchang valu of the dollar has preoccupi both foreign and domest asset market   the dollar had been fall against most currenc into februari  but it then rebound sharpli  as shown in the top panel on page     the reason for the rebound seem to lie as much in the realm of technic analysi and posit adjust as in ani interpret of the fundament   data on posit are hard to come by   but one sourc that give us a glimps is the commit of trader report publish by the imm everi week for currenc futur market activ  although admit imperfect  it   offer one window into the activ of noncommerci user of futur  the bottom panel graph for the euro and the yen the number of contract held at the end of each week sinc septemb        the recent shift from more than        long yen contract to about        short yen contract repres the largest week shift in the histori of this  e seri   dure that week  there was noth in the data that could explain such a shift   it may simpli have been a case of the dollar have fallen too far too fast and a consolid need to take place   a variat on this has a link to the risk reduct stori   that is  if risk posit were be reduc  this would includ the close out of some of the larg short dollar posit that had been built up   in ani case  the longer term forecast among street economist is for the dollar to resum it declin  so the dollar   s recent rebound has not chang the under sen ent   in part that reflect concern about the current account  and in part  as shown in the two middl panel  it reflect interest rate differenti   except with the yen   that favor other currenc   the yen stori  as usual  is a bit more complic   for onc the recent data for japan have been decid more bullish   fourth quarter gdp growth  for exampl  was report to be at a   percent rate   ad in the japanes current account surplus and the inflow into japanes equiti from foreign investor  it   s not surpris to see the yen face upward pressur   the panel at the top of page   show  in the red line  the depreci of the dollar   yen exchang rate through mid march   the blue bar graph the daili intervent by the japanes monetari author   as the dollar move down  japan interven steadili and some  in massiv size to smooth the fall of the dollar   market particip note a chang onc the dollar began to rise   it appear that the ministri of financ  mof  was activ seek to push the dollar higher   in contrast to it previous action of smooth out the declin as the dollar was fall   the largest and most controversi intervent occur on march    the day of the employ report   the middl panel graph for that day the intraday evolut of exchang rate index from midnight ea n  e for the yen  the euro  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  and the pound  l   at      a m   the weaker than expect employ report was releas   yield and the dollar both fell sharpli   the except was the dollar   yen exchang rate  which disengag from other currenc rate and actual rose   the mof bought     billion dollar in the hour after the data releas and  in effect  push the rate in the opposit direct than that suggest by that new piec of fundament inform   market particip were confus by the price action  which threw some of the cross rate out of align and advers affect liquid   we   ve heard anecdot report that specul have reduc their activ in the dollar   yen currenc pair   report corrobor by data from the major interdeal broker indic that activ in dollar   yen has been flat or go down in recent quarter   the dollar   yen rate fell again late ye day and this morn follow japanes newswir report that the japanes author would ceas larg scale intervent after the end of the fiscal year   this morn the dollar was down about   yen  at          dure the intermeet period japan bought   includ overnight purchas       billion  bring to      billion it purchas in the first two and a half month of the year  for comparison   s sake  dure a veri busi       japan bought      billion over the entir twelv month span   leav asid the trial and tribul of the exchang market  other japanes asset market appear unfaz by the scale of the intervent   as seen at the bottom left  equiti price in japan rose  in contrast to the pullback in u s  and european equiti market   bank stock have continu to ralli as they have sinc the bailout of resona in may   the recent ipo of shinsei was in demand  and with gdp forecast general be rais  the bad debt situat is expect to improv somewhat  though at one point there was a sharp selloff in the japanes govern bond  jgb  market  perhap the most surpris thing about that market is how well it has perform   ten year yield still trade near     percent despit the better econom number   although there has been chatter about the bank of japan   s have to plan for an exit strategi from it veri accommod stanc  most jgb investor still seem to think that is a long way off   there were no foreign oper in this period  mr  chairman   i will need a vote to approv the domest oper
i note in the chart on the fed custodi hold of treasuri secur  shown in the middl panel on page    that there are a coupl of period of veri signific rise   if one tri to compar them with the japanes intervent data on page    it obvious  sn   t squar in the slightest   inde  it look as though the intervent of veri earli      didn   t show up in the custodi hold until the third week in januari   is that the typic  e lag
well  there are a lot of move part here   the aggreg custodi hold are for all countri
well  i assum the japanes are domin
in term of the delta  japan is obvious a key contributor   but there are a lot of major player and mani in and out in these figur   also for japan  their cash has actual been rise over the last few month   that is publish on their web site   i believ almost a quarter of their reserv  if i have my number right  are now held in cash   so they are not automat
cash mean deposit
deposit  right
where   in domest bank or foreign bank   in dollar
in bank in dollar   so it   s not that they are automat buy dollar and immedi put them into treasuri   there has been a lag  and in fact that lag actual has been grow
i thought the lag was just two or three day
well  it is if they are immedi buy secur   but again  if we look at their deposit data  we see that their cash has been rise  so they are not immedi put all of their intervent dollar to work
do the secur go into custodi at the point of purchas
at the point of settlement
i   m sorri  i meant at the point of settlement   so it   s not an issu of their purchas a secur  take it home  and then send it back  so to speak   they purchas it  and at settlement it goe into custodi as a book entri item  and that   s it
exact   again  though  one of the miss piec is how much of their dollar purchas are stay as deposit rather than go direct into secur
on the bottom chart of page    everybodi use that spread between the ten year note and the three month bill   but what the comparison in that chart is suppos to captur is better captur by use a one year matur nine year out becaus clear the ten year note is pick up an averag of everyth from one day out to ten year   i understand that it   s not a market rate   it   s a work of art  base on first differ in the chart   is there ani reason that we don   t do that other comparison instead   that   s the rate we realli want to see
yes  this is use becaus i think peopl tend to be more familiar with this relationship   i was not tri to be precis  but i want to show that there is a sens in which the peopl who have been say that yield ought to be a lot higher are realli fight this in part   that is  the spread is so high that
the spread is actual   point  not
the contour of the chart would be the same if one use the ten year ahead forward rate less  say  the one year ahead forward rate   the amplitud would be higher  and the spread would wind up at someth like   …› percent
in the short term it would be  but not as the slope of the yield curv chang   the spread is affect by that slope   the point is that what you   re tri to measur here is be muddi by the fact that the number are alreadi partial in the numer   with respect to the chart at the bottom of page    those imm commit data can   t have anyth to do with the dollar becaus the euro is unchang   it   s a technic issu with respect to the yen and has noth to do with anyth els as far as i can see
well  that   s a good point   in the interest of full disclosur  i must say that i put the euro in there just to point out that there wasn   t a univers respons from this group  now  one of the anecdot stori that we keep hear is that there   s a group of market particip   if not hedg fund then ctas and model driven account   that are becom more and more import in the marketplac   a lot of these fund use the same kind of model  and when their move averag trigger get hit  they all tend to move at the same  e   so what we seem to have had is that kind of move   in the yen in particular
yes  it look as though         contract just got   is it yen delta hedg   it   s curious
it was a dramat move   again  it seem to be veri much a posit adjust stori  and that was the point i was tri to convey   it seem to be a chang driven not by fundament but by technic factor   and those technic factor were most power in the yen
other question for dino   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   dino  i was intrigu by your thought regard the begin of a risk reduct phase   how strong do you feel about that   i may be slight behind the curv in term of the way market particip are look at this  but from peopl in the invest busi around boston  i seem to be get more comment about the amount of risk that is out there
yes  we   re realli see some crosscurr   on the one hand  if we talk to peopl who are activ in  say  treasuri  we hear a lot about the carri trade and about an expans of risk and leverag
on the other hand  there are pocket where risk reduct move do seem to be occur   where peopl have had some loss and then reduc their other posit   it   s not univers   this may be a veri short term phase that was local or limit to a coupl of market segment   we may not be talk about this in the next week or next month   so it seem as if we have some conflict forc go on here
i wonder if you had ani more thought on the dollar  dino   the dollar   s rise is rather surpris given the disappoint data we   ve had on the u s  economi and the declin in u s  interest rate   do you have some sens that attitud have chang from the pervas expect of further declin   or is this the end
well  explain exchang rate is alway a riski busi   the rebound in part seem to have been technic inspir  it   s hard to pinpoint  but i think a number of thing were go on that had some effect   i didn   t spend much  e talk about econom develop in europ  but there has not been as much of an improv in europ as peopl thought there would be three or four month ago   if europ had perform better over the last few month  then we might not have had this rebound in the dollar   on the other hand  as i point out  the under sen ent among the strategist on the street realli hasn   t chang  when the euro got to       a number of peopl thought that the market was ripe for a correct  one fellow on our foreign exchang committe  which is a privat sector group  said when the euro was at          we   ll see      befor we see           so this may be a natur process that we   re go through of a flush out of posit  and we may have a reviv of the trend we were see   but that   s one guess
as i understand it  mr  chairman  someon has to move for approv of the desk   s transact  and i   ll volunt for that duti
it   s not a great burden  i hope    laughter
it   s a lot easier than talk about the exchang rate
ani object     anyon els want to speak befor we close the question   if not  i will accept your motion and assum  without object  that the desk   s transact are approv       and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   as usual  we have receiv a mix bag of data sinc the januari fomc meet   over most of the past six month  when we said    mix    data  we general meant data that were either stronger than we had expect or that were a lot stronger than we had expect  by contrast  dure this intermeet period  we receiv figur on both side of our januari project   as you know  on net  we read the incom inform on labor market  product  and spend as suggest that there was somewhat less upward momentum to activ than we had previous thought   our largest disappoint was center in the labor market   privat nonfarm payrol were flat in februari and have been increas at a pace of onli about        per month sinc the upturn in hire began last septemb   that is well below the pace we had envis sever month ago   to be sure  initi claim for unemploy insur sinc the turn of the year have fluctuat in a rang that in the past was associ with stronger employ gain than we have experienc to date   but those data like reflect a declin in layoff  and we have scant evid  as yet  that new hire has pick up materi   there have been a few hope sign in the recent data   temporari help employ has been trend higher sinc last spring  and the averag workweek has move up sinc the turn of the year   but those look to us to be thin reed on which to rest our earlier project   as a consequ  we mark down consider our project improv in employ over the first half of the year  and along with that lower employ path  we reduc the project growth of hour work   if the pattern of the past coupl of year had been repeat  this would have been yet anoth occas for a weak labor market report to result in a further upward revis to product   but this  e  somewhat softer read on manufactur product and on spend persuad us to revis down our project of the growth of real gdp by about as much as we revis hour  leav our product project about unchang   among the slight softer indic that influenc our think was manufactur ip   despit an increas of     percent in februari  smaller gain in decemb and januari took down our project increas in factori output in the current quarter from   percent at an annual rate to   percent   obvious  this is a revis best view as one of quantit degre rather than one of qualit substanc   the anecdot report still seem to signal steadi improv in the manufactur sector   we just don   t see quit the degre of vigor that earlier indic had suggest   we also have had  on net  some negat surpris in the spend data   perhap consist with the slight softer read on ip  both export and inventori invest have come in below our expect   the weak in inventori invest is somewhat surpris to us in light of the low carri cost of inventori   we have heard report that some firm have encount difficulti acquir need materi and some discont on the part of busi with breakdown in their just in  e inventori arrang   these difficulti may have held down inventori invest   but we don   t believ this is a phenomenon with suffici breadth or magnitud to explain the meager addit that firm have made to their inventori in recent month   instead  we think the subdu pace of stockbuild like reflect the same continu cautious behavior on the part of busi that is evid in their hire decis   the singl largest sourc of downward revis to our gdp project has been construct activ  where the recent data have come in below expect for the residenti  nonresidenti  and state and local sector   to be sure  we had anticip some falloff in residenti construct from the torrid pace set late last year   but the drop off in start in januari  especi in the singl famili sector  was larger than we had pencil in   moreov  sale of new and exist home also fell signific  and as a consequ  the commiss on those sale  which are part of gdp  amplifi the slowdown of spend in this sector   homebuild figur for februari were releas this morn  and those data show anoth drop in singl famili start   from an upward revis figur of      million unit in januari to      million unit in februari   nevertheless  permit have remain quit firm  and they point to some bounceback in construct in come month   all told  these data might take a tenth off of our current quarter gdp project   nonresidenti construct activ also has come in below expect   construct of offic build  commerci structur  and manufactur facil continu to contract  although there are faint sign of improv  vacanc rate remain high and rent soft   meanwhil  although budget condit are improv among state govern  fund are still veri tight  and these entiti have further trim their construct spend   the onli other notabl area of greater than expect soft has been spend on light motor vehicl   sale averag about     million unit in januari and februari  about    million unit below our previous project   at the same  e  product of light vehicl has come in abov our expect   as a consequ  inventori appear a bit high to us   in the project  we resolv that tension through a combin of product restraint and a pickup in sale that is induc in part by a sweeten of incent   it is import to note that not all of the news over the past seven week was negat   exclud motor vehicl  consum spend was actual a bit stronger than we had expect   and busi outlay for equip and softwar were notic stronger in both the fourth and first quarter than we had project in januari   high tech spend has continu to increas rapid  while spend on capit equip outsid of high tech and transport has post a mark acceler in recent month   as you know  equip spend had appear to us to have been unusu weak over the past year or so given our view of the key fundament   a low cost of capit  acceler final sale  and ampl increas in cash flow   that gap is now close  and along with the continu boost from the partial expens provis  we are project that real e s will maintain doubl digit gain through the end of the year   taken togeth  the incom data led us to revis down the project growth of real gdp by a littl more than    percentag point at an annual rate in the first half of this year  after a bit larger revis in the fourth quarter of last year   all els be equal  multipli effect would have argu for a lower growth rate in the second half of this year as well   howev  the substanti ralli that has occur in the bond market in recent week led us to mark down our project path for long term interest rate  and those lower rate are expect to provid a consider cushion to spend go forward   still  we do have on net a lower level of real gdp  and henc a higher output gap  throughout the project period compar with our previous forecast   wherea in januari  the output gap was near elimin by late next year  in the present forecast that gap remain at near   percent of potenti gdp at the end of        with more slack in resourc util  you might have expect to see somewhat lower inflat in this project   that effect  howev  was offset by sever countervail consider   first  the incom data on core inflat were a bit abov our expect in recent month   moreov  oil price have move up sharpli and are expect to stay higher for longer than in our januari forecast   and final  the price of non oil import have increas more rapid of late than we had anticip earlier  the bottom line is that we still expect core pce price to increas about   percent this year and next   step back from the detail of the forecast  we continu to believ that the data and the anecdot are consist with an economi that is expand fast enough to take up slack in the economi   s util of resourc   we expect fiscal s ulus  accommod monetari polici  and ongo rapid gain in structur product to sustain a brisk expans through the end of next year   come as it has on the heel of an extend period of most upsid surpris  the event of the past seven week  includ last week   s bomb in spain  have clear restor a sens of two way risk to the outlook   just how larg are those risk   well  that   s a question that we have been work to answer more precis for you   as you know  we includ confid interv around some key variabl in our forecast as a standard featur for the first  e in this  book   over the past few year  we have shift somewhat the emphasi of our forecast present away from a singl narrat focus on explain the baselin project toward inclus of more materi highlight some of the chief risk surround the econom outlook  the present of confid interv for the project seem to us a logic extens of that effort   we have calcul those confid interv both use the real  e track record of the staff forecast and use stochast simul of our larg scale econometr model   we thought sever purpos could be serv by includ these measur in the  book   one veri import purpos is to illustr how much uncertainti surround the staff baselin project   for this purpos  the confid interv calcul use the actual forecast record of the staff project would seem the most inform measur   those interv are  inde  wide   the    percent confid interv around our project of a    percent unemploy rate in the fourth quarter of      run from    percent to   percent   similar  the    percent confid interv around our forecast of a   percent increas in core pce price in      run from about zero to   percent   and it is import to rememb that this impli that there is a    percent chanc that the actual outcom will lie outsid these bound   the width of these band   provid me with one small consol   when ask in the past how confid i have been about various aspect of our project  i believ the record will show that i have almost consist respond    not veri      it look as though i   ll be pretti safe stick to that answer    laughter   we also includ in the tabl and as fan chart confid interv generat by stochast simul of frb us   the reason that we have ad this second approach to the mix is that it allow us to undertak calcul that cannot be perform with the  book forecast error   for exampl  we can decompos sourc of forecast uncertainti in the way that we did recent in a pre fomc brief for the board  break out inflat uncertainti into uncertainti about suppli  demand  and the unexplain equat residu   this approach also provid us with an abil to comput certain condit probabl   for exampl  probabl of deflat under differ monetari polici   we have provid some of this materi to the committe in the recent past  and we anticip do more of the same in the futur   we also will continu to plot in the fan chart the altern scenario that we present in the  book   like the confid interv display in those chart  the altern simul are generat use our larg scale model   a number of you have remark on occas that  after read the descript of the altern scenario  you were surpris to see that all we got on gdp growth or the unemploy rate were a few lousi tenth and  in most scenario  consider less than that on the inflat rate   i have note in respons that a drawback to the altern scenario is that they do not account for all of the covari in the shock to which the economi is subject   the confid interv generat by stochast simul do just that   by place the altern scenario in the fan chart  we hope to provid you with a better perspect on just how much of the probabl space we are explor with those altern   final  the confid interv may provid a context for the committe to consid the uncertainti surround the project that you includ in the monetari polici report to the congress   as you know  those forecast are present as rang and central tendenc   but  of cours  rang and central tendenc are measur of forecast consensus  not measur of forecast uncertainti   base on our past forecast error  the    percent confid interv surround our forecast of the unemploy rate in the fourth quarter of this year is about    percentag point wide  in contrast  the width of the fomc   s forecast rang of the unemploy rate in the fourth quarter of this year was just   percentag point wide   so  while there is consider consensus on the committe about the expect unemploy rate late this year  there is probabl much greater uncertainti associ with each of your individu forecast   needless to say  advertis our ignor in such an explicit fashion gave us some paus   but given the increas preval of product liabil lawsuit  we thought some appropri warn on the  book forecast was warrant  perhap the confid interv should be view as someth like a warn label that read     do not oper larg economi while under the influenc of a baselin project alon        will now continu our present
the staff forecast for econom activ abroad this year and next is one of moder robust growth and contain inflat   this favor pictur reflect the rebound in the global high tech industri as previous overinvest has been work off  the posit spillov to the rest of the world of the expans of the u s  economi  and the fruit of the accommod polici  particular monetari polici  that has been in place in mani foreign economi for some  e   expans abroad is no longer just prospect   although foreign growth dure the second half of last year did not match that in the unit state  it rebound sharpli from the troubl outcom dure the first half of the year  with total foreign real gdp growth averag more than    percent   to be sure  there were substanti differ across countri  with those in emerg asia charg ahead and those in the euro area onli inch forward   nevertheless  by the fourth quarter of last year the expans was widespread and becom more firm establish   indic for the current quarter confirm that this process has continu   in some economi where growth was unsustain strong  such as japan and china  we are look for some moder go forward   and we expect that output in the euro area will acceler a bit further this quarter and next to come closer to the potenti rate of growth for that region   of cours  i would not be do my duti to you if i did not look for the black cloud among all this sunshin   two issu seem to merit further discuss   recent develop in oil and other primari commod price and concern about the ever expand need to financ the u s  extern deficit   despit persist forecast of declin oil price  spot price for wti have risen from about     per barrel to     over the past six month  includ a    per barrel rise sinc your januari meet   to some extent  the higher oil price have been mute abroad as mani foreign currenc have appreci against the dollar  accord  the balanc of demand and suppli in the global oil market would tend to push up dollar oil price at a  e of general dollar depreci   other factor support spot oil price are the current low level of inventori  opec product polici  the risk of instabl in some oil suppli countri  and the strength of demand as the global economi expand   nevertheless  futur market continu to expect declin in the price of oil go forward   were ani of sever possibl suppli disrupt to occur  the result spike in oil price could threaten the global recoveri and put some upward pressur on price more broad   nonfuel global primari commod price also have risen sharpli in recent month   util spot and futur price  we project that these commod price will increas at an annual rate of near    percent in the current quarter befor deceler sharpli and even revers a bit later this year and next   such sharp run up in commod price have occur previous   this forecast appli broad to all the categori of nonfuel primari commod   thus the outlook is that the veri rapid rate of increas in these price will prove transitori  in part becaus of suppli factor and the expect suppli respons to strong demand   some have express concern that the inflat in commod price is a lead indic of rise inflat pressur more broad throughout the global economi  within industri countri  howev  primari product price are a veri small input into the determin of price for final product   and a relat price chang in favor of primari good will onli partial retrac a trend against their relat price that has been ongo for some  e   nevertheless  particular bottleneck for some product could aris if demand for primari product remain strong  support by continu rapid output growth in china and elsewher   debat about the risk to the global economi pose by the larg and grow u s  current account deficit has been rise in volum as global recoveri proceed   two data releas to the public sinc the  book was distribut   the tic data on januari capit flow and the balanc of payment data for the fourth quarter   provid some inform on how that deficit has been financ in recent month  the tic data were discuss in part   of the  book as we had that data befor thursday   as was the case in novemb and decemb  foreign privat net purchas of u s  secur were quit strong  revers the sharp reduct in those purchas seen in septemb and octob   financi market concern that these data might be signal a major shift in foreign prefer away from u s  asset appear alreadi to have abat   when these data were releas on monday morn  there was littl market reaction   the balanc of payment data contain new inform on u s  net invest incom in the fourth quarter  that figur came in signific more posit than we had been expect and impli a current account deficit in that quarter about     billion less than in the  book   this posit revis is entir explain by higher incom receipt on u s  direct invest abroad  which in part is due to the depreci of the dollar and the result higher dollar valu of record foreign profit   in respons to these data  we have narrow our project for the current account deficit this year and next by about     billion and     billion respect  these data onli add to the my i of how the world   s largest debtor countri can earn signific net incom on it foreign invest posit   the balanc of payment data also report the complet pictur of capit inflow and outflow for      and gave us our first look at the foreign direct invest figur for the fourth quarter   for the year as a whole  the major compon of foreign privat capit flow to the unit state  secur purchas and direct invest  remain veri larg   around      billion   and were not much chang from the figur for        yet much has been made of the increas in the foreign offici hold of dollar   these net purchas doubl between the two year from around      billion to a bit over      billion  two item in the balanc of payment data reconcil these fact   first  u s  investor switch from be net seller of foreign secur to net purchas and at the same  e u s  foreign direct invest abroad remain strong   so u s  capit outflow experienc a swing of about      billion to about      billion   second  the current account deficit itself widen about     billion   thus capit inflow face a larger financ hurdl in      than in        look ahead  we see the current account deficit continu to present a move target  reach      billion by the end of next year   capit outflow are particular hard to forecast  but our project call for them to rise slight over the forecast period   our forecast for onli a slight downward tilt in the foreign exchang valu of the dollar impli that some combin of privat capit inflow to the unit state plus increas in foreign offici hold will will financ the expand deficit plus the outflow that occur at exchang rate near those of today   this may seem like a major challeng   but i point out that the foreign privat net purchas of u s  secur in decemb and januari  when express at an averag annual rate  by themselv come to near      billion   dave and i would be happi to take your question
do you have ani breakout on foreign affili earn in foreign currenc and the extent to which earn are convert to dollar   result in much larger amount of dollar at the prevail exchang rate
i ask my staff if they could make that decomposit  and i basic got    no    for an answer    laughter   the dilemma is that we   re talk about look at this across all the differ currenc and all the differ
there   s a lot of hedg go on
i understand   and that is shift a bit when this valuat effect show up and when there were offset gain on the one hand versus loss on the other  rememb we   re talk now about u s  earn abroad  not foreign earn here   at ani rate  the staff did not seem hope that they could disentangl the earn in euro  yen  canadian dollar  and pound and the exchang rate effect as report in these data   we know the general tendenc  but we don   t have enough data to do the actual account that would disentangl that
i know you eventu get it  but at this stage do you have the foreign affili earn by major geograph area
i rais that question   i think what we   d have to do at this point is to look at annual report or someth   at some later point we may have those data
in other word  commerc publish the data but with a signific lag
i ask becaus theoret one could take the dollar earn and liter convert them back to their foreign currenc
back to their foreign currenc
of cours  you don   t know what   s hedg and what isn   t hedg  but at least it give you a rough idea   the problem is that you need to wait for the earn data
and we would have to do it over  e in order to track foreign earn versus the imput exchang rate effect that we would have inject into that calcul
yes  a signific part of that is the oil earn of u s  compani   i must tell you  though  that if you tri to reconcil compani report with the commerc number you will think you   re look at two separ univers   the bookkeep that goe on there make enron   s bookkeep look like account i   presid pool
i have a question about page    in part   of the  book  which has to do with the assumpt on labor product through        you have product growth drop to onli     percent from     percent in      and     percent last year   i ask bob rasch to look at the  e seri properti  and it look as if labor product growth is pretti close to a random walk   obvious it can   t be liter a random walk   but you have a major drop in       and perhap you could explain where that come from
it   s a deceler  not actual a declin  in product   that deceler in product is a function of the fact that by our read  even with what we consid to be a fair op ist view on the growth of potenti output  the level of product is abov it long run trend   this pattern look to us like standard cyclic behavior   what we have is a deceler in product as it goe from abov trend back toward trend   that result in a slowdown in the growth of product and account for the step up in payrol employ that we believ will occur   again  that look to us to be consist with the cyclic  e seri perform of product around a spline function type trend  which is basic the way we put togeth the longer run product forecast   so as mani of you have note over the past year or so  that forecast incorpor a signific element of risk   it certain has been an area where we have been wrong and wrong rather consist in one direct over this particular period   that is  in anticip that some of what we perceiv to be cyclic increas in product are go to abat go forward   as i think i respond to presid   at the last meet  we realli just don   t have a lot to go on in term of gaug how much of a backlog of one  e effici improv still exist out there   so in write down these figur in our forecast  we are tri to blend some judgment and some econometr   but this is inde an area where our confid is not terribl high
an implic would be a major swing in unit labor cost next year compar with this year  and presum that might affect the inflat outlook   at ani rate  i think this is a fair import part of the outlook for        growth in product of     percent  of cours  is equival to the miser         averag   i understand the argument for it
that would be an averag over a long period of  e wherea this would be a relat brief period of somewhat lower cyclic growth   on the inflat point  i would just note that we don   t think there is a big effect on price from swing in unit labor cost that are associ with cyclic movement in product   we tend to believ that firm in their price behavior tri to look through cyclic movement   so the implicit acceler in unit labor cost that is incorpor in this project   not exert much upward pressur on inflat
but  of cours  it also feed into the employ outlook
right  employ and profit both   i think in some sens in the forecast we have a cyclic slow in profit that also look to us to be fair typic   what we typic see is a big increas in profit when product is soar in the earli stage of a busi cycl and then  as product slow down  profit growth slow as well and the labor share begin to recov   admit this cycl has been one where everyth has been more drawn out  so to speak  than has been the case in the past   and becaus of that we feel much less confid in gaug the  e of that cyclic slow in product
except for the second half of last year  we haven   t had the typic recoveri surg   so in one sens we may not be veri far into the expans phase of the cycl
that   s a veri real possibl
this is obvious part of the       project  but i was veri interest in where that came from   thank you
dave  there is a simul call    rise inflat expect    in the  book in which inflat expect increas gradual by   percentag point   i don   t know from what level to what level  but i do know that some of the survey that we see  such as the blue chip survey  suggest that inflat expect are quit high   around    or     percent   i think it would be interest to know what the result of a declin inflat expect scenario would be becaus  if inde the market expect   percent  it   s possibl that view could chang   if that were to occur  i would assum that conceiv we could see inflat rate move down from current level   so i   d find that to be a more interest altern   but i just don   t know what the level were in the scenario where the inflat expect number rose   percent   it went up from what to what
actual  i   d have to go back and ask our model folk becaus it   s in term of the implicit inflat expect that is embed in that model
i bet it   s a lot lower than
i   m sure it   s lower than     percent
you could exogen make it     percent
we highlight this scenario in part becaus the model probabl incorpor lower inflat expect than those of some market particip   and in light of the declin in the dollar and the acceler of commod price  there are at least a few straw in the wind that suggest that perhap inflat will not be as sanguin as we are forecast   so we want to highlight that possibl to some extent   but i think you   re absolut right  around our baselin forecast we see that risk balanc against a risk that inflat expect could come down further and mayb even consider further   if our inflat forecast begin to materi in the data   surpris peopl in term of how benign the behavior of price will be   inflat expect could declin   and if the increas in commod price and the declin in the dollar realli are not provid much upward impetus to inflat  one could see a break to the downsid as well  as we note in the  book  anoth downsid risk that we see on the inflat side is that the markup over unit labor cost look veri high to us and that   s associ with strong profit as well   we have that onli tip down over the forecast period  in part owe to the assum deceler in product   it   s certain possibl  though  that we could get a sharper declin as competit pressur put more downward pressur on the price markup   that would be anoth sourc of signific lower inflat go forward   so while we view the risk as reason balanc  we certain think we could have declin inflat expect as well as increas expect
okay  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to ask a question about the labor market   the labor forc particip rate has been declin  as has been wide describ in the press   some of us were talk about this earlier  note that a signific part of the declin is due to a reduct in the teenag labor forc particip rate   there has been a big increas in school enrol rate for teenag as well   i was wonder if you had ani thought on these develop and their implic for the tight or weak of labor market and also for inflationari pressur
we have interpret this downturn in labor forc particip as princip a cyclic phenomenon   nevertheless  we have revis down the level that we think the labor forc particip will eventu return to  we   ve revis that down in light of the employ data   but the basic messag of our forecast is that a lot of the peopl who have withdrawn from the labor market will make themselv avail again when the economi and job prospect begin to improv  admit  we can   t see that from the discourag data becaus  as you point out  the reason peopl give for leav the labor forc includ leav for school or to take care of home respons   and an increas number of peopl are report that they are retir   so it   s possibl that the reduc labor forc particip will prove to be more persist than we are anticip   if that   s the case  then in essenc there is less slack in our baselin forecast   if we get our growth forecast along with less of a bounceback in labor forc particip  there will be a bigger declin in the unemploy rate than we   re show  and the labor market could tighten more immedi   the result would be greater pressur on inflat than we   re show  i was go to say that i feel reason confid  but i guess i should strike that word from my lexicon  so i will say that we feel comfort in our belief that a signific part of this downturn in particip will prove to have been cyclic   that   s in part becaus of the  e of the downturn   the peak in particip coincid so close with the peak in the tight of the labor market and the deterior coincid so close with the period of persist weak labor market that it   s hard to think that it was not cyclic   it would be difficult to consid it a coincid that the trend turn signific downward start right at the peak of the busi cycl   but obvious that remain a risk   we see the risk in this aspect of the project more as one in which labor market could tighten more quick than we   re forecast
so the increas in school enrol is someth that we   ll see wash out as the labor market tighten
yes   part of the complic that has arisen in do this analysi is that the question in the household survey on labor forc particip were chang in the mid     s  as you know   consequ  we have no cyclic experi in term of how peopl actual were respond to these question about be in the labor forc and whi they were in or out of the labor forc   so we   re uncomfort with our abil to look at past cyclic pattern and draw a lot of infer from that go forward
bill wascher and his group  as you may know  are tri to simul the old breakdown   if they succeed  we   ll probabl learn a few thing about this issu
yes  bill has been work on the issu   but ul   though we may be abl to draw some infer  it   s go to be hard to believ   given that the question were chang   that we   re get someth that track veri close with past cyclic behavior  but he is attempt to do that decomposit
ani further question for our colleagu   if not  who would like to start the committe discuss   presid

pre fomc brief at the bank  one of the economist note that someth has to give  that is  the current situat of high product  strong demand  and zero job growth just  sn   t seem sustain   on the downsid  if product growth continu to increas as it has  employ could languish further   even if demand is relat good   and inflat could trend downward as well   this could happen  too  if consum becom dishearten by the job scene and stop buy hous and car regardless of the low interest rate   demand would falter despit solid product growth  and the output gap would widen  on the upsid  busi uncertainti could well dissip fa  than we expect  employ growth could come fa  or be stronger than either our forecast or the  book expect  push product down in the short run and push wage up  particular for worker with hard to find skill   price of oil  certain metal  steel scrap  and other commod have risen   the dollar seem bound to depreci a bit further   and health insur cost continu to acceler   as one contact put it  the cost of all the    nice to have    thing continu to drop while the cost of thing peopl realli need    like hous  health care  and educ   keep rise   i recogn that this is not how our measur of price trend captur what is happen  but it may say someth about both the popular of treasuri inflat protect secur and the resili of inflationari expect  i also remain concern that the current veri accommod stanc of monetari polici and the assur that market seem to have that we are on hold has increas leverag across all market   when rate return to a more neutral place  as they ul  will  this could creat a burst of financi instabl   contact tell me  as i note befor  that market particip are reach out the risk curv for return in this low interest rate environ   it   s understand that the risk that are be taken make these contact increas nervous   in an environ of excess capac  these concern don   t suggest to me that we should chang polici in short order   but as i balanc the risk of slower than expect growth against the risk of fa  growth  rise cost  and financi instabl  i am more concern about the upsid   my view is that maintain a polici with interest rate too low for too long is in the end a bigger concern than the possibl of a widen output gap   to be sure  we have the tool to deal with either case   but i think the cost to us in term of credibl would be greater if the situat got out of hand on the upsid   thus  assum that the economi continu on track as project  i think we need to begin to reflect in our statement a willing to move the fund rate up   then at some point after that  i hope we can begin a gradual move to more neutral territori   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i think our district   s econom pictur is not unlik cathi   s   there is certain some good news in the latest inform we have receiv  both in the data and the anecdot report   activ continu to expand at a fair good pace as best we can tell  at least for now   manufactur  in particular  is in much better health now than it was a year ago   or even six month ago  i think it   s fair to say   we do a month survey  and it latest read indic that factori shipment and new order were veri robust in both januari and februari   consum spend has also been reason strong in this period  accord to both the month survey we conduct and anecdot inform  at our board meet last week  all three of our class a bank director indic robust growth in both busi and household credit loan demand   and one of our director  who is the ceo of a broadcast compani that has tv and radio affili not just in our district but in a number of major market area around the countri  indic that recent there has been a sharp upsw in ad revenu in her busi   so we current see some posit indic in our region economi in general  moreov  there is at least one posit develop in district labor market  which is that factori employ is now stabil after declin for mani  mani month   i made that point at our last meet  and as far as we can tell it   s still basic the case   obvious  though  after so mani month of declin  manufactur employ is stabil at a veri low level  and it is stabil onli  we don   t have ani evid at this point that it   s realli move up  more broad  i don   t have a sens of ani signific firm in the job market overal in our region  and i think that is begin to have a negat impact on confid   i don   t want to overst that  but i hear indic of this impact in some of the comment i am get from our busi contact  turn now to the nation economi  the soft februari job report got my attent  as it did everyon els   s   in all my year in this busi  i   m not sure i   ve ever seen a month report receiv more attent than that one   and it provid what may well be a healthi remind that this expans   not yet have full momentum  in fact  i think there   s some possibl that the momentum is diminish   the  book has revis down fair consider it project for real gdp growth for the first half of this year and to a lesser degre for the year as a whole   i think that was an appropri revis  given what we know now  and as a result the project output gap has increas appreci   the wider gap presum would put downward pressur on core inflat  other thing be equal  but the  book expect this effect to be offset in part by some spillag from higher energi price into the core inflat rate   of cours  the weaker dollar also probabl play into your overal inflat forecast     i think the wider project output gap is import  but i   ve alway thought that a realli import determin of inflat and disinfl trend in the short and intermedi term is unit labor cost   so  when i tri to assess the inflat risk  i tend to focus at least conceptu on some measur of the gap between actual and potenti employ and on whether that gap is narrow  stay constant  or widen   the last sever job report impli that the employ gap has been widen  given that job growth as measur by the payrol survey has fallen well short of most es  of the growth of the work age popul   the  book  sn   t report it es  of potenti employ and the employ gap  so i don   t know exact what the forecast impli for that gap as we go forward over the forecast period   the gap may narrow   but it   s not clear how sizabl the narrow will be if potenti employ is grow at someth like the growth of the work age popul  beyond this  as bill pool has alreadi note in his question  there   s a wide rang of plausibl es  of actual product growth over the forecast period   and obvious if product growth  sn   t slow as much as expect  the employ gap would be commensur higher for ani given growth rate of gdp   there is  of cours  the hope possibl that at some point rise product will produc a sharp further improv in expect of futur incom and that  in turn  will give an upward boost to the growth of aggreg demand   but i don   t see ani compel evid that this kind of shift has occur yet  so bottom line  i come out in the opposit camp from you  cathi   while the  book   s project of the growth of aggreg demand seem quit reason to me   and i think the staff   s overal forecast is the most like outcom   the labor market consider i   ve just summar suggest to me that we may not be give enough weight to the downsid risk on inflat   i think bob parri   s question had a sens of the same sort of concern  and if other feel that way  i would hope that we could find a way to reflect this in our polici set later in the meet
thank you  mr  chairman   my read is that  in general  demand is come in on the high side of expect   not dramat so but modest so   my wal mart contact said that he   not recal a  e in the last ten year when the situat was more confus   the intern data that wal mart has from the paycheck cycl and other inform suggest that demand should not be as strong as it actual is  with sale come in at a pace     to     basi point higher than had been expect   my contact said that they have reluct increas guidanc on sale to   to   percent  but they are nervous about that predict   he also said that price for general merchandis are fall at a rate of about   percent  but they had been fall at a rate of about     percent   so  price chang are still negat  on averag  but not by as much as befor  my contact in the truck industri said that the januari   februari period was much stronger than last year  the two month togeth were about   percent higher  and for februari busi was up   percent   the avail of driver is veri tight   he said that his firm is increas it capit spend this year over last year  plan expenditur are      million for      versus      million last year  probabl the most upbeat of my contact was from fedex   he said that they see a veri clear  progress strengthen of demand   year over year month comparison for it domest express busi thus far in      were januari  down     percent  februari  up     percent  and so far in march  up     percent   ground busi was up     percent in januari      percent in februari  and   percent in march   so he see progress strengthen there   he also report that the sale staff see the pipelin as full  with both current custom and new custom   fedex is now  for the first  e in a while  discuss expand it capit expenditur  they had expect their capit spend to be flat but are now talk about increas of    to    percent   he also said  in term of intern busi  that for the first  e in this recoveri period the year over year chang in u s  outbound traffic is now posit  he point out  too  that they believ they   ve about reach the limit of output increas with their exist labor forc   they anticip hire more worker  although they haven   t done so as yet  up did not have quit as robust an outlook  but busi is general stronger than they had anticip   one of the most interest comment i got from my up contact  though  involv the grow burden of secur relat cost   he said that he himself now spend about    percent of his day on secur issu  and a lot of his staff member are also veri much tie up with secur matter   the transport secur administr is dig in deeper with various requir   he cite as an exampl that their truck driver are now requir to   or are suppos to  anyway   lock the truck door when they go up to someon   s door to deliv a packag   that   s to ensur that nobodi drop someth harm into the truck while the driver is gone  i   d like to make a general comment on inflat   in term of the core inflat measur  obvious the idea is to take out the price chang that are temporari   but a good part of what we take out   food and fuel price   is not temporari anymor   the long run oil futur are up substanti over the last two year   by    a barrel or someth like that   for all practic purpos  that part of it  look forward  is now perman and not just temporari   there   s someth to that  i understand that   the food part of the inflat measur is heavili influenc  of cours  by the dollar becaus food involv commod that are trade in world market   and the best guess on the dollar is someth close to a random walk   i think one would have to say that the best project on the dollar is that it will remain about where it is now  though i know the board   s staff believ some further depreci is in order  as i look at the kind of thing we would identifi as inflat shock   where the effect should be about worn off   they are almost all in the same direct   some exampl  obvious  are fuel  commod price  health care cost  properti and liabil insur   a lot of compani talk about that now   and secur cost   all of these are shock  and they may be about worn off   but the fact is that they are all shock in the same direct  i don   t know of ani for which the price are move down   so i think we should not ignor the possibl that we have an inflat environ that   s gradual go to be turn more advers   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in the econom outlook for the third district sinc our last meet   the philadelphia staff   s lead index of econom activ are signal a pickup in growth in all three of our state over the next three quarter   current condit show continu improv in activ in most sector sinc our last meet   retail sale continu to rise at a moder pace in the district  but some of the improv in februari compar with a year ago reflect the damp effect of last year   s presid    day weekend snowstorm  residenti construct activ remain at a fair high level  although there has been somewhat of a pullback in the first few month of the year  which may be weather relat  commerci construct remain hamper by high vacanc rate in the offic market  but this is not a new develop   manufactur activ in the region continu to expand  the index of general activ in our march busi outlook survey  which remain confidenti until this thursday  will show a read of      percent  down from februari   s      percent but nonetheless indic continu expans  the more forward look index of new order and shipment have trend down sinc the post recess high of decemb  but they remain at higher level than dure the first     year of the recoveri   while the manufactur sector continu to expand  it is not yet creat job   despit the fact that the survey   s employ index has reach level that typic signal job growth in the manufactur sector  we explor labor market issu in a special question of our survey this month   near three quarter of the firm said that they had job open in the last three month  and three quarter said that they expect job open over the next six month   some of this reflect turnov  as about    percent indic that they expect a net increas in job over the next half year   near two third of the firm with open report that they   ve had difficulti fill these posit  and most said it was becaus of a lack of qualifi applic   this is a theme that came up in a coupl of place   obvious  there   s an interact between wage offer and labor suppli  but less than    percent of the firm told us they had troubl hire becaus applic were ask for too much money  and less than    percent report that the applic had anoth opportun   these result are consist with the view that at least some of the weak in the labor market reflect a structur chang  a skill mismatch if you will  in the midst of product increas and technolog advanc  the labor market remain the weak spot not onli in manufactur but for the district economi as a whole   the recent re benchmark of the payrol data has result in a downward shift in job level in pennsylvania and new jersey   instead of show an increas in job sinc the start of the recoveri  new jersey now show no chang  and pennsylvania show a sharp declin of     percent   i say    sharp declin    becaus that was befor i heard the declin in massachusett  which was actual rather startl   delawar has fare better   there was a substanti upward revis of job level in delawar  but still we have seen no job growth in that state sinc the recoveri began   overal  befor the revis  report job growth sinc the start of the recoveri had been slight better in our three state than in the nation   but the new data releas revers the rank  most as a result of job loss in the we n part of pennsylvania and in northern new jersey   at least i can still take comfort in the fact that we have not lag the nation as we did in the         recoveri   i think that   s one of the reason that my contact in the third district are posit and op ist about the recoveri this  e  turn to the nation  my overal assess of econom condit and the outlook for the nation economi has not chang much from our last meet   activ continu to expand at a strong pace  although employ remain soft   busi invest has strengthen  support by strong profit growth   consum spend continu to expand at a moder pace  thus  the recoveri is achiev more structur balanc  which put it on a more sustain foot   core inflat remain quiet in spite of commod price increas  the miss piec is employ growth  as mani have said  but it   s difficult to see how it can remain miss for much longer  given the pace of gdp growth   product simpli cannot continu to grow at the extrem rapid rate we have been see   my sens is that as output continu to expand  product growth will declin and employ growth will pick up to a moder pace this year   this is similar to the current  book forecast  which revis downward the pace of employ increas from the januari forecast   as is true for everyon here  i   ve been quit interest in gain more insight into the labor market situat   to that end i spoke to a larg payrol processor with a signific presenc in our district   the compani process    to    percent of all paycheck in the unit state and has as client a rang of differ size firm   their data on the number of pay process show that small firm  defin as have    or fewer employe  have been ad worker over the last six month while larg firm with over a thousand employe per firm have continu to cut worker   payrol at mid size firm have been about flat   the compani   s data also indic that wage growth has pick up in the last coupl of month and that the amount of over  pay has been rise   in the past  this pattern of employ and incom growth has been an earli indic of a futur rise in employ   certain  there   s some risk that it might not come to pass  but these are hope sign and a new data set to look at  even in the wake of the weak employ data  in my view the downsid risk to the outlook are consider smaller than was the case a year ago   and i continu to view the risk to output growth as balanc   in fact  if we had better employ number  i would be more concern about the risk on the upsid   given the current state of the economi and the outlook  i see no reason to chang our current polici stanc   but i   d encourag us to continu discuss the condit that would caus us to adjust polici and the step we need to take now to ensur that we have maximum flexibl to respond to chang event
thank you  mr  chairman   recent econom develop in our southeast region continu to be posit   retail are report that sale are still run well abov year ago level   our import tourism and hospit industri has improv further  and report are now quit posit  especi from south florida   unusu cold weather in the north has result in a larger than usual migrat of snowbird from canada  and a weaker dollar has s ul an influx of foreign visitor from europ   low mortgag rate continu to buoy our singl famili hous market   and we   re see small improv in select segment of the nonresidenti sector  main due to institut construct   while vacanc rate remain relat high in most of our larg offic space market  it appear that both offic and industri market have at least stabil  the sen ent of our region busi leader remain posit and upbeat  and we are hear some of the same report on capit spend  particular for softwar and equip  as are reflect in the nation data   our banker  unlik those in al broaddus   s district  are general disappoint that the busi borrow they thought they saw in the pipelin earlier in the year has often not materi   appar  much of the capit spend in our region is be financ out of profit  we cannot shed much new light on the disappoint employ pictur from what we are see and hear   most of the job growth we   re abl to track in our region is come from florida  and much of that is in low skill job in the hospit industri   a few manufactur firm report that they are ad to payrol   iron  and parallel the comment of cathi and toni  sever of our district director and small busi advisori council member report a shortag of high skill worker  such as engin and comput specialist   we even heard report of difficulti find good worker for minimum wage job in the servic sector in some area of the region  we keep look to our director and other contact for indic of imbal and price pressur that they might see develop  and we   ve begun to get hint of both   a number of folk are express grow concern about potenti overbuild and worrisom specul in the real estat market  especi in florida   entir condo project and upscal residenti lot are be pre sold befor ani construct  with buyer freeli admit that they have no intent of occupi the unit or build on the land but rather are count on    flip    the properti   sell them quick at higher price  the list of good and servic with outsiz price increas is begin to grow   in addit to insur and health care  which have been on that list for some  e  we   re hear about a number of other   builder have begun to complain about increas in price for lumber and other input   truck price are up in the aftermath of some shakeout in that industri and new limit on drive  e   the larg run up in steel price is t l down to end user  with some steel good now be price onli upon shipment   the higher oil and gas price are be pass through   my son  who is a residenti real estat develop  report that the cost of steel fenc post has doubl over the last year and that the price of asphalt is measur higher   he has now rewritten his lot sale contract to be abl to pass through such higher cost   one of my corpor director report that not onli has his use of audit servic near quadrupl but that the audit firm had the gall to rais it fee   cruis ship oper  even with all the capac they   ve ad in recent year  have report rais some price and scale back discount and deal   although these select price increas and the return of some price power in a grow economi are not expect to translat into higher near term inflat measur  it has been quit a long  e sinc i   ve heard so much chatter about price increas   i think it   s a remind that  as suppli and demand move back into balanc in sector after sector  we need to be alert  on the nation front  i remain veri op ist about the outlook   we do seem to be on a path with broad base foot  and good growth over come quarter seem quit like   our own var model are suggest growth close to   percent or perhap a bit less  even so  those forecast are still well within the new error band provid for the  book forecast   i would like to join other in applaud the staff for that refin in the forecast that come out of the  book  as most of us have suggest this morn and at other  e  the lack of more solid job growth is clear disappoint   while i think we understand and can explain to some degre the sluggish we   re see  it   s my sens that the error band around expect employ gain over come quarter are quit wide   my own staff is of the view that even the scale back es  and the later  e of job growth in the  book could still be a bit op ist  understand the implic of that for our forecast of gdp growth and for polici is import  among the longer term risk that i   ve emphas at other recent meet is the unsustain fiscal situat  which other have talk about and which is still not resolv   in prepar for this meet  my staff and i talk about the grow accumul of u s  secur by both the japanes and the chines  as note in the  book and discuss briefli this morn   as i understand the number  their hold now account for more than a quarter of outstand treasuri  and the pace of acquisit actual has quicken   it would be interest to hear some more discuss about how those purchas have interact with our own desk oper and the possibl implic for our polici and polici process should those govern slow down their purchas or let their hold run off as they matur  final  in line with my earlier comment about the select return of some price power as suppli and demand move back into better balanc  you won   t be surpris that i would judg the inflat risk to be balanc now   while we still have some uncertainti and some drag on activ to work our way through  we may not be abl to be as patient for as long as some peopl think   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  the tenth district has continu to expand sinc our last meet  and busi contact remain relat op ist about the rest of this year   consum spend and tourism have remain solid through the ski season and into this period   hous activ has eas somewhat  as is true elsewher  but it general remain strong in our region  manufactur activ also continu to strengthen  as product  new order  and employ all have risen   in other posit news  manufactur firm report a further increas in capit spend and in spend plan   and busi leader express op  about econom growth over the rest of this year throughout our region  with stronger feel in the ea n part   in kansa citi and that area   and a littl less op  in the denver area  commerci real estat has remain weak  and most firm continu to show less enthusiasm for new hire than for capit spend   there seem to be a sens that the cost of capit is less than the cost of labor and that  therefor  it make sens to go with the capit spend   i   ll give you one piec of anecdot data in support of that   locat in our region is a major distributor of propan across the unit state   they have use new technolog   call center  global posit  and communic technolog   to move their product from start point to distribut point   use this technolog  they are anticip  to begin with  a reduct of at least    percent of their driver and  longer run  as much as    percent becaus of the improv in move out their product   they came to the conclus that invest in this technolog produc a much greater return on capit than continu to oper in the old way   i think that   s part of what we continu to see in the job market   let me also mention that we are hear more anecdot report of delay in the abil to bring order forward   when firm order good to be use in manufactur  they are experienc longer delay in receiv those good   so in that sens the environ is fair strong in term of our experi with econom growth  at the nation level  activ continu strong   our project in comparison to the  book forecast has no major differ   on averag  for         we   re in the same rang of about     percent gdp growth   what i would say to you here   although i   m not advoc ani immedi chang in our polici stanc   is that i think condit are develop that could allow futur price pressur to emerg   first of all  both monetari polici and fiscal polici  as everyon know  have been deliv quit a bit of s ulus   as one person said     there   s a lot of yeast in this dough  and it   s move     i would also say that the anecdot report suggest that we are go to see more delay in deliveri   bar shock  obvious   and there is more talk of pass on price increas  that is becom much more preval than it was just two or three month ago  or actual even a month ago   so i   m wonder  in term of posit ourselv in the sens of our abil to move rate up  if be tie to develop in the job market is realli in our longer run best interest   we may have to be alert to this emerg situat as capit spend continu to bring us greater product increas   despit some view to the contrari  i think that inflationari pressur may emerg befor the job market turn around   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   the trend that have been evid in the district economi for some  e are continu  so econom activ is expand further   let me just start with inflat where  at least in our district  to date there seem to be few sign of ani broad base price pressur and no real concern about inflat  although there are some concern about price of particular product and servic   i   ll say a bit more about that in a minut  one distinct bright spot in the district is spend on equip and softwar   that has becom evid over the last sever month  and base on the anecdot report we   ve been get  the strength in such spend continu   interest  the state and local govern budget situat has not turn out to be quit as dire as earlier expect   that is due in part  of cours  to polici chang that were made and in some case to the fact that revenu are run abov earlier project   there is  howev  a transit strike under way in the twin citi  and the princip issu there seem to be benefit   especi who is go to pay for the cost of health benefit  both manufactur and mine in the district are expand  and employ is go up modest in those two sector   mayb more import in term of the labor market situat  there realli is littl talk from our sourc these day of further larg reduct in payrol  that   s certain consist with what we   re see in the initi claim data   so at worst  employ is stabil  at best  it   s grow in some industri   consum spend has been reason strong thus far this year  but peopl are get more concern about higher energi price  and the implic of that for home heat and gasolin bill may curtail discretionari expenditur go forward   so far  though  there  sn   t seem to be ani signific evid of reduc spend  as best i can judg   and final  in construct  hous   remain a bright spot in our area  as far as the nation economi is concern  i have onli a few comment to make becaus i haven   t chang my outlook for the nation economi at all   i believ the outlook is quit posit  and the incom data haven   t provok me to reassess that view   while i would describ the incom data on the nation economi as posit  they perhap are not as posit as some expect earlier   but i do think there   s a danger in over emphas high frequenc data   there   s a lot of nois in them   we   ve all had a lot of experi look at data that seem to tell one stori one month and a differ stori two or three month later  after some addit observ and revis   fundament  i think that the nation economi is in good shape and that we can look forward to good growth both this year and next  i have one final comment  and that is on the product issu   i   ve been suspici for some  e about the deceler in product project in the  book   it has been push off a bit   but to the extent that what we are see turn out to be more fundament   more secular rather than cyclic   the implic are either for the same growth in gdp and smaller employ gain or for more rapid growth in real gdp   in ani event  though  i for one hope that rapid product gain continu
thank you  mr  chairman   econom condit in the fourth district have continu to strengthen sinc our last meet   my busi contact are tell me that their order book are begin to fill up  and banker are say that their commerci loan portfolio pipelin are also fill up   the busi execut that i   ve spoken to sinc the last meet are still find excel opportun to increas product  and they are spend on capit equip with that goal in mind   as mani other who have spoken ahead of me alreadi said  most of the anecdot inform on capit spend is that busi are spend on comput  comput network equip  and softwar   howev  i just learn that a major steel produc is go to restart a basic oxygen furnac and continu ca  oper in cleveland to satisfi the grow global demand for steel   and it was onli four month ago that the domest steel produc were lobbi for an extens of steel tariff  other busi contact are tell me that it   s no longer possibl to scoop up at distress price some of the near new machin tool equip that   s out there   my contact seem to be say that all of the good bargain are now gone  in my discuss with district busi execut about their hire plan  i   m still hear a great deal of reluct to add peopl to the payrol   busi manag have becom veri adept at expand output without ad to the workforc  as other have said  firm are use new technolog and are redesign their busi process   and it   s not just that new hire add to wage and benefit cost   i   m hear execut say that  by hold down their head count  everyon in the compani is becom more creativ about way to increas product  larg compani   and increas medium size compani   are express an interest in and have more and more experi with outsourc to foreign supplier   in some case they are get manufactur compon from foreign supplier  but in other case they are get servic  such as softwar develop  call center  back offic oper  and even some research and legal servic   i  too  don   t want to make a lot of this or overst the amount of activ that is move offshor  but i am amaz at the number of new instanc i keep hear about  especi from medium size and smaller compani   what this grow volum suggest to me is that busi continu to feel intens pressur to rethink their busi oper   i believ that this kind of restructur we   ve been hear about is still go on  and i think it   s go to continu to boost the pace of product growth  i report at our last meet that sever of my busi contact were deal with rise price  and that trend has acceler   in most instanc the price increas continu to be in commod  construct materi  and metal   but i   m hear more report now that mani firm are abl to pass some of these price increas on  a point other have mention as well   even though we know that there has been littl effect from these price increas on good at the retail level  for the first  e i am hear peopl say that they are more will to contempl pass on some of these price increas   that suggest to me that this long period of disinfl we   ve been live through is bottom out   i know that in an economi where we think there is still a consider amount of slack it would be unusu for inflationari pressur to emerg at this point   howev  the rise price of commod  energi  hous  and health care combin with the fall dollar and a veri accommod macro polici have led to a situat that is begin to generat some concern among my director  and that also worri me   i do think that monetari polici appear to be on the right cours  but i hope that we   re not confront with a situat where our preoccup with weak labor market lead us to discount the inflationari signal that may aris   thank you  mr  chairman

mr  chairman  in front of you is a chart of the forward rate yield curv that you spoke about dure dino   s brief  the red line is the ten year ahead one year forward rate less the one year rate  and the black line duplic the line that dino show on his chart   and  yes  it is the case that the spread is quit high when we look at it in forward rate term  and the amplitud of the swing is greater     the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix
it   s interest that the red line in         is rise wherea the other one is flat  which of cours reflect our move the fund rate down   that alter the mean of the chart   anyway  governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   recent data have underlin the virtu of patienc in our current monetari polici strategi   demand has been strong    i   m about to line up against my colleagu to my right  so to speak   laughter  though not all of my colleagu   but it has been slight less than expect  and import that demand is feed through to the labor market even more slowli than anticip   one effect of this combin is to leav the economi with a somewhat larger es  output gap last quarter and this quarter and one that is close more slowli than we   d like   moreov  the declin in equiti price and the widen in a few risk spread indic some retrench in privat sector op   which is echo in consum confid survey and perhap  base on the inform that presid   provid from the busi peopl he talk to  in busi confid as well   one can   t help but believ that higher energi price  perhap terror risk  and job market weak are contribut to a slight more sober outlook   after declin for three year  under inflat may be flatten out  as the  book state  but the evid seem inconclus to me   the three month rate of core pce has come up  but from an extraordinarili low level  and core cpi continu to deceler  i agre with the staff that recent data and attitud shift aren   t surpris enough to suggest a chang in the basic stori   although hous has come off the boil a littl fa  than anticip  consumpt is onli a tad weaker than project  it rate of growth seem to be pick up from the fourth quarter to the first quarter   to date  tepid labor market  higher energi price  and low save rate don   t seem to be exert much restraint on household expenditur   most notabl  busi spend on capit equip remain quit strong  with no sign of taper off   and the pickup in industri product  still favor read from purchas manag  and sharp increas in commod price all indic that the turnaround in manufactur is continu  even if a littl less rapid than anticip   all in all  evid suggest that monetari and fiscal s ulus is continu to bol  privat demand  which with govern spend also rise should keep overal growth brisk   accommod polici should also narrow the output gap   and fa  than it has been   i don   t have ani new insight here   everi logic argument indic that a gradual strengthen of labor market should be in train  but we haven   t seen much of it yet  which in my view reinforc the argument for remain patient  nonetheless  some observ have been argu that our patienc should be wear thin sooner rather than later   one argument is that polici is veri accommod by histor standard and that mani of the reason for adopt such an accommod polici no longer pertain   demand has strengthen substanti  and the threat of pernici deflat has reced   a second concern is that polici accommod   and the expect that it will persist   is distort asset price   most of this distort is deliber and a desir effect of the stanc of polici   we have attempt to lower interest rate below long term equilibrium rate and to boost asset price in order to s ul demand   but as member of the committe have been point out  it   s hard to escap the suspicion that at least around the margin some price and price relationship have gone beyond an econom justifi respons to easi polici   hous price fall into this categori  as do risk spread in some market and perhap even the level of long term rate themselv  which mani in the market perceiv as particular depress by the carri trade or foreign central bank purchas  if major distort do exist  two type of cost might be incur   one is from a misalloc of resourc encourag the build of hous  auto  and capit equip that won   t prove econom justifi under more normal circumst   anoth is from the possibl of discontinu in econom activ down the road when the adjust to more sustain asset valu occur   neither of these concern  in my view  is suffici to overcom the argument for remain patient awhil longer  first  the current degre of polici accommod seem consist with macroeconom stabil and a sensibl approach to uncertainti   polici may be unusu accommod by histor standard  but those standard  for a varieti of reason  haven   t been a veri good guid to recent develop in that the stanc of polici has yet to result in a materi declin in labor market slack   and rapid product growth continu to hold down unit labor cost and inflat   uncertainti in the current situat seem greatest about the rate of growth of potenti gdp  as presid pool point out  as well as the level of the output gap and how the gap will be reduc  this uncertainti argu  in my view  for await firm and convinc evid both that labor market slack is on a declin trend that is like to be sustain after rate rise and that inflat has stabil befor consid polici action   the former will tell us someth about the relationship of demand to potenti suppli and the latter that the remain output gap isn   t that larg  second  maintain high accommod polici seem consist with a risk manag framework to possibl deviat from the most like outcom   the low level of inflat and the high level of the output gap mean that the welfar cost of econom growth run a littl stronger than expect are consider lower than the welfar cost of it run a littl weaker than expect  third  i believ that at least for a while the macro imper are like to outweigh ani threat to financi or longer term econom stabil from accommod polici   ani unusu distort in asset price that might intensifi a subsequ correct are probabl small  domest risk spread aren   t obvious too low for the begin of an econom expans  the upward tilt of the impli path of forward rate and note and bond yield look relat gentl   the level of those rate may be a bit low  but they don   t seem way out of line unless activ is much stronger or inflat much higher than i anticip   hous price are elev relat to rent   and will look even more so when rate begin to rise   but are more like to correct by rise less rapid than by crash   egg will get broken when rate begin to rise  but the capit in most intermediari is high  and the system is resili  while central bank in the unit kingdom and australia seem to be tilt polici in a firm direct owe to asset price concern  those economi are general oper at higher level of resourc util than we are  and their hous price inflat has been much higher than our   in our situat  a high burden of proof would seem to be on polici that would slow the expans  leav more slack and less inflat in the economi in the intermedi run to avoid hypothet instabl later   in short  cathi  i understand your concern  but until the labor market take a more definit and sustain turn for the better or until inflat look as if it trend has chang  i   d be quit hesit about allow such concern to have an effect on polici   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i   d like to compliment the staff on the new uncertainti calcul   it   s veri import to have them becaus without them one tend to measur uncertainti by compar forecast   sinc forecast talk to each other and probabl talk in term of mean  this what i   ll call    convers approach    great underst true uncertainti   now the staff is give formal statist es  of uncertainti   i like the graphic  too  becaus we have an es  of where the altern simul fit in these uncertainti bound  on the forecast itself  we may be get to the end of a swing of upgrad   for the past half year or so  most data have come in ahead of expect  and most forecast were steadili upgrad   this is the first meet in some  e where the  book has actual downgrad the forecast  albeit onli slight   the main reason  of cours  was a disappoint employ growth number  but some other indic are show a bit of weak as well   while the  book forecast have downgrad their es   the blue chip forecast are not there yet  they are still upgrad   this suggest a new way to evalu forecast   not onli in term of group mean squar error but also in term of how alert they are to pick up turn point  sinc i   ve been here  i have a general sens that those prepar the  book are pretti alert   much more so than the blue chip forecast   but this matter should be studi further  moreov  it   s way too earli to tell whether this recent downgrad is a mere blip or the start of someth more meaning   nevertheless  the new develop certain bear watch  sinc the basic econom situat is so littl chang  and sinc i speak after don who leav me veri littl new to say   laughter  there is not much to talk about here that has not alreadi been discuss mani  e over today or at a previous meet   let me focus instead on the macro implic of an issu that all of a sudden has becom hot polit   the potenti widen of the incom distribut  typic in recoveri  the incom distribut close  as lower incom worker gain more than higher incom worker   this  e it seem that the pattern will be revers  as inde it was in the      s   evid that the incom dispar will soon widen is all around us   profit are veri high relat to wage   the  book show that the price markup on unit labor cost is at a record high   the profit share of total output is at least at a cyclic peak  and wage growth remain relat sluggish   base on data now avail  i   m fair sure that incom dispar will widen signific in this recoveri   this in turn rais the question of what impact that will have   there seem to be widen dispar among household   from the financi statist we see that the wealth   incom ratio is rise  but the financi oblig rate remain high  and loan delinqu rate have risen to a local high   from labor statist we see that labor forc particip rate are drop  main among group like to be affect by the cycl  moreov  there   s a sharp rise in quit rate for those who gave up look for a job becaus they couldn   t find work   similar  the durat of unemploy is rise even as the overal unemploy rate fall   there is a similar incom relat dispar in consum sen ent  three year ago there was a   percentag point spread between consum sen ent of median incom famili and low incom famili  now that spread is closer to    point   near as much widen has been appar on the high side of the scale   whatev consum sen ent mean   and i have never manag to figur out exact what it   mean   low incom group now have a good deal less of it than high incom group by a veri great margin    laughter  while it is easi to find evid that incom dispar are widen  it is harder to identifi macro implic of this shift distribut   imagin first that a dollar has shift out of wage and into profit   the margin incom tax rate for worker is    percent  and the household margin propens to consum  mpc  is    percent   these  by the way  are styliz research and statist divis es    so the drop in wage would lower consumpt by about    cent   if the margin tax rate on profit is    percent and the wealth consumpt coeffici is       the    cent rise in profit would rais stock price by a littl over     and consumpt by about    cent   it   s a total wash   and it would even go the other way without the margin tax rate differ   one get similar result from a shift of incom within the household sector   margin propens to consum for differ incom group seem close enough that there is like to be littl chang in overal consumpt from the distribut shift apart from that due to differ in margin tax rate  so while it look as though a veri signific dispar in the incom distribut could open up  it is hard to find major overal macro effect from this sourc  apart from the unlik suspect of differ margin incom tax rate   at the same  e  these conclus are tentat  the intern group mpcs are not as reliabl es  as is the overal mpc  and there could be further effect on confid  social tension  or who know what els   here again the distribut shift are like to be larg enough that the issu bear watch
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll do this brisk  econom develop in the second district remain quit favor   busi and consum confid have weaken some  employ has fallen a bit  and in our empir state survey the forward look six month ahead expect show somewhat diminish op   but the number are still reason strong   manufactur report stronger pressur on input price  with particular concern in steel and energi  as mani of you have said   perhap more signific  they are report higher price receiv and expect of more price power ahead  the part of the new york busi and financi communiti with nation and global busi continu to report a reason posit view of the outlook   they are a bit more cautious than they have been  less becaus of concern about actual diminish growth in demand or profit than becaus of uncertainti about the sustain of the expans if employ growth fail to strengthen  the implic of the polit calendar on the econom polici debat  and renew concern about terror risk   greater confid in product growth is not leav peopl with as warm a feel about the futur as one might think is justifi  in our view  the basic element of the expans appear to be on the same path as they did at our last meet   with power support from the forc of monetari polici  accommod financi condit general  and the structur acceler of product growth  we expect the economi to continu to expand at a reason healthi pace for the next few quarter   consum spend may moder a bit  but real incom growth should continu to support expenditur at a comfort rate   we expect invest to continu to strengthen at a quit rapid rate  support by confid in demand growth  competit pressur to upgrad  ampl profit margin  and veri favor financi condit   we   ve move our forecast up a bit  but we are somewhat lower in term of gdp growth for      and      than is the  book   the main differ are in the expect path of consumpt and a larger negat contribut from net export   we see consum expenditur slow somewhat becaus we anticip a gradual rise in the privat save rate   we are more op ist about virtu   we are less posit about impetus from asset price  inflat  and interest rate   we also see product growth stay at a more elev level longer and fall less than   the board   s staff  and as a result we expect more moder employ growth   on balanc  though  we share the staff view that growth will continu at a level somewhat abov what we consid to be trend or potenti  in our judgment  the core inflat number are like to remain low  but we may now have reach the point where the rate of increas will stop fall   unit labor cost should start to rise modest as product growth moder  but the increas should be quit modest for a while   we suspect that the survey on price pressur and a grow abil to pass on those price increas mean someth in term of a diminish probabl of further fall in inflat  on balanc  we see the risk to this outlook for growth and inflat as quit close to symmetr   relat to our last meet  the chanc of a substanti upsid surpris on output growth seem diminish   and until we see employ growth strengthen and unit labor cost turn  there will continu to be some chanc of a further declin in core consum price inflat  even if   or when  i should say   those condit materi  we consid it unlik that inflat will acceler over the forecast period to a rang abov our comfort level  so on this basi  we see monetari polici as appropri calibr to these condit  and we believ that could prove to be the case for some  e   howev  the committe   s success in convinc market that it will be patient is contribut to condit in financi market that could caus us and the macroeconomi   and even don kohn    laughter  some discomfort   i think we should be uncomfort now with the extent to which expect of the turn in the fed fund rate have reced   with the overal risk close to balanc  we have less need for and face more risk in a communic signal that is still interpret as design to hold interest rate expect down well beyond the immedi polici horizon  this is not an encourag that we act now to dial back that signal   but we need to consid think about do it soon  if onli to increas our futur room for maneuv   thank you
in prepar for this meet  i focus again on busi c i loan  and for the first  e in the two and a half year that i have been follow that inform sourc  we are start to see some measur growth   it would be one thing simpli to report that  but it   s quit anoth  at least in my mind  to go back and think about how long it has taken for us to get here   when i first began look at these number  busi loan were in a declin  from a declin and a sens of veri negat feedback  they went to no new inform and then to earli indic of some bottom fish and option take   after that there was some talk of activ but no measur activ and then some activ but it was still not show up in the c i number   final it is in the c i number   in addit  we have gone from a  e when bank and the secur industri were clear cut back on market and on their paramet for loan approv to a point where they   ve becom veri aggress   so  i think in a real sens this measur reflect not onli the under economi but to a certain extent the psycholog  and as presid   and   have indic  there are indic that both have pick up  so if one were to use the trend in c i loan as a baromet  it would seem to reinforc the  book analysi of the strength in the under economi  with the lag in employ growth be the anomali   we made a signific shift in our communic six week ago when we move away from the    consider period    languag and express the need for patienc   it seem to me that patienc is still in order in our communic at this  e
thank you  mr  chairman   in my intervent here  i   ll talk about three thing   first  what has happen dure the intermeet period and how i interpret it  second  whi it has happen or what the hypothes are  and third  the implic in this room for polici  first  as all of you know  what has happen is that the data have been distinct mix  as i think   said  but somewhat on the downsid or at least below expect   three or four thing have caught my attent   obvious  the labor market number have been somewhat weaker than we anticip   import  though  demand for new vehicl has been a littl sluggish   dealer inventori seem to be rise a bit   i   m go to come back to talk about that a touch   and hous activ  while still strong  is also somewhat below expect  i think someon mention that there are those in the privat sector who put togeth someth call a    surpris    index   they   ve observ that  dure the second half of       the surpris index tend to be posit  which is to say that the data came in higher than expect   sinc decemb of last year the data  general speak  have come in below expect   so i think there is some warn sign there that either expect are far out of the line or the economi  while still strong  is not quit as strong as peopl had thought   the staff has taken this on board by mark down their forecast   the output gap is probabl up  and the employ gap is up   the main focus there  obvious  has been the question of job creation  which has been quit sluggish  so whi is it that  year after the formal end of the recess  we still seem to be deal with what appear to be yet anoth jobless recoveri   that lead me to topic    which is whi it has happen   there are a number of theori and hypothes  and i   d like to go through them quick   one is that the rapid increas in benefit cost has discourag busi from bring on new worker   i tend not to put a lot of weight on that sinc i think  by and larg  benefit cost are relat small compar with the overal cost of hire worker   but there probabl are some industri where that factor is import   the other hypothes that i   d like to spend a littl more  e on have alreadi come up  with one except   one is that structur product growth may be higher than we had thought befor   i tend to put a littl more weight on that argument   have look at some other period of increas in product growth  i think we   re in the middl of one of the strongest of those period compar with the other  histor they have run up to twenti year or so  and this one start about nine year ago  so i suspect there may be more to come here   one of the thing we may be see with regard to the stori on structur product is that it   s a littl stronger than we had origin thought   that said  obvious it will have to come off a bit for cyclic reason in order for job creation to pick up   so i lay that out as one option  toni mention anoth option  which is a bit of a mismatch in skill  and that again may lead to slower job creation  but the third possibl   one that hasn   t been talk about much   is this so call busi gloom   i find that gloom frustrat psycholog driven  but i think there   s an analyt underpin to it that we at least ought to take a moment to focus on   i have a concern that one of the reason busi are somewhat gloomi is that they are awar that much of the increas consumpt they   ve seen has been driven by s ulus and that s ulus is undoubt like to wane dure the cours of the year   that is certain the case for fiscal s ulus  though it   s hard to say with respect to monetari polici at this stage   but sinc the expect is for no further decreas in interest rate  i think most peopl would say that the s ulus from monetari polici also will start to wane a bit   in the context of that uncertainti  i think busi are concern about how sustain the growth in consumpt is go to be  they have been hold down hire and also labor incom   no one has focus on it yet  but while real labor incom increas in the fourth quarter of last year by about   percent over the previous period  that was the slowest quarter rise in labor compens last year   the rate of increas has been slow gradual dure the cours of       and that  i think  is a bit of a problem   i believ that has play into the relat weaker  though still strong  demand for consum durabl   both auto and hous   that i note earlier   auto inventori are start to build  and hous activ  while still strong  is slow somewhat  anoth point i   d make here is that the other factor that have been hold up consumpt  includ equiti wealth and home price  may start to soften over the forecast period   so while consumpt for household is still on a relat strong foot  i don   t see it strengthen   i think there   s a risk that it may weaken a bit becaus i suspect that all of the factor that have been support it are go to be weaker and not stronger go forward  that said  it   s clear the case that busi continu to fix their balanc sheet   and we   ve seen an increas in capit invest  which i think is part of the product stori   so i don   t expect thing to fall apart complet from the busi side   but i do believ there   s a bit more downsid risk than perhap other in the room feel there is  at least as i interpret the comment i   ve heard   don introduc the concept of announc how we   re line up   i guess i   m line up with the kohn   broaddus view that there   s perhap a littl downsid risk  now  let me go to the third topic   the implic of all this for polici   as i listen today  i heard two or three differ theme mention that i   d like to discuss   one is the issu of inflat and price pressur   i heard a number of stori about bottleneck  speed effect  and so forth   it struck me that primarili what we   re hear about are a few minor imbal in suppli and demand in a small number of industri that may not have the abil to chang their output as quick as other   but i   m not sure  in the context of a widen output gap  that those problem are like to feed into inflationari pressur that we realli have to worri about   i   m not deni that price pressur may be pick up in some area or that there are import market where suppli and demand imbal may be lead to price increas   but i   m not sure at this stage  in the context of a squishi   that   s a technic term i some  use    laughter  labor market  that we   re like to see a big pickup in inflat  a second theme involv the question of whether or not we are at risk of overstay our welcom at these veri low interest rate level   don obvious has done a superb job in go through the technic element of that  which i will not in ani way attempt to mirror   i would associ myself with those comment becaus don  after all  is a great former member of the staff and now a distinguish governor   but have said that  i would point out someth that hasn   t come up yet   that  in the staff   s most recent assess  the real equilibrium interest rate has come down somewhat   so while rate are at histor low  monetari polici may not be as accommod as we had thought   as i note  some imbal may be build up with interest rate this low  so we shouldn   t be complac about it   but we should recogn that monetari polici may not be as accommod as we thought  the third theme relat to communic   the point i   d make is that market are expect veri few chang   given how fragil the market are and given my view that perhap there   s more downsid than upsid risk  i would again caution that we be veri care about make ani signific chang in our statement   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i will align myself with the kohn axi
as long as it   s not an axi of evil
which propos that monetari polici patienc is appropri for current macroeconom condit   howev  the issu has been rais by vice chairman   and other that our current polici stanc may contribut to potenti financi imbal down the road   the histori of use the monetari polici instrument rate for correct financi imbal is a veri checker one  to say the least   so i think the question aris as to whether there is some other tool or instrument that we might use to approach the question of potenti financi imbal  and that   s what i   d like to talk about in my few minut  mani of the question and comment we receiv as fomc member have to do with perceiv and actual risk to financi stabil   just to take a few exampl  we have all on occas been ask whether there   s a bubbl in the market for residenti hous  whether the narrow of risk spread on corpor bond is justifi by reduc default risk or is instead the result of investor reach for yield  whether household and firm balanc sheet will remain strong when interest rate rise  what risk to the financi system are pose by the activ of the govern sponsor enterpris  and how basel ii and other regulatori develop are like to affect the structur and profit of the domest bank system   there are  of cours  mani other   such question are obvious import but are extrem difficult for each of us as individu fomc member to respond to  and certain not in detail   one   s inclin is to answer by paint a benign pictur so as not to caus unnecessari public concern   on the other hand  financi condit do chang  and it   s our collect respons both to monitor those chang and to communic truth to the public what we see  the central bank of most industri countri have respond to this challeng by issu regular report known as financi stabil report  usual on a semiannu or quarter basi   financi stabil report give central bank and relat institut a mean to provid systemat and object inform about financi condit over a rang of sector   i ask the staff to provid me with exampl of such report  and they quick came up with copi of report from thirteen differ institut   for the record  here is the list of major institut whose financi stabil report were provid to me by the staff   the bank for intern settlement  the intern monetari fund  the european central bank  and the central bank of australia  austria  canada  unit kingdom  finland  franc  germani  norway  spain  and sweden   all of these report are on the web  and i would be happi to provid url to anyon who is interest  these report are fascin read  and i commend them to you high   inde  most of them discuss the situat in the unit state as well as in their own countri   the materi cover by the various report is divers  as you may imagin  as is the amount of analyt detail   typic  howev  the report begin with a general macroeconom background and then present both data and qualit inform on the financi condit of bank and other intermediari  household  and firm   other section of the report discuss develop in secur market  intern financ  and aspect of the financi infrastructur includ regulatori develop   much of the materi in these report is in the public domain  but the report draw the data togeth and provid an analyt overview   in addit  box  research note  and even full length articl on special topic are includ   these report allow central bank to present their assess of financi condit in a way that is both object and respons to the concern and question of the public   by call attent to emerg financi problem  as well as by focus policymak    attent on them  these report may even help diffus potenti risk of financi instabl  it seem to me that we might want to consid the possibl of provid the public with some type of regular financi stabil report  perhap as part of the monetari polici report to the congress or in some other exist venu or perhap as a stand alon document   i suspect that much of the materi in the report would be easili obtain as a byproduct of regular brief in the  book cycl   howev  as i think under no circumst should we impos an unfund mandat on the staff  an assess of the margin cost of provid such report should be a key part of ani investig of the possibl   if there is ani interest in the group in pursu this idea either now or at some futur  e  i would person be more than happi to work with the staff to develop a more detail propos for the fomc to consid   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman  i want to start by also acknowledg the rang of forecast the staff has provid   i think it realli will help us be more awar of how variabl the outlook can be   as someon who spend a lot of  e worri about basel ii and advis banker that they need to understand the variabl of outcom  i   m glad to see we   re walk our talk and put it in our own fomc materi   so  thank you  sinc the last meet  as mani of you have said  the data have been mix   on net  our forecast is a littl weaker in term of gdp and employ  with inflat about unchang  overal the pace of the recoveri  while still strong  is slow   in look at this  i tri to focus a bit on the differ sector of the economi  and i end up spend most of my  e look at the corpor sector   as we   ve been notic sinc the second half of last year  corpor profit level are rise quick  and corpor cash flow is veri strong   in fact  intern generat cash flow has been greater than capit expenditur for sever quarter now   whi is it then that busi have increas their invest in equip and softwar but still haven   t pick up their spend in some other area   i think that this gap in spend on differ facet of their oper may come from a coupl of interest aspect of their financ   throughout this whole period  corpor have been pay down equiti on net  overal their balanc sheet have strengthen in leverag  but they are generat more profit than they can use and  therefor  are retir stock  anoth observ is that corpor net issuanc of debt has been quit larg until veri recent   in fact  the number in the last coupl of quarter are amaz to me   while a lot of debt has been issu  we   ve also seen  as governor olson note  a paydown in bank loan and commerci paper   so compani have been lengthen their liabil   take advantag of the long period of low interest rate to help strengthen their financi   in the last two month    data  howev  we   re see some chang   we   re begin to see for the first  e in a while commerci loan growth in the bank system and commerci paper growth in the financi market   there has actual been a net expans of debt so far this quarter   part of this may be due to the start of inventori build  but again  this has been veri  veri modest   corpor in effect are tri to maintain their high profit margin   in fact  from the data in the  book we can see that the street expect doubl digit earn growth for corpor out into the next coupl of year   to the extent that compani have veri lean  top line revenu growth   and particular with a limit abil to rais price to get that revenu growth   they are struggl to maintain the bottom line  one of the odd thing in corpor financ is that the wider your profit margin  the harder you have to work on keep cost down in order to generat earn growth   i think that   s in part what is happen now   firm are show wide oper margin to the street  the street is extrapol them into earn growth  and these firm find that they have to scrambl harder on the expens side   what realli make me uncomfort is that  of the govern sector  the household sector  and the busi sector  we have net save today in onli one sector  and that   s the corpor sector   until the corpor sector turn from a net saver to a net investor  i   m pessimist about get veri rapid growth go forward
thank you veri much   we   ll turn to   reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the materi that was just hand out   this is anoth meet about word  not action   your discuss about polici would seem like to center on how to character the econom situat and risk to the outlook so as to retain your flexibl go forward   as is evid in the current read on feder fund futur plot in the top left panel of the first exhibit  over the intermeet period market particip move closer to the staff   s assumpt that the fund rate will hold at   percent for the remaind of the year   inde  futur quot are now consist  as shown in the top right panel  with the onset of tighten be push back about three month   to some  near year end   this messag is similar to what primari dealer respond report to the domest desk in a survey last week  the middl left panel    all twenti three dealer anticip that the stanc of polici will remain unchang at this meet  and about one third expect no action until        the dealer appar do not anticip ani signific chang in the languag of your announc  either   it is also worth note  as in the middl right panel  that market particip are fair confid about the near term path of short term rate  at least as judg by the low level of volatil impli by option on eurodollar futur   this strong held sens in market that polici will be on hold for some  e  along with the phrase of the last announc   and the sens of quietud in mani of the telegram on the discount rate sent in by the board of director of the reserv bank in the past few day   explain the lack of polici altern in the bluebook  a document with the offici titl    monetari polici altern     to provid some perspect  the bar in the bottom panel pars the reaction in market at your meet over the past five year into that owe to the surpris on the polici rate and the residu  which presum is due to the word of your statement   the messag to take from the chart is that word seem to figur import as to how market react to your decis   you might think that we   ve taken that principl to an extrem in the centerpiec of the most recent bluebook  the tabl i   ve includ on the next page   the three column of the tabl present variat on the word of the announc accord to your view of the econom outlook   altern b  given in the middl column and explain in more detail on the next page in exhibit    suggest onli the most minor variat of the word that would be requir to squar the statement with econom develop over the intermeet period   to be sure  read on the economi of late have been disappoint  as is shown in the top left panel by the staff   s es  of the cumul effect on the two year treasuri yield of surpris in key econom data releas  similar to index of market    surpris    that governor    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix       mention   but the market reaction to such disappoint  on net  also produc  as shown in the top right panel  a signific declin in invest grade corpor yield that work to offset a declin in share price and an appreci of the dollar   thus  financi condit  on net  probabl do not differ much from those prevail at the  e of the januari meet   while encourag the expect of more accommod polici would support spend go forward  the lag in monetari polici might lead you to believ such effect would most be felt when the economi was in less need of support   as shown in the middl left panel  the period when ani action taken today would have it maximum leverag on the economi is next year  when the staff anticip that real gdp will be grow at   percent  follow this year   s project   percent expans   with inflat tame  the committe might feel that preserv current financi condit would best fo  the achiev of it object   such an attitud is consist with the assur made in the last sentenc of the januari announc  at the right  that the    committe can be patient in remov it polici accommod     an assur that market particip evid took to heart in shape their near term expect   if that is the case  as in the bottom panel  you could stress that spend is continu to expand at a signific pace   i   d note that the descript of the labor market in the second bullet is a littl differ from that in tabl   of the bluebook  the feedback i got sinc distribut the bluebook made me think that the committe would be more comfort relat that    although job loss have slow  new hire has lag     such an announc would like sink quick among the wave of econom news and be associ with littl market reaction  touch ani other element of the januari announc would probabl prompt a more sizabl respons  which is discuss first for an easier altern in exhibit     as is plot in the top left panel  the simpl summari of the  book is that the staff now believ that the output gap will run about    percentag point deeper than previous expect   that impli that about   percent of the nation   s resourc are expect to go unus at the end of        the fit perform of the labor market  seen by the shallow bar in the middl left panel  might pose a threat that outcom could be even wors than that   if household begin to doubt their incom prospect in the context of a poor perform job market  spend may not fare as well as in the staff forecast   the committe might put some weight on an assess of such advers altern   if the committe   s character of the economi lead market particip to expect a tighter stanc of polici and advers outcom for aggreg demand materi   such as a compress of household spend   the cost in term of lost output might well be higher than if the committe seem to be inclin to eas and the economi snap back quick   while investor do not expect action at this meet  to be sure  as shown in the middl right panel  the distribut of possibl for later this year impli by option on eurodollar futur rate has a notic portion of it mass below   percent   and more so than at the januari meet   if you thought that you like would be keep polici on the easi side longer than current price into financi market  the committe might want to highlight  as in the bottom panel  the darker shade to recent econom releas   in particular  it could point out  as in the second bullet  that    resourc util general appear like to remain somewhat below level consist with the economi oper at it product potenti for some  e    and could even tilt the balanc between inflat and disinfl more clear into the negat zone   while such a shift seem consist with the last few week of data  the committe might have more in mind the longer sweep of your policymak histori  as shown at the top of your last exhibit  the real feder fund rate has been negat for the past ten quarter   although a few staff model would suggest that the equilibrium short rate may well be negat   that is the lower bound of the blue region   you may well find it disquiet to be in an area travel rare by central banker who are favor rememb    laughter   moreov  the es  of the equilibrium real short rate deriv from financi market   the thin line plot the far ahead real forward rate deriv from quot on index debt   is now  and has been for a while  well abov the actual real short rate   a sens that the staff has a more benign view of the threat of a pickup in inflat than other forecast can be gotten from the latest blue chip survey of forecast  twice a year  the folk in arizona ask about expect over the next five to ten year for sever variabl  includ real gdp growth  plot in the middl left panel  and cpi inflat  plot in the middl right panel    as to the first panel  such far ahead project of output growth would seem to reveal privat sector economist    notion of potenti output growth   if so  forecast of potenti output growth  with a median of just abov   percent and span a confid rang from    to near     percent  might be read as suggest that pressur on resourc could emerg more quick than in the staff forecast   as to the second panel  and as presid parri note  despit the good perform of inflat over the past few year  longer term inflat expect may remain abov your longer run target and  judg by the dispers of the respons  may be less anchor than you   d like   word to express such cautionari note are given in the bottom panel  with the import chang contain in the paragraph assess the risk to the outlook   in particular  if you think that you may be more like to tighten than seem built into market price  you might want  as in the fourth bullet  to tip the balanc of inflat risk to neutral  from it current slight tilt toward disinfl  and qualifi your    patienc      the latter could be done  as in the last bullet  by note that    the committe recogn that the stanc of monetari polici has been quit accommod for some  e      that would like be taken in market as a marker that your patienc was wear thin
question for     i don   t have terribl much to say becaus as other have indic  most has been said   just let me point out a few issu   the rate of product growth is begin to slow  and over the last sever month  the high frequenc data show a mark deceler from the elev pace we saw earlier   thus far  howev  that slow has not been accompani by much growth in employ   so the issu is not whether the growth of product is fall  it is alreadi signific lower   the interest question relat to employ and whether it recent weak reflect statist nois or whether there   s someth go on that we did not anticip   i must add that an assort of recent labor market data suggest that there was a signific pickup in februari and march   if that is inde the case  it may be that the weak in januari and possibl in februari was due to weather relat problem  committe member have increas discuss the possibl that the persist of low market interest rate is fo  increas effort to reach for higher yield in financi market   in my view  this is probabl one of the most import issu confront us becaus  clear  the longer we maintain veri low interest rate  if inde there is signific reach for better yield  the more the liabil side of busi balanc sheet is go to be pepper with secur that may not be all that viabl in a rise interest rate environ   i   m not sure how we can evalu that risk  but it is an obvious issu that should be concern us   and i think that  more than ani other issu  is probabl what is go to move us eventu toward tighten  the difficulti that i have with tighten ani  e soon is that the economi may not yet have reach the point where we can confid say that this recoveri is fair solid and robust go forward  even though the current data clear are exhibit consider strength  ordinarili  i would have hope to move toward adjust our risk assess of inflat to full balanc in our press statement for this meet   the reason is that  if we are begin to contempl a tighten action  we should gradual de emphas our refer to patienc   a move in that direct today would be consist with continu to adjust our statement meet by meet and fo  a momentum that might enabl us at the appropri  e to tighten with a minimum effect on rate  my own judgment is that it would be desir when we move to have been so transpar about our intent to do so that financi market will not respond all that much  this mean that we have a veri interest but difficult job to do in tri to alter the general attitud in financi market   ideal  the day we move everybodi should have a sens that our action is consist with our previous statement about the outlook  this rais an interest question about whether we ought to be move toward a balanc risk statement on inflat or stay where we are   befor the data began to turn somewhat negat  i was hope that we could definit move in the direct of balanc  now i   m a littl concern about do so   the reason is that  if we move today toward balanc inflat  we will essenti have creat a sequenc of do someth   not tighten  but move in that direct   at everi recent meet   that would then creat a problem for us at our next meet if we don   t want to move at that  e   so  i am margin inclin not to chang our inflat statement at this point   but i must say it is a veri close call  the sole reason i would argu for not move is to avoid creat momentum toward a polici action if  inde  the econom expans is slow down  so i come out in favor of leav the inflat risk sentenc unchang   but if there is consider interest in chang it  i would certain want to consid the argument for do so   i do think we would be take a risk that i don   t believ we need to take at this point   in my view we are in a posit where we can sit with patienc for a consider period    laughter   i recommend that we chang the languag in the first oper paragraph of our statement along the line that   has indic but that we not chang the balanc of risk sentenc  what we have in the draft statement and what i   d like to put on the tabl for discuss is a first sentenc in the oper paragraph that talk about under product as provid import ongo support to the expans   that is not a chang   the second and third sentenc incorpor some updat   they read     the evid accumul over the intermeet period indic that output is continu to expand at a solid pace   although job loss have slow  new hire has lag      the fourth sentenc is unchang and read     increas in core consum price are mute and expect to remain low      that   s all i have to say at the moment   comment anybodi   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend for minim chang   i would  howev  move to balanc on the inflat statement  and i   ll tell you whi   in my view  that is certain an accur reflect of the probabl distribut   in fact  while i believ that the risk are close to balanc  my own judgment is that the probabl of a    point surpris on the upsid is a bit higher than that of a    point surpris on the downsid   i also think  though  that the effect of that chang in our statement is go to be total domin by the next employ report   we saw how larg the reaction was in the bond market to the februari report   if we have anoth weak job report   or whichev way the number goe   i think it   s go to overwhelm the effect of that minor chang in our inflat assess   in short  to me balanc is an accur reflect of the risk with regard to inflat  and i think the impact on the market of our state that is like to be quit transitori
i support your suggest  mr  chairman   i   m actual not altogeth avers to go to balanc on the inflat assess   but given that we   re come off a period of downgrad our forecast of econom activ  i think i   d rather leav the statement alon for anoth month   i   m not entir avers to that minor chang  howev  if that   s all we do
i just want to clarifi that i was not advoc that we move rate at this meet or even at the next meet   but i do think there are develop that we ought to keep in the back of our mind as we consid the stanc of polici   clear  there continu to be an output gap   and clear  the incom inform suggest that econom activ has been less strong than it was earlier  though it continu to be strong   and like everybodi els  i don   t know whi the pace of hire has been as slow as it has been or whether it will get slower or speed up more quick than we expect  i could go along with your recommend  mr  chairman  but i fall more into presid pool   s camp  and to some extent i agre with what ned just said   i   d rather say that the probabl of a rise in inflat is about equal to that of an unwelcom declin   use the phrase in altern c   becaus to me that more close describ what the market and other are see   i think it also convey a veri slight edg up in our concern   not a promis of a move the next  e or the  e after that or even the  e after that   about how long interest rate have been as low as they are   so  on the margin  i would come down with presid pool on this one
mr  chairman  i think it   s a close call on whether to balanc our inflat concern   but after hear your comment  with which i tend to agre complet  i have a slight prefer for stay where we are   i think we   re in a situat today where the fewer chang in the oper paragraph  the better
mr  chairman  i certain support your propos   i also think that it   s a veri close call with regard to the balanc on inflat   i must admit that recent develop in energi price and the valu of the dollar have led me to conclud that it probabl would be better to talk in term of balanc inflat risk   but for now  i could support your recommend   i think a chang in our statement about the inflat risk is immin  it   s just a matter of exact when it will be made
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  would have at least a mild prefer for go to balanc on the inflat risk   the reason is that  as i listen to the discuss today  it struck me that we heard more anecdot that seem consist with the possibl of build inflationari pressur   so on that basi  as well as other factor  balanc seem genuin appropri to me   that   s where i would come out on the issu
mr  chairman  i could support your recommend  but i share the view of presid  n and other in that the discuss around the tabl today sound  at least to my ear  as if we do see the inflat risk as balanc   in fact  i think we may have stay with the phrase    unwelcom declin in inflat    too long   those word in the statement don   t seem to be reflect of the discuss we had this morn   so i would have a prefer for a balanc risk statement on inflat   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   it will come as a surpris to no one that i have at least a mild prefer for stay with the inflat risk toward the downsid   in my mind  we haven   t yet actual seen evid   we have a lot of anecdot but no real evid   that inflat has even stabil   it is true that core pce has move up  though from extrem low level   but the core cpi continu to deceler even on a three month basi   so i   d prefer to be more certain that actual inflat has stop fall befor i can be convinc that the outlook call for move to balanc on the inflat risk  my second point is that i think we all expect total inflat to declin relat to last year  at least the fomc member project inflat of   to    percent this year  which is about    point less than it was in        now  a lot of that reflect a project declin in energi price  and perhap it   s not unwelcom  but the total is expect to fall  and final  from my perspect  in a risk manag sens  ani declin in inflat from current level   if it   s more than a tenth or so   is more unwelcom than ani increas   i think inflat is at such a low level that a declin has more welfar cost potenti over  e than a rise   i don   t expect much to happen  but in my cost   benefit analysi  the downsid risk get a littl more weight than the upsid risk
thank you  mr  chairman   i have just a coupl of point   first  i can support your recommend  although i had a margin prefer for the word    about equal      i think    about equal    is shade somewhat to the left of    appear almost equal      that is to say  we have lot of word in the english languag  and    about equal    is an epsilon to the right of    almost equal      my guess is that we could come up with anoth word if we want to  we could do this ad infinitum on a scale between    realli equal    and    sort of equal       laughter  so my prefer on the word is not a strong one  let me take this opportun  howev  to make a comment about the bluebook   one of the chang this  e in the structur of the bluebook was the elimin of the three option on chang in the fund rate   i think that made absolut sens  given where we are  but i also believ it could caus us a problem down the road   other thing be equal  i would prefer to have the three option present  and we can dismiss them if we don   t find them relev   i say that becaus i can see a world some  in the futur  perhap with a differ chairman  where there   s a minor view for either increas or decreas rate and the opportun to support such a move is made difficult if it   s not in the bluebook   this is not to take away from the obvious decis we   re make this  e   but as a general matter  i think that it make some sens to leav that structur in the bluebook and spend the extra page on it
mr  chairman  i also can support your recommend on the languag  given your comment that  if we make a chang  the market are go to view that as the first step in a sequenc and will expect chang at our subsequ meet   but i do have to admit that i also have a mild prefer for go to a balanc of risk on inflat   again  though  i can support your recommend on the languag
mr  chairman  i   d prefer that we move to a balanc statement on the inflat risk becaus i think the risk in fact are relat balanc now   but i would not choos to disagre with the stronger prefer that might be held by other around this tabl who believ that we realli should not be make a chang at this  e   that   s the more import decis at this point  i think
thank you  mr  chairman   while i am sympathet to the concern that other have express  my view is that we shouldn   t make ani chang  and i   d keep this slight shade in the balanc of risk languag as it is   i have that view for a coupl of reason  one is that the market seem to be expect veri littl chang and i see no reason to surpris the market by do someth els at this stage   last  e we made what to everyon in this room was a relat small chang   move to the    patienc    languag   to give us some flexibl  the market react quit strong   i   m not quit sure whi we have to do anyth like that this  e around   for reason that you point out  mr  chairman  we   re not exact start on a new path just yet  second  i would find it hard to explain  in the context of data that have been weaker than expect  whi the committe would alter it view of the inflat pictur in the opposit direct   that seem inconsist with some of the other languag chang we want to make  third  a point i made earlier  i think one   s assess depend to some degre on one   s view of where we   re start in term of the inflat dynam   as i said  i   m sympathet to the concern express about rise inflat  we   ve heard a lot of stori and anecdot about market where price seem to be pick up   but i   m not sure we need to start signal a greater worri about inflat at a point when our own forecast is for output growth to slow and for the output gap to widen   again  that seem intern inconsist   therefor  i would leav the word in the statement as it is  at least at this stage  and wait to see if the incom data tell us how the forecast might chang   if we wait until may to make this languag chang  i don   t believ peopl will think that we are behind the curv   so  for those three reason  i would support your recommend
first  mr  chairman  let me associ myself with toni   s comment about the bluebook   i also felt that it was veri well thought out this  e  but i would be comfort     by your put in all three option  which would indic that we   re expect to have action altern most of the  e go forward  on polici  mr  chairman  i may be an outlier even in the kohn camp   in fact  after i finish my comment here  i might be kick out of the kohn camp   i guess i have an extrem view  but let me just express it becaus i think it need to be said   as i look at the econom situat  it seem to me that the evid we have on the labor market to date suggest that the slack in that market is not diminish but increas   to me  that is fundament   i   ve been think about what is go to happen to the inflat rate and where the risk lie on inflat go forward   in my view don made a veri good point that there is limit evid  at best  that disinfl actual has ceas and some evid that it may be continu   i was also impress by roger   s comment in the econom discuss that  with the kind of imbal we seem to have  there is a likelihood of increas in some relat price   i don   t discount those price increas entir  but in this environ the risk that they will generat a quick acceler of inflat still seem to me to be less than it would be otherwis  so  i don   t think we   re give enough weight to the disinfl risk   after long reflect  i have conclud that we ought to give it greater weight  so i   m basic in an altern a mode   i realiz i   m defin the extrem of the rang of view here  but i wouldn   t be satisfi even with the languag in altern a as far as the assess of risk is concern  the statement there is that the probabl  though minor  of an unwelcom fall in inflat has diminish in recent month   i don   t know whether i agre with that   i   m not at all sure that   s the case  therefor  my own prefer   and  again  i realiz this is an extrem view   is  first of all  to get the possibl of an eas in polici in the statement  or at least to recogn that possibl   that has been off the tabl now for a long  e  and i think it   s  e to consid put it back on   so the way i would write the two sentenc  if it were my call  would be someth like this      the probabl of an unwelcom further fall in inflat has risen modest in recent week and onc again appear to be somewhat greater than the risk of a rise in inflat   consequ  while polici eventu will need to becom less accommod as the economi improv  somewhat greater accommod may be appropri in the interim
therebi make the chairman   s recommend seem terribl moder    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i appreci the anecdot regard price pressur  but i   m somewhat wari of them   i think mani of them reflect the salienc of the commod and energi price chang we   ve seen   but first  we know that those are a small part of total cost   second  there may be some confus between high cost and rise cost  and of cours  onli rise cost contribut to inflat  also  i want to associ myself with governor     s point that the news sinc our last meet has been primarili of a weaken in the expans  particular in term of the employ statist  and of a strengthen in the dollar  the latter has not been talk about a great deal  but the downward trend in the dollar has been arrest   so  mr  chairman  i would like to support the statement you have propos  with the bias downward  understand that we may well want to come to a balanc assess on inflat some  soon
i agre with your recommend for no chang in polici   i would prefer balanc risk on inflat   i think most of the weak we   ve seen recent has been on the real side rather than the inflat side   it   s just too much of a phillip curv type of analysi for me to view the two as a tradeoff in that way   i would even suggest chang the word    patienc    this  e   i agre with toni that there are a lot of word we can use  and i fear that if we start use that one  e after  e  we ll get in the same bind we did with the    consider period    phrase  so  i would be happier if you had found a word that was equal as strong as    patienc     i think it would be help just to chang that word so we don t get lock in   back when i play tenni  if you were about to receiv a serv  you didn   t stand flatfoot   you would keep move your feet so you   d be abl to go either way   and i think the word    patienc    leav us flatfoot
mr  chairman  i   m comfort with your recommend both on polici and on the statement   i think it   s true that the anecdot inform on price is wors sinc our last meet   but the number haven   t move   and our statement alreadi read that the risk on inflat are quit close to balanc      almost equal    is quit close    laughter   on that basi  i   m comfort with the suggest you propos
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  and i would prefer to keep the slight bias emphas that there is a possibl of disinfl   one of the thing that make me uncomfort about make a chang   go back to my comment that i like the fan chart   is that inflat is    fan    around   percent  and i person think   percent is a low number   also  there are econom consequ of what is go on   how compani manag their earn statement and how financi institut oper at extrem low interest rate have implic for the economi   that  plus the fact that we haven   t seen in the data actual evid of a stabil in inflat  lead me to prefer to retain the bias toward weak
mr  chairman  if it is a close call as to whether or not we would bring the inflat risk into balanc   and i think it is a close call   then i have a strong prefer for chang the statement as littl as possibl   it seem to me that  in the past when we have made signific chang in the statement  the market has overread their signific and has been confus about what we were tri to communic   the chang that have been propos for the statement today in my view reflect the minim chang in the outlook that has taken place in the intermeet seven week period   and i think we ought to go with a statement that suggest that the outlook has chang onli minim   so i support your recommend
this is a veri close decis actual   not so much in the number but in the fact that all of us  as best i can judg  could go either way if we had to   it   s just too close to call   i think governor olson probabl correct summar where we stand  and there   s a lot to be said for presid pool   s argument that it   s realli not go to matter all that much becaus what will matter is what the data show   so in a way i think it   s probabl best for us to do noth and let the market essenti move the expect on the feder fund rate   therefor  let   s have a statement read that essenti involv no chang
i   ll begin with the direct word  which is at the bottom of page    in the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with maintain the feder fund rate at an averag of around   percent      move on to the risk assess  which is part of the formal vote  that would be the languag under    b    on page        the committe perceiv that the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of sustain growth for the next few quarter are rough equal   the probabl of an unwelcom fall in inflat has diminish in recent month and now appear almost equal to that of a rise in inflat   with inflat quit low and resourc use slack  the committe believ that it can be patient in remov it polici accommod
sinc we will be approv the statement as well  could you distribut the draft statement  pleas  just to be sure   it   s in effect what   had indic  so i trust there are no surpris    paus   if there are no comment  pleas call the roll
chairman  span vice chairman    governor bernank governor bie   governor    governor   presid hoenig   governor kohn  presid    governor olson presid pianalto   presid pool             yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
we now have to go back to the agenda item we defer at the begin  which was a discuss of the minut of the previous meet   there were import issu rais      do you want to comment
in retali for the hard question presid parri has ask the staff over the year  i will be delay the start of his lunch    laughter   in do so  i   ll be refer to the memo i circul last night   comment on the januari draft minut  one policymak suggest trim the first four paragraph cover the committe   s discuss of it communic polici   four other recommend that onli paragraph    which review issu relat to expedit the minut  be shorten   i   ve includ the full set of comment begin on the second page of the memo  show potenti addit in bold and potenti delet as bracket materi in ital   not to sound defens  i start draft the minut on the assumpt that you intend to be transpar about your discuss of transpar   provid a full and accur record of the meet seem to requir describ the differ aspect of your discuss about the risk assess  the minut  and econom forecast   to my mind  the contribut of paragraph   was to lay out the pros and con of expedit the releas of the minut   in particular  the argument against elev the role of the minut  includ feedback on the committe   s deliber   which have not previous been well articul in the public domain   that said  two chang do seem appropri   for one  the last sentenc of the first paragraph   that   s line   through     concern the work group  which was direct sole to arriv at formula languag for the risk assess   that sentenc would seem to be posit better in the second paragraph  which is center on the risk assess  so that peopl do not read too much into the work group   s format and dissolut   for anoth  the last sentenc of the third paragraph   line    through      suggest that it was prematur to expedit the minut  seem to impli that at some point the minut would be expedit   on further reflect  the one side natur of that statement appear presumptu about your futur decis  suggest that a more neutral descript would indic that you have not reach a decis   i believ that cover four out of five of the object on that part of the minut   the rest of the possibl chang have polici import  which is whi i   m come back to the committe   in particular  do you want to shorten the descript of your discuss about the formula for the risk assess  the minut  and the econom project   you might favor such a cut on the ground that it   s not worthwhil to talk about procedur issu in public   but the main point have most alreadi made it into the press  and this offer you the opportun to frame the main issu in a balanc way   i would also add that reduc the discuss to it bare bone would offer more than a few comment the opportun for ironi about the committe   s view on transpar  someth i certain wouldn   t pass up   if you do  i take that as direct on prepar the next set of minut   that is  i should downplay today   s discuss of your prior discuss of transpar    laughter   let me close with this observ   given your decis to experi with acceler the product of the minut  you will not have the luxuri of an extend discuss of the minut for this meet and those for the remaind of the year
let me first follow up on your transpar assess   i think cathi   has rais an interest point   i would say this   we run the risk  by lay out the pros and con of a particular argument  of induc peopl to join in on the debat  and in this regard it is possibl to lose control of a process that onli we fulli understand   we have a ratchet in here where  if we were to move forward  we can   t go back   so the concept of transpar is a veri import concept but one that should be approach with a recognit that we cannot move back and forth on it   i   m a littl concern here that by rais certain issu we may not be abl to backtrack   i hadn   t thought about it when i origin read the draft minut  but in see the concern that other peopl had  i think there   s someth here that we have to consid   i do not recal so mani peopl rais question about the minut befor becaus i think most of us read the minut passiv   that suggest to me that  if there were realli a strong focus on them  we   d find a greater degre of disagr among us about their content   now  i don   t know whether what i just said is true   i suspect it is just on the basi of my experi   what was it   four or five peopl who comment
i was not one of them  so i would make the count six   it would be use to discuss this even at the expens of delay our tribut to our guest of honor   is that what we   re call you today
the old guy
anybodi have ani thought on this   i must admit that i didn   t think about some of these issu until i saw the comment other made  but i   m a littl concern about other peopl get into the debat when they know far less than we do   i don   t know what michell has to say on this but my impress is that  if we go in that direct  we may find ourselv come to a conclus that is not base on our best judgment   she   s nod in agreement
mr  chairman
i do have a concern about paragraph     it   s not just a question of hide or reduc the inform avail  i think that paragraph actual misrepres the substanc of the convers in that it seem to suggest that the reason for not releas the minut earlier is pure logist  which is certain not correct   there were argument of substanc on both side  and to suggest that the argument against are pure logist risk give the impress that our conveni is more import than reveal inform to the market
may i make a suggest   this could get to be a veri long discuss  and we don   t need that   do you have  e to make chang
i have all the  e you want   the committe  howev  will have to vote on the minut
oh  i understand that   let me make the follow suggest   those who haven   t comment should provid comment to     the reason i say that is that we may veri well find that those who didn   t comment actual strong support the minut as written  and it   s import to know that   we could then do   we   ve done this on numer occas on other matter   a notat vote   if there is a problem in tri to find out who is where or what the issu are    can get on the phone and talk to each of you and make a judgment   in my view  that   s the best way to resolv this  and i think it   s worthi of be resolv   it   s an import issu
for the reserv bank member  this will be the first experi with notat vote electron   you   ll have to do that kind of vote in two week anyway for the minut of this meet  which we will be circul at that  e
okay   ani comment relev to this
i have a question   we log in our prefer to    then what   he write down as the final word  the major vote
he will tri to infer from your comment  and i think we all trust him in this respect  a way to rewrit the minut that he think will gain a major vote  then we will find out whether he is accur    laughter
a quick question prompt by     s last comment that we won   t have the luxuri to have this type of discuss in the futur   a coupl of meet back  when we were talk about expedit the minut  you suggest that one way to deal with resolv comment to the secretari was to have a subset of the committe to help with the edit   are we go to talk some more about that   as we go through this experi  are we go to use that kind of process  or are we simpli go to leav it entir to
no  at this  e the onli thing   will be involv with is final the minut for the previous meet   that has noth to do with how we proceed go forward on this
presid guynn  in the experi with expedit the minut  we   re go to post draft of the minut everi even so you   ll be abl to see how the comment evolv   then we   ll deal bilater with committe member if peopl have specif comment   when we talk about the possibl of form a subgroup of the committe  we ran into the legal issu that the fomc cannot deleg matter of monetari polici   if the minut are view as a part of monetari polici  you can   t
will we see each other   s comment   this is the first  e i think we   ve ever had the luxuri of see who made what kind of comment   will we see each other   s comment  and by attribut  in the futur
now  wait a second   may i ask a question   if we have a subcommitte that is put out a draft of the minut to be vote on  none of us is in ani way forgo our legal commit   it   s the deleg of the vote that   s the legal issu   a subcommitte to facilit that process is  in my judgment   i don   t know what the general counsel has to say on it
i thought that   s what you suggest in earlier convers  the idea was to have some group look at the comment on the staff   s draft and make some share judgment about whether the suggest chang should be made
it  sn   t matter how it   s done becaus the ul  decis is made final by a notat vote   on this one  i think it   s probabl not necessari to appoint such a group  but that  sn   t chang the previous discuss
ani further comment   if not  the next meet is may    end of meet
