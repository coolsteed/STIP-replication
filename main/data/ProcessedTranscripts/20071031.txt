thank you  mr  chairman   i am go to miss   as my fellow scribe at the bis   she also was the person who identifi who was actual speak    laughter   two crosscurr have domin financi market sinc the

high yield debt has increas   on the other hand  those area more close link to the u s  hous sector remain under pressur   this includ the subprim mortgag market  the mortgag back secur market  and financi entiti   such as mortgag and financi guarantor   that have signific exposur to these asset class   the tension between the improv abil of investor to discrimin among riski asset versus the

price of the lower rate tranch have continu to plung in respons to rise delinqu rate for subprim loan and the virtual shutdown of the subprim mortgag market   in contrast  the perform of the aaa rate tranch has held up better  especi until veri recent   this suggest that investor are more care distinguish between the implic of widespread subprim loss for those tranch  such as aaa  that are in a

confid in this product as market price have plung and the rate agenc have begun to cut their rate  often veri sharpli  on mani outstand cdos   market particip are more will to buy corpor debt for three reason   first  the under fundament in the corpor sector remain good   second  the under asset are much easier to valu   third  investor are more will to trust the credit rate in this area   the rate agenc model have been battl test over a much longer period and have been shown to be robust across a broad rang of environ   in contrast  the abil of bank to securit nonconform mortgag loan remain impair   nevertheless  spread between jumbo and conform mortgag loan rate have come in a bit  see exhibit      this may reflect diminish pressur on bank balanc sheet from other sourc   overal  term fund pressur for bank have diminish as bank have gain greater clariti about their futur fund need and the need for excess liquid has diminish   nevertheless  term fund pressur still persist   as can be seen in exhibit    although the spread between one month libor and the one month overnight index swap rate and three month libor and the three month overnight index swap rate have narrow  these spread remain high relat to the level of spread evid at the begin of the summer   exhibit   show the same spread for europ   they have also come in but remain higher than normal   although the credit default swap  cds  spread for the larg invest bank and the larg commerci bank narrow follow the last fomc meet  much of this improv has been revers over the past two week as the hous outlook has deterior further and as the earn announc for sever major financi institut have disappoint investor   similar  the cds spread for mortgag insur and financi guarantor have widen   these cds spread are shown in exhibit     the broader bond and equiti market have general shown improv   in the fix incom market  credit default swap spread have fallen somewhat for the high yield debt market  see exhibit

of equiti analyst for      have declin onli slight  and the declin in      has been offset by an upward revis to      earn es   see exhibit       moreov  the demand for downsid protect in the equiti market has diminish   exhibit    examin the relat cost of buy a put versus a call   a posit skew is consist with a greater cost of downsid protect   although a signific posit skew persist  it is now much lower than it was immedi befor the septemb    fomc meet   exhibit    and    summar the incomplet transit away from risk reduct behavior by financi market particip   exhibit    show the correl of daili price movement and yield chang across the differ asset class for the  e interv between the august and the septemb fomc meet   as can be seen  the correl were veri high   indic that risk avers was the domin impuls among investor   with most of the correl over this period exceed an absolut valu of       these are shade in blue in the exhibit   in contrast  the same correl sinc the septemb    fomc meet  shown in exhibit     have come down but remain much higher than dure the first half of the year   two other market develop deserv a brief mention befor i turn to dealer expect concern monetari polici and a brief look at inflat expect  first  crude oil price have shot higher   there is consider disagr among market particip about how long the higher price will last and the factor behind the price surg   although some argu that it is specul  other point to more fundament driver such as inventori drawdown  geopolit uncertainti  and dollar weak   regardless of the caus  the effect on the macroeconomi has been modest up to now becaus higher crude oil price have not fed through meaning into product price   that is becaus the so call crack spread   the margin between the valu of the refin product produc from that crude oil and the cost of crude oil suppli   has come down sharpli  as shown in exhibit      the narrow of the crack spread impli that further increas in crude oil price  if forthcom  would like feed through into product price   second  the dollar continu on it gradual downward cours   although the dollar has reach new low against the euro and the canadian dollar  the overal pace of the declin as measur by the broad trade weight index has not chang much from the trend exhibit earlier in the year  see exhibit       the dollar   s trajectori still appear to be driven main by interest rate differenti   this can be seen in exhibit     which show the dollar versus the euro relat to the eurodollar   euribor interest rate differenti   moreov  there is littl evid that the dollar   s slide has made investor less will to particip in the long end of the u s  bond market   you can see that by the fact that u s     year treasuri note yield are still fair low  trade around     percent   market expect about monetari polici have shown consider variabl sinc the last fomc meet   exhibit    track the impli probabl of differ target rate outcom at this meet calcul from the option price on feder fund futur contract   as can be seen in the exhibit  the probabl of a    basi point cut has fluctuat in a wide rang   the most recent survey of primari dealer  conduct ten day ago  show a slight tilt toward a    basi point cut at the current meet  with eleven dealer expect a    basi point cut  nine expect no chang  and one expect a    basi point reduct   sinc that  e a number of dealer have shift camp   current  a more inform survey by the desk indic that nineteen out of twenti one dealer expect a    basi point rate cut at this meet   exhibit    and    show the primari dealer forecast for the feder fund rate befor the septemb and the current fomc meet   as can be seen  the dealer    forecast for the feder fund rate path are current a bit lower than befor the septemb    meet   partial reflect the fact that the fomc eas of    basi point at the septemb meet was of greater magnitud than the cut embodi in the averag dealer forecast   also  the gap between the dealer    forecast and the expect embodi in market rate has narrow over the past six week   as can be seen  consider disagr about the rate path remain   one year out  the dispers of the modal dealer forecast remain veri wide   inflat expect increas follow the    basi point rate cut in septemb   howev  the degre of widen is sensit to how the forward breakeven inflat rate is calcul   exhibit    show the five year  five year forward impli inflat rate as es  by the board staff versus the five year  five year forward breakeven inflat rate as es  by barclay bank  a major particip in the tip market   as can be seen in the exhibit  typic these two measur move togeth   more recent  howev  they have diverg a bit  with the board staff measur show a more persist increas follow the septemb fomc meet   the two measur differ in the secur that they use to compar nomin versus inflat adjust yield   with the board staff use a smooth yield curv base on off the run nomin treasuri and the barclay measur use the on the run nomin five year and ten year treasuri note to compar with the five year and ten year tip note   howev  liquid differ among treasuri secur are hard to model   as a result  it is difficult to be confid of the accuraci of such adjust   this argu that one should not complet dismiss the barclay measur when the two measur are behav differ   this might especi be true when no rise in long term inflat expect is evid in other measur  such as the univers of the michigan   s survey of consum sen ent or the desk   s own primari dealer survey   final  i want to discuss briefli the desk   s perform in implement the fomc   s direct from the last meet for a      percent feder fund rate target  in this respect  let me make two observ   first  in contrast to the previous intermeet period  in which the effect rate trade below the target for much of the period  the averag effect rate has been extrem close to the target sinc the septemb    meet   exhibit    show the cumul effect rate relat to the target sinc the last meet   second  as shown in exhibit     there has still been more day to day volatil in the feder fund rate than earlier in the year   this pattern like reflect sever factor  includ the demand by european bank for fund earli in the day and the reduc spread between the discount rate and the target feder fund rate  which has alter the bank    demand for reserv balanc   there were no foreign oper dure this period   i request a vote to ratifi the oper conduct by the system open market account sinc the septemb    fomc meet   of cours  i am veri happi to take question
thank you veri much   are there question for bill   no question   okay   then  may i have a motion to ratifi
without object   thank you   a veri thorough brief  i don   t know if we will have the same luck over on this side    laughter   let me turn to dave   to begin the econom situat report
thank you  mr  chairman   from a forecast perspect  it   s been a pretti wild ride over the intermeet period  with our outlook for activ shift sharpli at various point in the process in respons to larg swing in the stock market  the exchang valu of the dollar  and the price of crude oil   a coupl of week ago  with the incom data stronger  the stock market up substanti  and the dollar down notic  we were look at a forecast that had econom growth move materi abov potenti later in the project period   it appear that  after take you for a tour of the sausag factori in my septemb brief  i would need to issu a recal of that last batch of sausag even befor the arriv of their typic short expir date   in the event  the stock market retrac most of it earlier increas  and some of the improv in financi condit that had occur immedi follow the septemb meet was subsequ revers  as a consequ  our forecast chang relat littl  on net  over the past six week   the growth of real activ is higher in the near term  but in      and       the s ul effect on gdp growth of the lower dollar are offset by the restraint on incom and spend impos by the higher path for oil price   we expect the growth of real gdp to slow from a    percent pace this year to a    percent pace in      befor edg back up to a    percent rate in        the period of below trend growth late this year and next year result in some eas of pressur on resourc util  and core inflat move rough sideway at just under   percent over the forecast period   to my mind  recent develop rais three big question about our forecast  first    the broad base strength that we have seen in the data on spend and activ over the intermeet period suggest that we have overes  the restrain effect on aggreg demand eman from the recent financi turbul   second  is the staff miss sign of greater restraint on aggreg demand that will weigh more heavili on activ in the period ahead   final  with oil price up sharpli  the dollar have depreci  and resourc util a touch tighter  whi is our forecast for core inflat about unchang   let me start with the question about whether the strength in the incom data cast doubt on our es  of the restrain effect of financi turbul   there can be littl deni that  almost across the board  the read on econom activ have been stronger than our expect in septemb   in term of domest spend  the largest upsid surpris have been in consum spend  and much of the upward revis reflect data on activ after the financi turbul had alreadi begun   overal consum spend was stronger than we had expect in august  and the avail inform on retail sale and on sale of motor vehicl suggest that real pce exceed our expect for septemb as well   at this point  we know veri littl about octob   chain store sale have soften somewhat but onli by enough to make us comfort with the meager month gain in spend that we are project for the fourth quarter   our discuss with the automak suggest that sale this month have remain reason steadi   all told  third quarter growth in consumpt look stronger than we had expect  and spend appear to be head into the fourth quarter with a bit more momentum   in the busi sector  stronger purchas of motor vehicl led us to rais our forecast of equip spend in the third quarter   the other compon of e s came in close to our expect  though last week   s data on order and shipment of capit good  which we receiv after the  book was complet  were also a bit stronger than we had anticip   the incom data on construct put in place are consist with our project sharp slowdown in the growth of nonresidenti structur after a surg in the second quarter   but even here  the data have outflank us to the upsid  with surpris strength in commerci construct  factori build  and telecommun structur   taken togeth  stronger consumpt and invest account for onli about half of the upward revis that we made to real gdp growth in the third and fourth quarter   the extern sector account for the other half   in particular  continu a pattern we have seen dure much of this year  the growth of export onc again exceed our expect   we es  that real export increas at an annual rate of near    percent in the third quarter  about     percentag point abov our septemb forecast  and we have mark up export growth in the current quarter as well   the greater strength in both foreign and domest demand led us to revis up the growth of real gdp in the second half of this year about    percentag point  with annual growth rate of    percent and     percent in the third and fourth quarter  respect   so  do these fair broad base upward surpris in spend and activ suggest that we overreact in the extent to which we mark down our project in respons to the recent difficulti in financi market   it certain seem a legi  possibl  howev  we think it would be prematur to make that call   as bill note  financi market condit have improv somewhat over the intermeet period but remain far from normal   in term of credit provis  the senior loan offic opinion survey reveal a sharp jump in the fraction of bank report tighter term and standard on loan to busi and household  a develop consist with the restraint on spend that we have built into our forecast   consum sen ent remain depress relat to overal econom condit  perhap becaus of worri about financi develop   for now  although we have slight trim the magnitud of the turmoil effect on aggreg demand  the more import adjust in this forecast has been to push more of the restraint into next year   at the other end of the spectrum of worri is the second question that i pose earlier  have we miss some signific sign of potenti econom weak in the develop of the intermeet period   financi market particip seem to have react to the news of the past six week by mark down the expect path for the fed fund rate  wherea our forecast and polici assumpt are near unchang   is it possibl that we are miss sign of an impend downturn in aggreg activ   of cours  the prudent and accur answer to that question is alway    yes      but if that turn out to be the case  it won   t be for lack of attent   at present  it is difficult to find evid in high frequenc indic that the economi is in the process of turn down  initi claim for unemploy insur have remain relat low  motor vehicl sale are report to have been well maintain at least through mid octob  commod price are firm  report from purchas manag continu to suggest modest expans  and few anecdot outsid the hous sector sound as though we   ve move past a tip point   if we are miss someth import  it seem more like to me that we could be face a more grind period of subpar econom perform associ with a deeper and more protract adjust in the hous sector   it might seem a bit surpris to point to hous as a major downsid risk when this has been one aspect of our forecast that was right on the mark over the intermeet period  we had expect steep declin in sale and start  and that is what we got   but i would counsel you not to take too much comfort from that observ   in our forecast  we expect sale and start of new singl famili home to declin anoth   percent befor bottom out around the turn of the year   the project configur of start and sale is consist with a dropback in the month    suppli of unsold new home from an es  peak of     month earli next year to     month by the end of        residenti invest continu to fall through the middl of next year and onli edg up thereaft   but it is not difficult to envis a more pain period of adjust   we know a huge inventori imbal still exist in the hous sector   if  in respons to that imbal  hous price regist steeper declin than the one we are forecast  prospect purchas could experi an even greater fear of buy into a declin market  reinforc the hous sector   s drag on aggreg activ   moreov  sharpli lower price could have more serious implic for the abil of household to refin exist mortgag and could impair the perform of mortgag market more broad   those strain  as they have in recent month  could spill over into other area of the financi market   as we show in a coupl of altern simul in the  book  a steeper declin in hous price and construct activ could result in a path for the fed fund rate that   not differ materi from the one that appear to be current built into market expect   we remain comfort with our baselin project for hous  but it is still easier to see sizabl downsid risk than sizabl upsid risk to this aspect of our forecast  and that suggest to me that our modal forecast of gdp still has more weight to the downsid than the upsid   that said  given the strength over the intermeet period of the incom data outsid hous  that downward skew is probabl less pronounc in this forecast than in the one we present in septemb   turn to the price project  the question i pose at the outset was whi our forecast of core price inflat is larg unchang given higher oil price  a lower dollar and tighter resourc util   with respect to resourc util  both the gdp gap and the unemploy rate suggest onli slight tighter product and labor market than in our previous forecast  and given the flat of our aggreg suppli curv  the effect on price over this period is neglig   as for the lower dollar  we see higher import price inflat in the near term in line with the recent depreci  but these effect quick play through   more broad  the avail evid continu to suggest that exchang rate pass through to import price is quit low  which in turn mute the effect on broader price   the indirect consequ of higher oil price are a bit more consequenti  and all els be equal  would have ad about a tenth to our core price project in        but not all els was equal   the incom data on core pce price were again slight more favor than we had expect   the surpris in this intermeet period was larg in nonmarket price   more broad  the deceler that we have observ in core pce price over the past year has been greater than can be explain by our model  and we have carri a bit larger negat residu forward in this forecast   as a consequ  we expect core pce price inflat to move sideway at a     percent pace in      and       unchang from our previous forecast   overal price inflat is project to move down from   percent this year to     percent in      and     percent in        the deceler in overal price reflect some declin  on net  in energi price over the next two year and a dropback in food price inflat to a rate closer to that of core consum price   on the whole  i   d character the risk around our inflat forecast as rough balanc   nathan will continu our present
although the foreign economi appear to have grown at a moder pace dure the third quarter as a whole  indic for septemb and octob suggest that the recent financi turmoil may yet leav an imprint on activ in some countri   perhap the most strike evid on this score has been the ecb   s survey of euro area bank lend   in the third quarter  this survey show the sharpest shift toward tighten in it five year histori  along with evid of more stringent credit standard for busi and hous loan   in addit  we have seen downward move in survey and measur of sen ent in the euro area  particular in germani  although these indic have general remain in expansionari territori   in the unit kingdom  the growth of mortgag lend continu on a downward path in septemb  and a recent bank of england survey suggest a tighten of corpor credit condit   all in all  we see this  admit fragmentari  evid as broad consist with our assumpt in the septemb  book that fallout from the financi turmoil is like to exert some drag on growth over the next sever quarter in the euro area  the unit kingdom  and canada   this assess  howev  is mark by signific upsid and downsid risk   as it is still too soon to gaug these effect with much confid   as in our previous forecast  we do not see the turmoil weigh direct on activ in japan or the emerg market economi   more general  the contour of our forecast remain similar to those in septemb  recent data have confirm our expect that averag econom growth abroad declin to about     percent in the third quarter  cool from the veri rapid rate in the first half of the year   we see growth edg down further in the current quarter  to just over   percent  and remain at about that pace in      and        after the  book went to bed  we receiv chines gdp data  which accord to our season adjust quarter es  grew at an annual rate of just over   percent in the third quarter   a littl slower than we had expect and down from the    percent rate in the first half of the year   this deceler appear to have been led by a slow in invest and a smaller contribut from the extern sector   go forward  econom growth in china should remain below it previous doubl digit pace  as the chines author take further action to cool the countri   s boom real estat market and the rapid growth of bank lend   in addit to uncertainti about the eventu effect of the financi turmoil on real activ  other risk to our general favor foreign outlook are worth note  first on this list is the possibl of a softer than expect perform from the u s  economi   although there is talk in some quarter about so call decoupl   that is  that the foreign economi may now be less link to develop in the unit state than has been the case in the past   the juri is still out on this point   although domest demand   appear to have firm in some foreign countri in recent year  a mark slow in u s  growth would affect the rest of the world through trade channel  particular canada  mexico  and emerg asia  and  as highlight by the recent turmoil  probabl through financi channel as well   as a second risk  hous price valuat in mani advanc economi appear elev   given that  a correct in hous market abroad   with potenti sizabl accompani wealth effect   strike us as an import downsid risk for some countri   third  although we see averag foreign inflat remain well behav  at near     percent over the next two year  inflat risk cannot be dismiss   after sever year of except strong econom growth  the foreign economi on averag are now oper near potenti  and resourc constraint may be more bind than we current envis   in addit  food price have move up in mani countri  and the price of oil and other commod are at high level   inde  recent develop in oil market seem to pose intensifi risk   the spot price of wti is trade today at near     a barrel  up    sinc the  book went to bed   sinc your last meet  the spot wti price has climb     per barrel  while the far futur price has increas about     per barrel   it suffic to say that under suppli demand condit in the oil market are except tight   over the past sever year  as the global economi has expand brisk  oil product has increas onli sluggish   reflect both opec suppli restraint and diminish product from oecd countri   against this backdrop  the price of oil has been driven up further in recent week by report of decreas inventori  at a  e of year when such stock are typic on the rise  and by intensifi concern about the stabil of middl east oil product  trigger by tension between turkey and iraq and by concern about u s  relat with iran   we see opec   s plan to expand product         barrel per day begin on novemb    even if fulli implement  as unlik to go veri far in defus the tight in the market  futur market call for wti price to remain elev  in the neighborhood of     per barrel  through        i conclud with some upbeat news on u s  extern perform   export continu to surpris on the upsid  have shown except strength in the juli and august trade data  as export of aircraft  auto  and agricultur product have all expand brisk   consequ  as dave mention  real export of good and servic are now thought to have surg at a pace of    percent in the third quarter  up     percentag point from the last forecast   we es  that real import in the third quarter grew at a compar modest rate   taken togeth  these data suggest that net export made an arithmet contribut of    percentag point to u s  real gdp growth in the third quarter   go forward  we see export growth moder to just under   percent in the current quarter and proceed at a solid     percent averag rate through the next two year   relat to our septemb forecast  the path of export growth is up near   percentag point in the fourth quarter and by lesser   but still sizabl   amount in      and        this higher project reflect s ulus from recent declin in the dollar  which have exceed our previous project   the broad dollar index has drop more than   percent sinc your last meet   but in addit to support from the weaker dollar  we now see greater under strength in export than we had previous thought   our project path for import  in contrast  is littl chang from the last  book   import growth is slate to bounc up in the current quarter  larg becaus of a season rebound in oil import   thereaft  the project strengthen of u s  growth and a deceler in core import price should provid increas support to import   all told  we see the extern sector make a neutral contribut to u s  real gdp growth in the fourth quarter  contribut     percentag point to econom growth next year  and return to neutral in      as import acceler   thus  to the extent that our forecast materi  larg negat contribut from net export might veri well be a thing of the past     will now continu our present
i will be refer to the packag label    materi for fomc brief on octob project      the tabl show the central tendenc and rang of your current forecast for      and the next three year   where avail  the central tendenc and rang of the project last publish by the committe  •those submit for inclus in the juli monetari polici report  •are shown in ital      materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     notabl  a major of you condit your current project on an eas of monetari polici  with most of that major appar see lower rate as appropri either immin or within the next six month or so   even with that assum eas  your gdp growth forecast for      have been mark down slight sinc last june  and your outlook for next year has been revis down more substanti   mani of you note that last summer   s nipa revis led you to lower your es  of potenti gdp growth   most of you cite the intensif of the downturn in hous market  the turmoil in financi market  and higher oil price as factor lead you to scale back your expect for actual growth in      and       though some particip comment that rise net export could provid support to aggreg demand   the central tendenc of the econom growth forecast for      is now     percent to     percent  below the central tendenc of     percent to    percent in june   perhap part becaus you expect eas wherea the staff assum an unchang stanc of polici  the central tendenc of your econom growth project is abov the  book forecast of     percent for real econom growth in        that differ may also reflect your somewhat more op ist view of potenti growth   it is worth note that the diverg among your view concern the outlook for next year has widen substanti   the width of the central tendenc  for exampl  at near   percentag point  is about three  e that in the june project   the downward revis to the outlook for gdp growth was mirror in a small upward revis to the unemploy rate   the central tendenc of the project for unemploy at the end of this year is around    percent  and it center on a rate just under   percent at the end of next year   base on the comment that some of you have made about sustain rate of unemploy and on your longer run unemploy project  mani of you appar predict the emerg of a small amount of slack by the end of next year   with incom data on core inflat a bit better than you had expect and with some slack like next year  the central tendenc of your project for core pce inflat is down notic for      and is a shade lower for       most of you now see core inflat below   percent in both year   your near term forecast for total pce inflat are higher than those for core inflat  reflect surg energi price and  in some case  an expect of continu brisk increas in food price   with regard to the uncertainti in the outlook  most of you see the risk to growth as tilt to the downsid   even with an assum eas of polici   and judg that the degre of uncertainti regard prospect for econom activ is unusu high relat to averag level over the past twenti year   your commentari highlight downsid risk aris from the possibl that financi market turmoil and tighter credit condit could exert unexpect larg restraint on household and busi spend and that the downturn in hous could prove even steeper than current anticip   a slight major perceiv the risk to total inflat as broad balanc  and a more sizabl major judg that the risk to core inflat are in balanc  in both case  those in the minor saw the risk to inflat as tilt to the upsid   as the experi in the septemb trial run highlight  the committe   s polici statement will need to be review care for potenti inconsist with the risk assess submit with the project   i will return to that issu tomorrow   turn to the longer horizon forecast  you expect real gdp growth of around     percent and unemploy slight abov    percent in both      and       judg from your forecast narrat  these project are close to your es  of the economi   s potenti growth rate and the level of the nairu   the former is a bit higher than the staff es  of about     percent potenti growth  and the latter is close to the staff es    for      and       all of your core inflat forecast are in a rang of     to   percent   a coupl of you expect rise price of food and energi to keep total inflat abov   percent in       but all of your forecast for total inflat are within a rang of     to   percent in        mani of you state that you view your project for inflat in      as consist with price stabil
thank you   are there question for our colleagu   vice chairman
dave  this is about the  book forecast   i was go to say existenti  but i am not sure that is quit right    laughter   dave  is the  book forecast someth we should view as a modal forecast  as i think you impli  or the expect valu of the rang of plausibl scenario that might have
well  i would say this is a modal forecast  and as i indic  i think there is probabl more downsid mass than upsid mass in that probabl distribut at this point
is the monetari polici path that you reveal in the  book base on the modal forecast
think about our forecast as a modal forecast is correct
thank you   if i could ask one more question   in the  book  you reveal the usual assumpt for what you anticip for total credit growth  and you show it deceler signific over this period   how   the deceler you are anticip look compar with a rang of previous period in which the u s  economi was slow signific or period follow substanti financi distress   for exampl  if you compar it with         or          is it a modest deceler in credit growth  or   it look larg compar with that
well  i should get the fact befor i answer your question in term of exact how this compar with both the      period and the      period   we could certain do that and circul it to the committe   obvious  in our forecast we have credit growth deceler not just becaus overal activ is deceler but becaus we think there will be some import restraint on credit avail go forward   most of that  of cours  is on the mortgag side  but some of it is on the busi credit side as well   that said  we are not forecast a deep credit crunch   if you were more concern that that was what you were face  i don   t think this forecast is consist with it   this forecast is consist with some unusu restraint on the avail of credit  princip on the mortgag side but more broad elsewher  but not truli a deep or strong headwind type of episod in which there is substanti impair go forward   as i note at the last meet  even the restraint that we do have on the credit side fade over the come year
thank you   i have two brief question   one  in busi invest  particular equip and softwar  you have somewhat of a rebound in the earli half of        and then it fall off again in the latter half of         i didn   t quit understand   given the way you have the recoveri in hous come in the middl of       and presum some of the credit tighten cycl gradual diminish  whi is busi invest fall off again in the latter half of         the second question  just to get them both out on the tabl  is that you are predict that a    basi point unexpect boost to the fed fund rate would result in a fall in equiti of about   percent   now  the paper i have read random about that suggest that such an es  is probabl a bit on the high side   i just wonder where that number came from
we took that es  from a paper by ben bernank and ken kuttner   laughter
i thought that was     percent for     basi point  right  which would be a declin of a littl over   percent  not
of cours  we have multipl es     laughter
sorri   i just read the wrong one
we felt that in the past we did not typic worri about that sort of surpris effect  given that overal our abil to predict asset price is so limit to begin with   this seem stark enough that we thought we should probabl lean in that direct   whether we are too larg or too small i don   t know   it   s not a veri signific or consequenti effect   obvious  we are not pretend to forecast all the thing that might happen if you were not to eas at this meet in term of how the financi market might take that   we   re just tri to take the biggest piec  and that   s where we were
and the invest piec
it look to me as though some of the invest piec has to do with the idiosyncrasi of our forecast of the high tech area   the under core piec of e s spend follow pretti much a standard acceler path  where thing slow down more even through next year and then begin to pick up with the overal pickup in activ toward the end of next year as we move into        so i think your basic intuit about what you should have seen is there   we have some slowdown in high tech spend that sort of progress   in transport  in particular  thing are especi weak in the first half of this year   they pick up a littl in the begin of next year and then slow down again  and that realli is more base upon our forecast of motor vehicl and our forecast for aircraft product
i have two question   i guess the first is more a comment than a question  when we look at the net export   and i think you comment on that in term of the outlook   it seem to me that most of it is realli come on the import side  which i assum is import relat to domest demand and consumpt   look at the annual data   i   m look at page    in part   of the  book  which has the annual data over a string of year   export growth is actual slow in term of percentag growth year over year   so i guess the way that i would put it is  to what extent is the lower growth in import realli driven by lower aggreg consumpt rather than a genuin improv in the current account   that   s one question  anoth question is realli quit separ  and i think it will tie into our later go round here   i don   t have a good sens of the relat import of your anecdot inform in modifi your outlook compar with the under data that you follow so thorough and so expert   to what extent do you modifi the view base on the data  the model  and your read of the number by your anecdot inform  your busi contact
so do you want me to start with that  mr sheet   sure   that sound good    laughter
on the anecdot side  as i think about the revis that we   ve made to the forecast of this most recent period  by which we have taken down the level of gdp near   percentag point for our es  of the effect of the financi disturb  i don   t know whether you   d call that base on anecdot or on actual data   it felt pretti much like guesswork with a few anecdot at the  e of the last meet  when we had some measur of financi stress that were signific and we knew on the data side  in term of the impair to the mortgag market  that someth veri signific was go on   the hous side was about half the adjust that we made   so i guess i   d just say that a big chunk of that was probabl data base  but some guesswork was involv in how much restraint on hous activ would come from the cutback in mortgag avail that were go to occur in the subprim market  in term of the consum side last  e  we realli had veri littl to go on  except a hint that mayb consum sen ent had weaken somewhat   sinc then i think we have accumul a littl more evid in favor of our hypothesi that possibl some restraint on spend will occur go forward   consum sen ent has remain low relat to what we think the other macro fundament would suggest   we think that there is a correl between the residu of explain consum sen ent and our consumpt equat   so that correl  in addit to the senior loan offic survey   again  i don   t know whether you consid that anecdot evid or systemat data  but there   s a veri substanti and widespread uptick in the tighten of term and standard for both busi and household loan   give us more confid that what we thought were pretti sizabl effect that we built into the forecast have some credibl basi  now  there are still some touchi feeli kind of thing that we   re look at   for exampl  with the assist of the reserv bank  we did the survey of our beig book contact on capit spend   i can   t say that we didn   t make some adjust to our e s forecast on the basi of those anecdot  but again  those anecdot gave us a littl more confid that someth may be happen on the capit spend side go forward   so i wish i could tell you that  yes  three tenth of this is anecdot and seven tenth is data   there   s a big gray area between the kind of inform that we gather versus the gdp data   if you ask how the gdp data alon influenc our outlook  as i note in my brief  those have been pretti clear to the upsid  and we haven   t yet seen ani hard evid in the actual spend data outsid the hous sector that we   re get ani restraint   so that remain a forecast base upon these other shred of evid that we think support some notion that there will be a weaken go forward
in respons to your first question  i think the answer is that it   s the improv in the net export contribut in the current account that   s be driven by both a strengthen of export and a soften of import   the net export contribut or the direct contribut of export to gdp growth has risen rough    basi point over the past coupl of year   so about   percentag point   by the same token  the arithmet negat drag from import has been reduc about    basi point   i think it   s strict an arithmet comput thing   your observ that it   s more import than export is absolut right  compar      with where we were sever year ago   but certain for the third quarter and for the second half  export have been extraordinarili strong  and import have been softer than mayb they were a coupl of year ago but not extraordinarili weak   so in the near term  it   s more an export stori   then the other point is that certain you   re also correct that the soften of import that we   ve seen over the past few year has been driven in larg measur by the soften of u s  domest demand  and that   s probabl   i don   t have an exact decomposit here   on the order of two third of the soften in import
other question   if not  we   re readi for our econom go round   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i will talk a littl about the district this  e  it continu to perform well  with ongo weak in the hous sector offset by strength in agricultur and energi   as has been true for a while  construct activ remain mix  with weak in residenti construct offset by continu strength in commerci construct   in term of residenti construct  both the number of singl famili permit and the valu of residenti construct contract declin in septemb  and home inventori rose with slower home sale  as is happen elsewher   howev  district home price measur by the ofheo index edg up in the second quarter and remain stronger than in the nation as a whole   on the commerci side  after a robust spring  construct activ has slow but has remain solid  energi region  such as wyom  report strong activ   but even in the non energi region  activ remain solid   offic vacanc rate were stabl  and absorpt rate declin   in addit  develop report more stringent credit standard  and they expect credit avail to remain tight  consum spend soften in septemb   mall traffic was flat  and retail report that sale were down slight   in addit  auto dealer report that sale fell further in septemb as high gasolin price cut demand for our suv sale and for van   in other area  though  activ appear to remain at least moder   for exampl  travel and tourism remain healthi   in addit  manufactur activ pick up slight in octob   solid increas among produc of durabl good offset a weaken among produc of food  chemic  and other nondur good   even so  purchas manag remain op ist about futur activ  as most forward look index strengthen or held steadi   final  we continu to see strength in agricultur and energi   district produc are sell a bumper crop at high price as poor crop condit in the rest of the world trim global inventori and boost export demand   in addit  robust meat demand kept cattl and hog price abov breakeven level  the sharp rise in farm incom led to a surg in farm capit spend in the third quarter and is expect to rise further in the fourth quarter  turn to the nation economi  my outlook for growth is basic unchang from our last meet   general speak  econom indic have been a bit stronger over the intermeet period  as describ here  but financi market continu  obvious  to exhibit some stress   the senior loan offic survey suggest moder tighten of credit condit   that is consist with our es  of slower growth in the current quarter   as befor  though  i remain more op ist than the  book about both the near term outlook and the longer run growth potenti for the economi   specif  i think growth over the forecast period will averag about     percent   my forecast is base on maintain the fed fund rate at it current level of    percent through the middl of next year befor reduc it to it more neutral level late next year or earli        with regard to trend growth  i continu to expect a declin in potenti growth from about    percent to     percent by       disappoint hous data have led me to mark down my near term forecast for residenti invest   i continu to expect that residenti invest will declin through the first part of next year befor turn up in the second half   also  after strong growth in the first half of this year  nonresidenti construct is like  perhap  to slow signific over the next year and a half   support growth in the near term will be moder growth in consum and govern spend along with strength in export driven by the lower dollar and robust foreign growth  turn to the risk to the outlook  i believ they remain on the downsid as far as real output but have not worsen notic sinc our last meet  especi with that action   i believ that construct  both residenti and nonresidenti  and slower consum spend from higher energi price constitut the main risk to the outlook   with regard to the inflat outlook  recent data on core inflat continu to be  as note here  favor   i expect core pce inflat to averag about     percent over the forecast period   rememb  assum no chang in the fed fund rate   but i also expect that overal pce inflat next year will moder as the effect of higher food and energi price wear off   howev  i do remain concern about the upsid risk to inflat as well   greater dollar depreci and higher energi and commod price  along with greater pass through from all three  could push inflat higher for a period of  e   in addit  i am also concern about the implic of the gradual upcreep in the tip measur of expect inflat for the long run path  and i am receiv more anecdot inform  in discuss with individu in our region  about a chang in expect about inflat as they continu to deal with some rise price in materi and other good   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in the district econom condit sinc our septemb meet   except for hous  activ is expand at a modest pace  somewhat below trend   our busi contact are cautious  general expect slow growth to continu over the next quarter  but they remain fair op ist for busi condit six to twelv month out   payrol employ continu to expand at a slow pace in our three state  which partial reflect slow popul growth  and so the unemploy rate remain slight below that of the nation   retail sale have general held up  but there are diverg view among retail regard holiday sale   high end store expect a veri strong finish to the year  lower end merchant are more cautious   hous construct and sale continu to declin  but the pace of that declin is in line with the expect at our last meet   the valu of nonresidenti build contract has declin more sharpli in our region than in the nation as a whole   nevertheless  i would character nonresidenti real estat market as firm   that offic vacanc rate are declin and commerci rent are rise suggest a posit outlook for commerci construct go forward  accord to our busi outlook survey  manufactur activ in the district has been increas at a modest pace for the past sever month   the general index of econom activ move down slight  from      in septemb to       shipment and new order also weaken slight   staff analysi suggest that our manufactur index  which preced the releas of nation industri product number  provid use inform in forecast month manufactur ip and total ip   that forecast model is predict a rise in both manufactur ip and total ip in octob   about two third of the district manufactur and servic sector firm we have poll said that recent chang in financi condit have not prompt ani chang in their capit spend plan  and the other firm are about even split as expect a slight decreas or a slight increas over the next six to twelv month compar with the past six to twelv month   howev  in speak with my busi contact  i do hear a sens of continu caution among busi in their capit spend plan   the manufactur seem to be a bit stronger than the servic firm  perhap reflect a more robust export market  which mani of them are particip in   district banker  in general  continu to express concern over hous and mortgag lend but see commerci and industri lend as fair stabl and proceed about as they had expect  there has been littl chang in the district   s inflat pictur sinc our last meet  firm continu to report higher benefit cost  but other wage pressur have moder   our manufactur report have to pay higher price for mani input  particular energi relat input and petroleum base product as well as agricultur commod   they have pass on mani of those increas in term of higher price to their consum   while retail report onli modest price increas for mani product  food price are general higher  in summari  sinc our last meet  there has been littl chang in the econom condit in the district or in the outlook for the region   overal  busi activ in the region is advanc at a fair modest pace  and most of our contact expect that pace to continu for the next quarter or so   but in general  firm in the district remain op ist about busi six to twelv month from now  turn to the nation  the economi appear less vulner to me than it did at the  e of our last meet   financi market have improv somewhat  as bill   was tell us  condit are not back to normal yet in all segment of the market  but the market that are still under stress are the same one that were under stress last month   subprim and jumbo mortgag and asset back commerci paper are the one that still are struggl   price discoveri still plagu mani of these market  and i suspect it will take some  e befor the market can sort thing out and trade return to normal   that   not mean that the ul  agre upon market price for some of these asset will bear ani resembl to what they look like befor august   inde  they probabl won   t  but that   s not necessarili a bad sign or a caus for concern  it may even be a healthi develop   we haven   t seen disrupt spread to other asset class for the most part  and the level of stress in financi market seem to have fallen even as volatil remain high   the spread of jumbo over convent mortgag rate remain elev  reflect some concern  i think  about the risk that expens home may face greater price declin than other home  but the premium is less than it was in septemb  both invest grade and non invest grade corpor bond issu have increas  financi institut have begun to write off some of their invest and take the loss   this has weigh heavili on equiti market  but i view the write down as a necessari part of the process toward stabil in the market   earn report from nonfinanci firm have actual been pretti favor   i   m not say that we are out of the wood yet  but in my view the risk for a serious meltdown in financi market have lessen somewhat sinc our last meet  the news on general econom activ has improv somewhat sinc our last meet as well   inde  some of the data have come in better than expect   employ was revis up  and retail sale data suggest that consum spend remain resili  despit the downturn in hous   like the  book  my outlook for the economi has chang littl sinc our last meet  when we act preemptiv and lower rate to    forestal some of the potenti advers effect of financi market disrupt and the expect intensif of the hous correct on the broader economi      hous invest and sale continu to declin but about as expect in our forecast   after all  the rapid reduct in subprim lend is exacerb the declin in hous demand and thus home sale  contribut to the slower recoveri of that sector   other sector of the economi have perform about as i expect  with littl evid as yet of ani major spillov from hous   oil price have move higher than expect sinc our last meet  as has been discuss  but it is unclear to me yet how perman that increas will be or how much of a drag it might be on activ   the oil price rise is like to show through to headlin inflat in the come month   although core inflat measur have improv sinc the begin of the year  the rise in energi price has the potenti to put upward pressur on core inflat   thus  while inflat and inflationari expect have been stabl to date  i suspect that inflat risk are now more to the upsid than they were in septemb  the forecast is an import context for our polici  in my view   we have stress in the past year that we are data driven and respond to the evolut of our forecast   in general  like the  book  as i said  my forecast of the economi go forward is littl chang from my septemb view   i see that growth return to trend  which i es  to be about       a littl higher than the  book   late in      as the hous correct run it cours and the financi market turbul unwind   core pce inflat remain slight below   percent next year and moder toward my goal of     percent by        i built in a    basi point eas some  in earli      to bring the fund rate back down to a more neutral level  and in my baselin forecast i assum a constant fund rate thereaft   that forecast  howev  is conting on inflat and inflationari expect remain well behav   have said that  i repeat my caution that inflationari pressur are somewhat elev at this point  and we run the risk that inflationari expect may becom unhing if the market suspect that we have lessen our commit to keep inflat contain   thus  i don   t rule out the possibl that we may have to revers cours and tighten polici some  in      or      in order to achiev consist between my target rate of inflat of     and inflationari expect   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the boston forecast is veri close to that of the  book   with the constant feder fund rate assumpt  the economi is veri close to full employ  and core inflat is close to   percent at the end of        such an outcom is consist with what i would hope to achiev with appropri monetari polici  howev  while this is an expect path that seem quit reason  the distribut of risk around that outcom for growth remain skew to the downsid   our forecast  like that of the  book  expect particular weak residenti invest   problem in financ mortgag  expect of fall hous price  and more sever financi stress for homebuild are like to weigh heavili over the next two quarter   in fact  our forecast for residenti invest has becom suffici bleak that there may actual be some upsid risk to it    laughter  somewhat surpris to me has been the lack of spillov to the rest of the economi from the problem in residenti invest   i remain concern that fall hous price will further sap consum confid and caus a pullback in consumpt  though to date there is littl evid of a signific effect of the hous problem on consum spend   similar  i would have expect the financ problem that have aggrav the hous situat to have caus a sharper reduct in invest in general and in nonresidenti structur in particular  howev  so far these remain risk rather than outcom   thus  while i am worri about the downsid risk  i am remind that forecast have frequent overes  the consequ of liquid problem in the past  on the financi side  there have definit been improv in market condit  though market remain fragil   particular worrisom has been the announc of signific downgrad of tranch of cdos and mortgag back secur with larg exposur to the subprim mortgag market   not onli have the lower tranch experienc signific downgrad  but a number of the aaa and aa tranch have been downgrad to below invest grade   some investor cannot retain below invest grade secur and are forc to sell these secur in an alreadi depress market   the number of the downgrad  the magnitud of the downgrad  and the piecem rate announc all are like to call into further question the reliabl of the rate process   if mani high grade secur tie to mortgag are downgrad to below invest grade  some investor may conclud that repric of even high grade tranch   not reflect a liquid problem but rather a substanti reevalu of credit risk   thus  i am concern that continu widespread downgrad may make recoveri in the securit market more difficult  particular for nonconform mortgag  with a consequ increas in the financ cost of these asset   i also remain concern that the asset back commerci paper market remain fragil   while investor seem to be distinguish between conduit whose structur or under asset are quit riski  my sens is that money manag are watch the market quit close   i continu to hear concern over the possibl that some money market fund will experi loss that will not be support by their parent  result in increas investor concern with the safeti of money market fund more general  on balanc  the data both on the real economi and on financi market have improv sinc our septemb meet   that improv make it more like that the economi will continu to recov gradual from the financi turmoil   howev  both the real and the financi risk remain skew to the downsid
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   like the global economi  the eleventh district is slow  but relat to the other district it remain veri strong   our retail sale improv in septemb   nonresidenti and commerci construct remain elev   servic sector job growth strengthen signific in septemb  and our staff es  that      percent of the job creat in the countri year to date were creat in the state of texa   i just want to mention that    laughter   needless to say  wage are rise becaus of labor shortag  a declin in immigr  and the increas in minimum wage   i will stop with the texa brag and now go on to the nation economi  i think presid   just gave an excel summari of the financi market   i would add onli the follow   that with regard to credit market  the harden of the arteri or the blockag of the aorta or whatev cardiovascular analog we want to choos to describ what happen is no longer as sever and life threaten as it appear to be in august   as mention by the staff  whether it is net bond issuanc of invest grade secur or c i loan et cetera  the market are move toward price asset accord to what they will sell for rather than what their hypothet mathemat model valu might posit   there was a startl statement in the financi  e on friday morn   somebodi  otherwis forgett  said     corpor treasur are no longer buy thing they don   t understand       laughter  imagin that   investor are come home from lala land   to be sure  we   re not out of the wood quit yet  as presid   and presid   mention   the situat remain real  but we   ve gone beyond suspend realiti   if you will forgiv me  you might say we have gone from the ridicul to the subprim
let the transcript say    groan       laughter
by that i mean  by the way  that the subprim market is a focus of angst  which it should be  but the ridicul practic of the suspens of reason in valu all asset class  if not over  is in remiss   we have a long way to go befor full recoveri and must acknowledg that shock regard access might occur   i am confid  as i have said in previous meet  that   just to be polit   some cow patti might show up in the punchbowl of some portfolio  perhap especi in europ and asia   but i would submit  mr  chairman  that we are on our way back to market price by reason rather than by fantasi   so  while we must remain readi to act as need  i think it is appropri to focus our discuss today and tomorrow foursquar on the economi  and i want to turn to that now  the wealth effect of the sever markdown in hous is as yet incalcul and worrisom   as the  book state and my sound with ceo confirm  there are as yet no appreci  let alon debilit  sign of spillov into the rest of the economi   the economi has been weaken   you see it in the rail and truck and retail   it has not shown sign of succumb as much as one might have expect to the full blown virus that is afflict hous   as dave mention  go back to juli  bank in our district and everywher els have report tighten term and standard on loan to busi and household   the overal sen ent or mood of the countri  as report by the press and the survey  is sour   yet we haven   t seen sharp increas in initi claim  low pmi  purchas manag index  read  or sharpli fall durabl good order   household are still reason op ist about their job prospect   consum spend continu to grow  albeit at a slower pace   the ceo of disney start his discuss with me this  e by say     i hate to be the bearer of good news     and went on to cite an intern survey they recent complet that show that famili plan to spend liber on vacat  despit setback in presum hous price  as well as strong ad statist for their broadcast network  there remain widespread report of labor shortag  not just in our district but also elsewher   the bottom line  mr  chairman  is that  there is clear a fat left tail on growth   the economi is grow slower   but the economi is grow at a posit pace   some might say that it has slow to a sustain pace   in part  this is due to infrastructur invest  spend on nondefens capit good that is better than expect  decent if not robust e s demand  fiscal s ulus  and strong export perform that we talk about earlier  assist by superior demand growth abroad  facilit by a progress weaker dollar   i note that we meet the day after the trade weight dollar celebr a post   bretton wood low   not an easi thing for a strong dollar man to note  certain  there is a risk that downward econom momentum will emerg   i worri about the plight of the big  popul state like florida and california under the crush of the hous implos   i take note of the report from up  the rail  and the trucker as to the deceler in year over year trend in pre holiday shipment   i realiz that wal mart same store growth has slow  that mall traffic is down  and so on   but not a singl one of my thirti five ceo interlocutor  except for the homebuild  felt that the economi was at risk of fall off the tabl   fluor and the other big builder   or logist organ  as i like to call them   report a boom domest infrastructur busi  especi in the petrochem sector   the technolog folk  as manifest by the earn report of microsoft  appl  and other  continu to find that demand is brisk   cisco   s ceo confirm that busi with all but the financi institut    has begun to flow again    after be laid low by the uncertainti of august   the airlin report volum condit as    less bad    than they were in the third quarter   up   s cfo  about to becom ceo  who serv on presid     s board  is concern  like the rail  about consum holiday demand  and note that tran pacif shipment into the unit state have slow   yet when he dig deep into the data  he will tell you that the tech side look good  so the net effect is that  while nowher near robust     domest  condit have not materi worsen     except for hous and bill   s two law firm  we are not hear of signific lag of receiv or collect   mani of my interlocutor  howev  worri about price  as do our staff member in dalla   we differ signific  mr  chairman  from the central assumpt of the  book in our view on headlin inflat look forward   i notic you cock an eye in my direct     when you were talk about the outlier   the  book has a   percent number for pce inflat for this year  follow by a deceler  to a pace of     percent in      and     in        we in dalla are not as confid that we will continu to experi a disinfl of the momentum of the pce   part this stem from concern express anecdot by big import like wal mart  who report stiffen chines price  by the ceo of jcpenney  who is plan for cost increas of good import from china on the order of   to   percent next year  and by the user of pulp and recycl wast paper that are set to announc a   percent increas in essenti paper product effect in februari  have just announc a doubl digit increas not too long ago  our concern at the dalla fed stem from two more pervas sourc than that anecdot evid i just cite  and those are food and energi  for which we anticip a more pernici pass through effect from recent rapid price increas of under commod   the concern we have for food is encapsul in the eye pop chart on page ii    of part   of the  book   you have to have a hawk   s eye to see this chart from that end of the tabl  but it show an incred diverg between food price and the core pce   now this pattern has a histor preced   a spread of this magnitud between food price and core index occur on sever occas between      and        in       the gap was    percent   in       the gap was close when the cpi rose up accord   but we have not seen a gap of this natur in over a quarter centuri   wholesal food price are up     percent for the year to date   through septemb  the cpi for food is up     percent   as mention by one of the previous interlocutor  milk and   groceri price are rise at doubl digit pace   this goe beyond ethanol  mr  chairman  as a driver of shift in crop rotat and product   it is occur against a ramp up of the calor intak of a few billion new eater in china  india  and elsewher   this is hard encourag  and it inject a modicum of doubt in predict a signific declin in pce inflat  we spoke about energi price dynam earlier   they further cloud the pictur   if you talk to exxon or independ  they will tell you that there is no problem in find oil  in refin it  or in deliv the final product   they will  howev  note that there are two key impuls at work   first  there is no evid slowdown in demand growth accord to them   that is  domest   and the appetit in the bric  brazil  russia  india  and china  and in the develop countri was describ as voraci   an enorm amount of infrastructur in chemic plant capac is be construct everywher  from the gulf coast of the unit state to the middl east to china and singapor  in order to be nearer to either feedstock or grow final demand   ani analysi of the incom elast of demand for oil in low but rise incom nation like china and india point to demand for oil that will grow even fa  than their slight slower but still rapid grow incom level   second  price pressur on crude at the margin are compound by noncommerci activ  which we did not talk about earlier  noncommerci contract  the busywork of what are call    citi refin    in the industri   that is  the citi of london and the financi exchang   have of late been run at tripl their tradit volum accord to exxon   s ceo  drive oil through       thus far  gasolin and distil  which is where the pass through rubber hit the consum price road  have been tame in respons   bill discuss the low crack spread  for exampl   yet our model at the dalla fed for retail gasolin price envis increas abov    a gallon next year if crude stay abov      which we consid a reason probabl   similar  price pressur for distil are increas probabl   final  while current high inventori continu  it is noteworthi that natur gas price have revers their summer slide downward to       per million btu and are now quot at    at the henri hub   all this give me  mr  chairman  a sens of discomfort  like that express by presid hoenig and presid    on the headlin inflat front and is a remind that the balanc of risk is not necessarili skew onli toward slower growth   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   yes  sir  vice chairman
are we permit to question
you describ vivid the bunch of forc work on headlin inflat   but sinc you identifi yourself as a negat outlier on the inflat forecast  it seem to me your headlin forecast is still for signific moder in headlin inflat in         am i wrong in that   at least i infer from this that you   re not show an acceler in core pce inflat
no   but i am talk about a spread be maintain between the two  and i am concern about it  depend on where we are go to go in term of our communic exercis  which we will talk about tomorrow   but we don   t show as much relief on pce inflat as the  book indic nor as the central tendenc indic  and i want to explain whi
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   over the past week or so  we have been follow the devast fire in southern california   they have burn over         acr  destroy near       home  and inflict seven death and sixti injuri   these were larg fire  even by california standard  but they were by no mean the largest in recent memori  and  of cours  the loss of life and econom cost pale compar with katrina   while the fire have serious affect the live of mani individu  they do not seem like to show up in the macroeconom data  turn to the nation economi  develop sinc we met six year   six week ago   actual  it seem like just two week ago    laughter  general have been favor and the risk to the outlook for growth have eas somewhat   but i think it is too earli to say that we are out of the wood   the inflat news has continu to be favor  but some upsid risk have becom more promin   with respect to econom activ  we have rais our forecast for growth in both the third and the fourth quarter in respons to incom data  even though the pace of deterior in the hous sector has been more sever than we expect and the problem associ with hous financ seem far from resolut   we agre with  book that residenti invest is like to continu it sever contract for at least a few more quarter   we also agre with  book that the rest of the economi has held up reason well  at least so far   export have been strong  and while busi fix invest seem to be slow  it should still make a robust contribut to growth in the second half of this year  with respect to consum spend  most aggreg data suggest onli a modest deceler so far   such read help to allay our concern about potenti spillov from hous to consumpt  but they don   t complet assuag them   survey measur of consum confid are down sharpli sinc the financi turmoil began  and most index of hous price show outright declin   given the current state of the hous and mortgag market  bigger declin go forward are a distinct possibl   inde  the case shiller futur data for hous price point to larger declin in the month ahead   a sharp drop in hous price would like crimp consum spend over  e through wealth and collater effect   some of my director and other contact are also rais warn flag about consum demand   for exampl  the ceo of a larg well known high end retail said that the compani   s sale are soften and that the compani is have to work dilig to control inventori   in his view  the consum has pull back   the ceo of a southern california bank observ a number of his client talk about a drop in discretionari consum purchas   the bottom line is that consumpt spend seem to be all right for the  e be  but there is a real risk that household may cut back on spend more than expect in respons to higher oil price  a slower economi  and econom uncertainti  i agre with presid     s assess of financi market   strain appear to have eas a bit on balanc sinc our septemb meet  with interbank lend market show some improv and spread on asset back commerci paper declin   but structur credit relat to mortgag remain quit troublesom  and liquid condit and treasuri bill market are still at  e strain   my impress is that  despit have move in a posit direct over the past six week  these market remain vulner to shock  and so the economi remain at risk from further financi disrupt   both survey evid and anecdot evid have confirm that bank are tighten lend standard across the board  tighter term and condit are be appli to a rang of busi lend  includ commerci real estat  and on most household lend from prime and nonprim mortgag to auto and home equiti loan  the main financi variabl that are common includ in formal macroeconometr model appear to have chang sinc the onset of the financi shock   say  in late june   in way that should have rough offset effect   oil price are mark higher  which should restrain consum spend  and the stock market is rough unchang sinc june in spite of the financi turmoil   a weaker dollar should have a posit influenc on growth   mortgag rate on jumbo loan and the rate face the riskiest corpor borrow are higher  but mani privat borrow rate are down becaus of the declin in treasuri yield   of cours  the current level of treasuri yield  as well as the stock market and dollar  reflect at least in part the market   s expect that the committe will eas the stanc of monetari polici at this meet  under our forecast is the polici assumpt that the committe will cut the fund rate anoth    basi point at this meet   in assess the appropri path of the stanc of polici  i took a number of consider into account   first  core consum inflat current is at a level that i consid consist with price stabil   second  unemploy is veri near my best es  of the full employ rate   in the context of a taylor type rule  these consider impli that the real fund rate should be near it neutral level   in fact  ani version of the taylor rule you prefer  with whatev rate you want to put on inflat versus the gap  will give you the same recommend becaus all the term are zero and drop out  except for one   the equilibrium real rate   of cours  we cannot know the level of the real equilibrium rate with certainti   defin in term of the pce price index  our best es  is in the rang of   to     percent  which is well below the current real rate of about   percent  i would like to highlight two addit point here   first  the actual real rate has been boost over the past six month or so by declin in short term inflat expect  whether one measur them by lag inflat  by survey of expect inflat over the next year or so  or by forecast of inflat includ the  book forecast   second  one import aspect of the financi turmoil is that it probabl repres in part a movement toward a more reason price of risk  as seen in the rise in risk spread   this develop tend to push the equilibrium real fund rate down toward the lower portion of the rang i just cite  the bottom line is that in my view  even without the contractionari effect of recent financi develop  an appropri stanc of monetari polici would involv further declin in the fed fund rate   i have assum that the fund rate drop to     percent by the end of this year and to    by the end of next year   my assum path end in the same place and embodi the same medium term assumpt concern neutral as frb us  on which the extend  book forecast reli   the onli differ concern  e   we assum a more rapid path to the long run than the  book     our forecast show real gdp growth gradual pick up to around     percent  our es  of potenti  by the end of next year   howev  given that the financi shock is not yet resolv  i think the downsid risk to this forecast predomin  with regard to inflat  i expect core pce inflat to remain around    percent over the next sever year   the probabl appear of a small amount of labor market slack is like to help hold down inflat   in addit  i expect that  with inflat remain below   percent  inflat expect will edg down as well  reinforc our success   i hope that this result will be aid by the releas of our extend forecast and the greater awar of where we would like to see inflat settl down   i see the risk to my inflat forecast as moder and main to the upsid in view of recent increas in oil and food price  declin in the dollar  and a slower rate of structur product growth  so  in summari  i think the most like outcom is that the economi will move forward toward a soft land   i see downsid risk to econom activ and some upsid risk to inflat   but in view of continu question about the effect of the financi market shock  i am more concern about the activ side of thing right now
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   like mani other around the tabl  my report to this committe in septemb indic a sharp deterior in busi confid   my busi contact were concern about what may happen   dure the intermeet period i heard less about what may happen and more about what is actual happen   my contact who are link to residenti real estat have seen a further and  in some case  sharp drop off in busi activ   my bank supervis and regul staff told me just a few day ago that they   re now see a sudden and sizabl percentag increas in nonperform loan at a number of larg bank compani in my district   to be sure  nonperform loan had been at extrem low level  and most of the sharp rise can be trace to mortgag and construct develop lend   but i   m now begin to hear report that banker are experienc some loan perform problem outsid their real estat portfolio   the ceo of a larg  major bank in my district has also report difficulti in securit the student loan that they   re make  forc them to keep those loan on their book and to make adjust elsewher in their balanc sheet   to what extent these bank condit are affect overal bank lend is not obvious  but clear there has been some disrupt to the channel of intermedi  and i am now begin to hear report of some spillov to other sector of the economi   a grow number of retail tell me that they have seen a notic declin in spend sinc mid septemb in item rang from auto to apparel  while my report from the busi communiti reflect a falloff in busi condit from what we submit to the beig book just a few week ago  they don   t necessarili indic a signific deviat from the slowdown that was alreadi built into the econom project that i submit in septemb   in prepar for this meet  i found it difficult to judg whether the report of weak that i am hear repres an unfold of the septemb project or addit deterior in the outlook   in the end  i have onli minor differ with the  book project in the near term and  like the  book  made onli minor revis to my forecast   i see econom activ a bit softer than the  book for the remaind of       but i project slight better growth in        like the  book  i have assum an unchang path for the fed fund rate over the forecast period   the recent rise in oil price has caus me to push up my near term pce project  but inflat expect project remain anchor around   percent   i see a small upsid risk to the near term inflat project as a result of the continu dollar depreci  but on the whole  i continu to judg our inflat risk as reason balanc  i would like to conclud by echo the sen ent of other around the tabl   consider strain in the financi sector remain  and further turmoil in market is a distinct possibl   i think that  in this environ  household and busi can easili be spook   excus the halloween pun   and i don   t think it would take much addit tight in credit market to push my fragil near term growth outlook even lower   so this concern continu to be the predomin risk to my outlook   thank you  mr  chairman

condit on the philadelphia index  we actual have margin predict valu for the nation ism   but i continu   a modest hous spillov into busi invest plan seem to be unfold as well   in the recent board commiss survey of capit invest plan  our district was among those in which more busi plan to trim rather than boost spend in the month ahead   again  a more detail look reveal that most firm plan reduct have tie to hous   report on retail sale in the district remain soft  with sale of automobil and build materi notabl weak   in addit  an execut from a major transport firm headquart in the district told us that freight volum  both rail and truck  are now at the lowest level sinc the      recess   although in a number of district market commerci real estat activ remain healthi  we are hear scatter report of commerci construct project be shelv   one director from d c  said that commerci develop there     sn   t have the puls it had six week ago      the turmoil in financi market has not appreci constrain busi lend in our district  howev   contact general describ credit as readili avail to creditworthi borrow  but some say spread have widen a bit   on the price front  our month measur suggest some moder in growth despit ongo complaint of higher input cost  at our last meet  i was more op ist than the  book on the nation economi   a signific part of the differ was relat to hous  where i saw greater probabl of the drag reced sooner   longer term  i had a somewhat higher es  of trend product growth  which support a somewhat stronger outlook for household consumpt   the main shift in my perspect sinc the last meet is that i am now at least as pessimist as the  book about prospect for hous bottom out any  soon   the    percent fall in hous start in septemb was certain eye catch  and it indic that the weak summer hous market tail off further toward the end   in our district  and this seem to be true elsewher as well  the hous downturn appear to have spread into mani former unaffect market   it is hard for me to believ that ani discern stabil is like befor the spring  when the season pickup in hous activ typic take place   even then a prolong period of depress activ seem more like than ani notic bounceback   other recent news suggest a bit more demand side fallout from the hous market than i had been expect   manufactur product was sluggish in august and septemb  and durabl good order have shown onli modest growth  especi outsid the aircraft industri   i mention a minut ago that our survey of the fifth district manufactur sector   which  by the way  is larger than the philadelphia and new york manufactur sector    laughter  is show a signific slowdown for octob  particular in hous relat industri  consum spend has been a sourc of stabil dure this hous correct  and i expect that to remain true over the forecast period   i think household spend will general expand in line with dispos incom  but even though consumpt advanc broad in the third quarter  it now seem we   re in for a bit of a slowdown this quarter   in that regard  i   m feel sympathi for what presid   said   so i   m less sanguin overal about the near term outlook for growth at this meet  although that may just repres catch up on my part to the  book   s past level of gloomi  have said all that  i do believ that the effect of this summer   s financi market adjust are like to be limit  and out beyond the middl of the next year  i   m  again  more op ist than the  book and for the usual reason   i think that product growth and  thus  real incom growth will be somewhat higher than in the  book forecast  and my outlook for the person save rate is center on it current valu rather than a steadi increas  inflat appear to have tick up a bit in septemb  at least accord to the cpi   still  year over year core pce inflat remain reason contain  and i   ve been struck by the extent to which tip inflat compens has held relat steadi in recent month  especi given our eas move last month and the run up in oil price   while i would like to see inflat come down further  i   m somewhat more comfort about inflat than i was at the begin of the year   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   as i have note in the past  the industri mix in the sixth district look a lot like the countri as a whole   the region data and anecdot inform show that  although the sixth district economi is still expand  the pace is margin weaker than it was in septemb   in earlier meet i comment on the sever of the hous situat in the district   there is no improv in sight for the hous market  and there are sign that the sharp declin in residenti construct is spill over into nonresidenti real estat segment  such as shop center develop   employ growth is soften as well  although the largest negat effect are in construct relat sector  the slowdown in job growth appear to be fair broad base  the broad contour of our nation forecast is similar to the  book baselin   like the  book  our forecast includ a slow in busi invest   base on our survey of district busi contact  it appear that the low level of expect capit expenditur are due main to pessim about the pace of econom activ rather than restrict credit condit per se  specif  financi market turbul   not appear to have direct affect econom activ  but it has creat a greater uncertainti about the outlook for the economi   as a consequ  the major of my director and busi contact are report veri littl in the way of plan to increas capit expenditur in the come year   where busi invest is discretionari  most respond report a wait and see postur  more posit  the weaker dollar   appear to be have a posit effect on export from the region   for the year to date  the dollar valu of export through the sixth district port was up    percent through august  wherea import growth was onli    percent   not coincident  the major of busi that indic they were increas capit expenditur over the come month were export  in the run up to this fomc meet  i again made call to a few financi market particip  and they reflect a rang of institut and market perspect   a synthesi of this opinion is consist with the view that were express earlier by bill   and other   there   s a widespread view that persist volatil in credit market is bound to negat affect the general economi   credit market condit have improv somewhat  but stabil may be a long way off   a second wave of volatil may accompani incom detail regard mortgag delinqu caus by rate reset in       and there   s a suspicion that third quarter writedown may be follow by substanti further loss recogn at year end   also  as referenc in the bluebook  there is skeptic about the m lec  ma  liquid enhanc conduit  propos from sever angl  in summari  our sound of the economi  inform by formal model work  point to a continu slow of the economi that will like persist well into next year   anecdot  credit constraint outsid the hous sector do not appear to be a major factor at this stage   but uncertainti creat by financi market turbul   seem to be act as a constraint  and i believ that the heighten uncertainti regard the econom outlook for      warrant consider of insur against this downsid risk  with respect to the outlook for inflat  i agre with the view express by other that recent develop in energi price  if they persist  make it like that we are about to enter anoth period in which headlin number substanti exceed the trend suggest by core measur   becaus of this  i feel it   s appropri to character inflat risk as have increas  thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   the seventh district economi appear to be expand at a moder rate  similar to what i report at our last meet   as we talk with busi contact  we heard mix review regard activ across differ sector of the economi   on the downsid  everyon in the construct industri  from builder to supplier  had grim assess  and our contact with the detroit three character the vehicl market as mediocr   anoth negat is on the labor front   our contact at manpow report that demand for temporari worker was down a lot   he said that the current market felt almost as it did in       kelli   s assess was not quit so negat  although they did say that some indic were flash yellow   of cours  the bls has been show declin in temp help employ sinc earli       and most other indic point to a healthi labor market   inde  we continu to hear about firm tri to cope with shortag of skill worker   for instanc  a coupl of heavi equip manufactur base in illinoi said that they were recruit engin from the detroit area   that was encourag   there were other upbeat report on activ   unit airlin said that all their market were quit good  appar better than presid   was report earlier  they note the book for busi travel  which can be an indic of busi   s more general willing to spend  remain strong in octob and novemb   intern book also were extrem good   we heard numer report of strong export demand   for exampl  for machin tool manufactur and heavi equip produc   with regard to the financi situat  i continu to hear that there is a disconnect between wall street and main street   import  except for construct  our contact do not see nonfinanci firm be constrain by a lack of access to credit or by the price of credit  turn to the macroeconomi  the news on econom activ that we   ve receiv over the past six week has been better than the downsid scenario that we fear   inde  it has been better than what we had assum in our baselin forecast in septemb   like the  book  we have rais our outlook for growth in the second half of      about    percentag point   residenti invest   look a bit wors than we thought  but consumpt came in a good deal stronger than we had expect   also  the incom news about labor market  includ the revis to employ in august  point to continu support to household spend from growth in job and incom   unlik the  book  we mark up the outlook for activ a bit in      and        our current project see growth recov to a littl abov potenti in the second half of next year and in       with regard to inflat  the incom price data have been posit  and we have revis down our forecast for inflat a bit  to about    percent in      and        i think the risk to this forecast are two side   some of our statist model translat the incom data into quit low forecast for inflat in      and      if you take them at face valu   but higher cost for energi and other materi  the weaker dollar  and potenti pressur from resourc util still pose some risk that inflat will come in higher than we current are forecast   for me  the posit inflat develop are an import ingredi allow us to focus on risk manag   sinc risk manag consider have play a key role in our polici decis  it is import to think about how the risk to the forecast have chang sinc septemb   last  e and today  dave   cite sever downsid risk to watch for   an intensifi fallout from the problem in mortgag financ onto hous demand  a substanti drop in consum sen ent  and a spillov from financi market disrupt to busi spend   these high cost scenario are possibl  but i think their likelihood is smaller than they were in septemb   we have been pessimist on hous for a while  and for onc  despit dave     s warn  i am encourag that the  book   s forecast for      has not been mark down materi   it is a small comfort  but just a bit   the economi outsid of hous seem to have enter the fourth quarter with more momentum than we had thought it would   import  consumpt growth has been solid even though there has been anoth downtick in sen ent  on the financi front  the  book point to the special beig book capit spend question and to the senior loan offic survey as signal that we could expect more spillov to nonfinanci activ   tighter standard for c i loan are definit news  but they are hard surpris   the real news will be next quarter   look at previous survey  we had one bad quarter in       and then it came down  and then the later tighten was part of the increas in the fed fund rate   so i think that the next quarter will be veri inform and import   in assess how risk have chang  these survey need to be balanc against the improv we have seen in credit market   while i continu to be concern about collater damag from the credit market to real activ  i still think the problem in financi market are like to remain larg wall off from the nonfinanci economi   so on balanc  the econom outlook has improv  and the risk of financi contagion have diminish somewhat sinc septemb  although they haven   t disappear   thank you  mr  chairman

thank you  mr  chairman   there realli have not been ani signific chang in econom condit or trend in the district   moder expans is continu   the special survey we did on financi condit and whether the chang there had affect capit spend plan suggest that plan  at least for firm in our district  were larg unaffect  contact with insight into the ship industri do report that export are veri strong  stronger than at least they had anticip   that  of cours  is consist with what we have been see in some of the aggreg data  as far as the nation economi is concern  i agre with the  book   s assess of the incom inform that we receiv sinc the last committe meet   i won   t rehash it here  except to say that the surpris have been posit  a bit on the upsid  and i think we still   at least at the aggreg level   haven   t seen general spillov from the contract in hous activ or price on overal econom activ   i also agre with the  book   s assess of the outlook for the economi for the next two or three quarter   i think growth is like to be subdu as a consequ of the chang in financi condit that we   ve seen   as far as price are concern  core inflat seem to me to be relat well contain at least on a year over year basi  and i expect that perform to be maintain as long as we pursu appropri polici  look at the overal econom outlook beyond the next two or three quarter  i think there is a reason chanc  given recent develop and recent action  that by the middl of next year  say  we   ll be look at real econom growth of someth close to what the economi has averag over the past six year   that is  the period      through        this is a bit more favor  a bit higher  than the  book outlook  and as best i can judg  the  book is more conserv than i am about the nonconsumpt  nonresidenti invest compon of aggreg demand   put anoth way  those compon add a bit less to aggreg demand in the  book than i would expect   but my real point is that i don   t think it is a great stretch to see pretti respect growth by the middl of next year   my read of the project packag that was briefli discuss earlier suggest to me that at least some have the same view   of cours  that improv could occur even sooner given the uncertainti associ with forecast short term perturb in the economi   thank you
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to concentr on the outlook for the nonhous part   i think the hous sector is obvious in miser condit  and the issu as to where that   s go to go realli depend on how much of it spread to other part of the economi  now  i have a contact with a larg softwar firm  and the headlin there is that thing are go great   in fact  go gangbust  i would say   comput hardwar sale nation are run at    to    percent abov last year  about   percentag point abov expect   busi it growth is around    percent   export sale are good   server busi is good   comput game softwar is strong   just overal a veri bullish outlook there   capit expenditur at this compani are up about    percent this fiscal year over last fiscal year and are expect to be up anoth    percent in fiscal        so the outlook is uniform veri  veri strong   the compani say it is behind in hire and has lot of unfil posit part as a consequ of turnov  now  all the other contact were pretti downbeat   up is expect a peak season that is milder than in the previous year  my contact believ that the economi is not go into a negat but is clear slow down   the compani is leas eleven fewer aircraft this year   to meet the peak  they alway leas extra plane for ship   they are probabl hold about steadi on capit outlay   my contact at fedex say that the outlook is veri soft  not much buildup toward the holiday peak   the retail that they talk to are anticip a softer season  not an absolut declin  but slow growth   intern busi remain veri strong   this compani is reduc capit expenditur by    percent from it previous expect   my contact in a major compani in the truck industri say that we are in a recess  the worst he has seen in twenti to forti year  the compani is reduc it fleet size by    percent  is cut capit spend quit substanti  and has no good news   a contact with a major money center bank said that the bank   s analysi of credit card usag indic that sale have been flat in some area and are declin in other   credit card usag for depart store and catalogu sale has been declin   in an e mail i receiv after that convers  my contact paint a weaker pictur than had been discuss the previous day   i think that there are other comment around the tabl suggest that the anecdot report are a bit on the weak side  now  to me there is a puzzl in the market   s assess of the outcom of this meet  the market has essenti bid in a probabl of     of either a    or a    basi point cut   if i were simpli follow the flow of news  the general flow of news put hous asid has been okay  mayb a littl stronger than expect  and follow this fed fund futur market for a long  e  it   respond to the current inform   the flow of data clear move that market  and if that were all that were drive the market  i guess i would have anticip a       split between no chang in the fed fund target and down    basi point   so whi has the market bid in such a high probabl of a cut at this  e   i   ll offer a hypothesi  which is that a number of peopl who are player in this market  like my contact at a larg bank  are look at news and say that the proprietari insid inform they have on what   s go on lead them to believ that the overal economi has a soft tone to it that is not yet show up in the data that we follow   i   m throw out that hypothesi   i don   t know what other hypothesi to offer  but it   seem to be a reason one   thank you
thank you   we have been extraordinarili effici today  whi don   t we take a coffe break and come back at        coffe break
let   s reconven   vice chairman
i just want to start by say in defens of the empir state that there is no way   the onli way that richmond could be bigger than new york and philadelphia is if you don   t count the substanti busi we have in the manufactur of financi product
it   s a lot smaller busi than it use to be   laughter
as the chairman said at the econom club of new york  it is like to emerg stronger   i think the outlook look about the way it did in septemb  just a few quick point   financi market condit are substanti better than dure the peak of the panic in mid august  but the improv  as mani of you said  is still quit limit and uneven   sen ent is still quit fragil  and i think we still seem like to face a protract period of adjust ahead as the market work through the substanti array of challeng remain  growth in the unit state and in the world economi in my view seem like to slow   more here  of cours  than elsewher   here  even though the nonhous  non auto part of the u s  economi don   t yet show signific evid of a consider slowdown of actual or expect demand  i think that still seem like   in our central scenario  though  hous construct weaken further   hous demand slow further becaus of the tighten of credit condit  price fall further   consum spend slow a bit  and busi react by scale back growth in hire and invest  and this produc sever quarter of growth modest below trend   i think that growth outsid the unit state is like to slow a bit   it will slow toward potenti  if not all the way to potenti  in those economi that have been grow abov potenti   although the world is larger in relat term and somewhat less vulner to a u s  slowdown than it onc was  it seem to me veri unlik that domest demand in the rest of the world will acceler as domest demand slow in the unit state   so the risk to this outlook for u s  growth still seem to lie to the downsid   the magnitud of the downsid risk may be slight less than in septemb  but they remain substanti   i think the main sourc of this downsid risk to growth is the interact between expect of recess probabl and the credit market dynam   each feed the other   as the outlook for hous deterior and the recess probabl stay elev  financi institut and investor stay cautious   that caution  in turn  slow the pace of recoveri in market   in asset back  securit  and structur credit market   and in credit growth more broad   as expect adjust to anticip a longer  more substanti period of impair in market  then recess probabl at least potenti increas  i think that the under inflat number and the measur we use to captur under inflat do not suggest ani meaning acceler in under inflat  and we still expect the core pce to run at a rate below   percent over the forecast period   in some way  though  the inflat outlook now feel a bit wors   it feel wors becaus of the modest rise in breakeven that we saw follow our last meet and becaus of sen ent in market around gold  commod and energi price  and the dollar   the fact that breakeven at long horizon have risen or fail to fall as monetari polici expect have shift down is not the most comfort pattern out there  so i think we need to be veri care not to encourag ani sens in market that we   re indiffer to those potenti risk   have said that  i think the risk to that inflat forecast are rough balanc  the rang of tool we have for measur equilibrium combin with what you see in financi market expect suggest that monetari polici  to assess the real short term interest rate  is at or abov most es  of neutral and  therefor  is still exert some modest restraint on growth   the expect now built into market impli too much eas over the next eighteen month  more than i think we   re like to have to do   but i think the appropri path of monetari polici lie under the  book   s assumpt   thank you
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   in broad outlin  the situat is evolv as we anticip in our last meet   spend outsid of hous has been well maintain   the hous market is veri weak   financi market have been return more toward normal function  bank have tighten credit term and standard  and core inflat has remain low   i think it is the nuanc around each of these that complic our decis at this meet  as dave   and other point out  spend outsid hous has been a bit stronger than expect   path of consumpt and invest  along with employ  seem to be moder go into the fourth quarter  but gradual   import  the data for septemb haven   t been especi weak  and these could have potenti been affect by the financi tighten  increas uncertainti  and reduc consum confid that follow the event of august   with growth in the third quarter like to be at or abov   percent and no materi chang in the output gap for sever quarter now  it   appear that the real fund rate of   percent plus that persist sinc mid       while quit high relat to histor averag  was not far from the equilibrium real rate at that  e  given the low level of long term rate  the readi avail of credit at histor low spread  and the high level of wealth relat to incom through this period   it seem somewher between difficult and imposs to calibr the effect on aggreg demand of the rise in long term rate last spring  the tighten of credit condit of the past few month  and the expect declin in hous price   the staff has judg    basi point of eas   we did that at the last meet   to be enough to keep the economi near it potenti in the context of the relat solid incom data   that  sn   t seem unreason  though it   leav the fed fund rate at the higher end of it histor rang  nonetheless  i see a coupl of reason for import downsid risk to such a growth forecast   first  though the hous market was rough in line with staff forecast  builder have made onli a littl progress in reduc inventori overhang   moreov  report suggest that downward price pressur are increas   for exampl  the constant qualiti new home index declin in the past two quarter   market expect for the case shiller index revis down  suggest that the drop in hous price could be steeper than the moder drop assum in the staff forecast   substanti decreas in hous price would at some point reviv the demand for hous   at the same  e  that declin threaten greater spillov from wealth effect on consumpt and from tighter credit condit as lender react to threat to their capit from declin collater valu   second  although financi market are improv in mani respect  the trajectori is gradual  uneven  and subject to revers   we saw this just in the past coupl of week  when advers hous data  downgrad of high rate mortgag and senior tranch  and earn warn caus some risk spread to widen out   the secondari market for nonconform mortgag are still quit disrupt   clear  uncertainti about the price of mani of the asset in question  about the amount of credit that will get put back to the bank balanc sheet  and about the size and locat of the loss that have to be taken continu to make lender veri skittish   in this environ  i wouldn   t be at all surpris to see a further tighten of credit avail at bank in the come month   the develop in hous and financi market are also like to weigh on busi spend plan  as we saw hint at in the capit spend revis that some of the reserv bank report  and for household as evidenc by the low confid survey  these downsid risk are strong enough that i think they will persist even if we eas slight tomorrow   besid the influenc i alreadi cite  my judgment in this regard take account of market expect   the market    impli r  has been below the staff   s and  i think  the committe   s impli r  for some  e now  but the gap seem to have widen consider   in an environ of increas uncertainti about the outlook  such dispar perhap aren   t surpris  and we can   t substitut market particip    judgment for our own  but i did take a littl signal from the extent of the pessim about aggreg demand that i infer from the interest rate path in the market relat to the staff   s path in the  book   i don   t think r  is quit as low as presid   was suggest   it is perhap in the   to     rang sinc term premium are still low  and even with hous price declin  the wealth to incom ratio are still pretti high  and the dollar has been fall  but i did assum a slight eas of monetari polici some  in the fourth quarter in my project   i also project low  stabl core and ul  total inflat  but i do see some upsid risk around this outcom if the economi follow it most like path   it is still produc at a high level of resourc util  and some measur of compens and labor cost have been rise  core cpi inflat on three month and six month base has acceler even if the acceler hasn   t shown through to the pce measur   increas in energi and commod price  along with recent declin of the dollar  are also a risk factor   less from their direct effect on price  which are like to be small  but more becaus they could suggest a potenti for a more inflationari psycholog that could feed through to expect   our decis tomorrow will involv weigh these risk  the extent of the relat risk to our dual object  and the potenti cost of miss in either direct in the context of the market condit and expect built into market   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought i   d just talk about four subject today  first  spend a few more moment on the capit market condit  which bill did a great job of summar  second  talk about financi intermediari  and third and fourth  talk briefli about implic for growth and inflat   in term of the capit market  i think it is import that we judg their state today not from where they might have been two week ago or from where they might have gotten ahead of under realiti   if you look at credit spread and equiti   but from where they were befor we last met or from where they were in the darkest day of august   i think these market are at the veri high end of what are reason expect for improv   as governor kohn suggest  it  sn   t mean that they can   t revers themselv   it certain  sn   t mean that they are solid   plenti of fragil is there   but all thing consid  as a function of both  e and fed polici  there is  inde  better sen ent  bid ask spread have narrow  price discoveri is at work  and differenti and tier are veri real   i   d highlight a few market that have gone into the categori of be on more solid ground   bill refer to the interbank fund market   the multisel bank sponsor conduit is perform well   prime auto financ paper has gone through quit a volatil period in the past coupl of month but has now found it way to the good side  where i think those market are increas open   high qualiti paper is increas be receiv on term that don   t look dramat differ from the way they would have look befor august   anoth exampl is credit card receiv  of cours  as mani other around this tabl have point out  there is no panacea   serious problem remain in some asset market  particular hous and certain part of structur financ  but i note that might be for good reason   i   d hesit to call this poor market function   by and larg  it may be that some investor don   t like the outcom  but as the asset back commerci paper market have separ the have from the have not and the have not are without bank sponsorship and have poorer qualiti asset and poorer disclosur  they are have a hard  e find and secur bid   anoth exampl might be some larg financi institut that are roll over more of their fund on a shorter term basi than they desir   there may be good reason for that  and as we think about our polici tool tomorrow  we shouldn   t tri to come to the rescu with ani fix for institut that may not have been manag well or  at least  may not have had a capit structur that fit the risk   there are a coupl of other indic of continu concern  obvious  the treasuri bill market has been quit volatil and is a pretti good remind to us that these market are not back to anyth that we   d even want to consid normal   anoth indic that i look to in evalu whether the capit market are come back to some normalci is the percentag of cash hold in money market mutual fund   in the pre juli period  money market mutual fund  particular those that hold these prime plus secur  would hold   to    percent of their asset in cash   on the darkest day in august  that was up to    percent   by and larg  my sens is that the averag now is someth in the mid   s   that suggest that there might be request for redempt and liquid for which they need to keep cash avail  but they are feel a littl better about their prospect and about some of the paper that they   re hold  on balanc  i   d say it   s pretti easi for us to sit here and judg improv   it   s a lot harder for us to judg success   i think presid   talk about the normal in these market  and we must hesit to think that the market befor their august turmoil were normal  risk premium were abnorm low  and access to credit perhap unusu easi   so in judg the success of  e in our polici prescript  i think we   re have a hard  e   at least i   m have a hard  e   figur out what are the new steadi state outcom that are tri to be achiev  these market appear delic balanc between fear and greed   one exampl of greed  as we discuss in previous meet  is some of the pay in kind  or pik  secur with toggl featur in the high yield market   one of them was price just last week between    and      so some of these corpor credit may well have improv in the eye of the market beyond what we think might be sustain   on the other side is fear   a new paradigm is tri to take root in the market  but the risk of revers remain veri real   the mark on mani leverag loan look good   but if you judg the financi institut that hold this paper  they are rush to get the paper to market as soon as they possibl can  perhap with a view that the corpor credit condit won   t hold at these level  second  let me talk briefli about financi intermediari   as we discuss befor  after the tumult in mid august  mani of them retrench   then mani of them tri to re liquefi   at that  e they were tri to revalu their secur   now they are probabl somewher in the process of revalu  review  and refin   some of them  after the earn announc of the past coupl of week  might be go back to step   and tri to understand what the risk are and what their liabil are   some of the improv that we saw in the capit market after our septemb    meet might have been upend or seem so by a coupl of announc from a lead invest bank and commerci bank that repres a negat surpris to the market  a coupl of explan are possibl for whi the market seem to react not just with respect to the secur of those two bank   were the loss and risk manag system particular to those bank that call the risk manag into question  or were they illustr of loss to larger segment of their peer group owe to poor risk manag system   it was probabl a combin  but i guess the key question for me is whether we are see impair of the entir financi sector or simpli the realign of the competit landscap   i think the answer is the latter  but i   m not certain   the best in class compar among commerci bank and invest bank seem to suggest that bifurc is at work   if you look at the credit default swap  at the profit  and at the share price for the best in class of this group  they seem to have come out of the scare of a coupl of week ago stronger and more profit and  frank  in much better shape   i would have thought that those sort of entiti would be put opportunist capit to work in a hurri  particular when mani of their competitor are down   i   m afraid that is not the case   even they are play defens in this market   we talk  i talk  about the resili of our capit market  what they tell mani of us  i think  is that the way for them to be resili is to be except prudent here   the risk reward tradeoff for them suggest that this is a  e to be care   you can   t succeed if you don   t surviv  and i suspect that mani of them are still quit jar by recent event  the profit of most of these financi institut has been signific call into question   i suspect that the loss in the fourth quarter are go to look particular bad  but i would expect that mani of these financi institut are ask themselv the question of what busi they realli should be in after all  third  let me speak briefli about the implic for econom growth   to me there is no question that we have less market uncertainti than two month ago  and the prospect of some realli bad tail event have dissip somewhat  but there is still caution  as vice chairman   said   certain  larg multin nonfinanci compani  exclud hous  seem to be hold up well  as repres by their bottom up s p earn forecast for the fourth quarter of next year  and certain there   s good news to report  as presid pool suggest  from mani in the tech sector   hous is  of cours  as bad as the  book has long suggest   so at the end of the day in term of tri to judg what   s go on in the real economi  we go back to a discuss the  book highlight for us  which is the state of the consum   even though on balanc i am a bit more op ist than the  book for gdp growth for the balanc of       and        i have to admit that the conclus that consum sen ent has taken a hit seem  at least from my read and my discuss with some busi leader  to be back up by some veri disappoint consum spend for octob   have survey a few of the credit card compani  i think that it look to mani of them that octob spend is realli not at comfort level   nomin spend exclud fuel for their consum base appear flat to down over the past four week   that is  i think  a rather remark outcom   delinqu have also tick up a bit  but i would say that   s probabl less disconcert to me than what the credit card compani seem to be report as a proxi for retail spend   the key over the medium term  howev  is job growth and real dispos incom  in my judgment more import than the negat wealth effect from hous  let me turn to the final issu for discuss   at least on my list   which is inflat risk  at the end of this six week period  i must admit to be consider less sanguin about inflat prospect and risk than the  book   it is true that incom data have not been bad at all   some have even been pretti good  and inflat expect are seem anchor   but as governor kohn suggest  i worri a lot about inflat psycholog and the real effect of import inflat given dollar weak and the effect of commod price increas pass through on a breadth of product   given the massiv liquid on the sidelin  given uncertainti in the global capit market and the current polit calendar  and given the rather larg and grow expect discrep in interest rate differenti between us and our trade partner  i worri about outsiz move between the u s  dollar and foreign currenc   a disord move in the dollar could prove veri cost  even undermin foreign direct invest in the unit state and perhap threaten to unanchor inflat expect  particular if the judgment of this committe aren   t well understood by the market   i have never been a big believ in look at artifici level for price or at chart to figur out where we should worri   nonetheless  i must say a euro dollar move beyond     strike me as a level that the market will be pay keen attent to   we   ll obvious talk about the polici tradeoff involv these risk in the next round   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you veri much   i veri much agre with dave   s character of the  book as a modal forecast  and i think it is an excel and perfect reason modal forecast   as almost all of us have said  the data are come in a littl stronger  we will have a fair amount of momentum go into the fourth quarter   we will have a signific drag from hous in         the financi market outsid of hous have general had fair signific improv  although a lot of brittl remain   a veri clear exampl of that is how the market seem to flatten out in the past week or so and certain market back up a bit  and thus the risk spread are widen   it is also interest to note that  when the first earn report that were fair negat were come out  there was a posit market reaction becaus it was sort of a relief that they were own up to the challeng   now that more inform is come out  some of which is more negat than had been expect  the market   s reaction have been more negat  and some of the risk spread have been widen  that suggest that a lot of concern is still out there  and a lot of peopl are wait for the other shoe to drop   i will note that i am sure that other shoe will have been manufactur in richmond    laughter  sinc this was a modal forecast  i want to think about a downsid scenario  one on which i put a reason amount of probabl mass and one that i think we should serious consid  a number of peopl have talk about bank balanc sheet   general  there has been less concern about them than befor   one of the big issu that we had focus on earlier was leverag lend   that seem to be work itself out reason well without much incid  there is obvious a lower new flow on  but the new flow   have coven  et cetera   so that seem to be work out reason   abcp  siv  conduit   there is still uncertainti about how much may come onto the balanc sheet  although there is a lot more comfort with the extent of the call on the capit that is there  but there is still uncertainti as to how much might be call   you know  the siv seem to be work themselv down   they are shrink through order asset sale   but  of cours  what are they do   they are sell the best asset first  so the potenti challeng are still left behind   for the bank  the conform mortgag are easi to get off the balanc sheet   there seem to be a debat about whether bank are choos not to get nonconform one off the balanc sheet or whether they can   t get them off the balanc sheet   mani organ that have a lot of capit seem to be just origin these wholli on the balanc sheet and wait for better price  as we have heard report from other institut say that they are readi  will  and abl to buy at a good price and the suppli just isn   t there  nonetheless  there is still much more care in the underwrit of those loan  obvious  the jumbo mortgag  the nonconform mortgag  are more import than they use to be becaus hous price have run up so much around the countri             sn   t buy you as much hous anymor  even in part of the countri that don   t have or tradit have not had particular high hous price   that rais a concern about a squeez through the mortgag market   so i see that the consequ of the financi turbul is primarili highlight issu in the mortgag market  as a number of peopl have said   also  as i think the  book and bluebook point out  it is not a problem for high rate or even just moder well rate corpor to get fund   that is not a challeng right now   it seem main to be come through the hous market  so i see a potenti for a slow burn scenario come and for the hous market to slowli play itself out becaus we are go to have continu negat shock   more than         reset are go to be come everi quarter  start with this quarter  through        as a number of peopl have note  we have much higher credit standard than befor   mani of the peopl who were suppli subprim loan no longer exist  and those who are suppli them are suppli them at much  much higher standard   we will be propos and put out new rule   the congress is consid new rule   this is all cast a pall over peopl who might potenti be suppli credit into some of these market   the delinqu and foreclosur are clear go to continu rise at least for a few quarter  probabl   as analysi by some peopl at the board suggest   peak in mid        but there is still a lot of uncertainti with respect to that   so it is go to continu to put more and more challeng in this market  all of these thing come togeth could put a lot more pressur on hous price   i think we have been see some signific declin in hous construct  but i see a potenti for a reason likelihood of a much larger negat hous price effect than what the  book has   as a shred of evid for that  the incred illiquid case shiller index that is trade on the mercantil exchang  if you look forward  for a number of market they have a cumul declin of    percent over a coupl of year   now  the number of player may be no more than the number of finger that i have  but still it is a piec of data suggest that it could be lower  the anecdot report are that real hous price are much lower than the index are indic  certain  in the new market  they are throw in a lot of extra  add on  et cetera  and the inventori may actual be larger becaus the anecdot report are that a lot of peopl are take their hous off the market  so they are not formal includ in the enorm inventori that are out there but may well be potenti there for suppli  so what   this suggest go forward   well  from a risk manag perspect  we ought to be think about buy insur against this downsid scenario   what is the cost of insur   inflat and inflat expect   as most peopl have mention  we have seen some gradual slow and expect are still be contain but  as governor kohn point out  there is a bit of an uptick in the cpi  which is definit worrisom   but what is the risk  well  let us think about the upsid risk   i go back to       when the fomc cut    basi point  growth was     percent in      and     percent in        as i mention last  e  we saw veri littl increas in inflat   actual a declin in core inflat   i look at the core pce in addit to the core cpi that i report last  e  and that was effect flat at          percent in       and       and then     percent again in        the potenti benefit of buy a littl insur now is that  given that a lot of these challeng may be peak in mid       it may have some effect down the line   it provid perhap a bit more insur against some of the negat shock that we may be hear about   if those other shoe do drop over the next few month  then we have a lower downsid risk for broader financi turbul   also  by mid       if the scenario that i am describ or the other negat scenario that peopl have describ  aren   t materi  we can take back some of these move   thank you
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   my forecast is actual quit similar to the  book forecast   in term of inflat  i see a littl fa  movement back to   percent  where i think inflat expect are ground  but the differ is veri minor   i do think the risk are quit balanc around that   in term of econom growth  i am fair comfort with the  book forecast  mayb a smidgen less sanguin in the next two quarter but realli not veri differ   howev  in term of the issu of potenti downsid risk  i do think that  given the polici path that the  book assess  there are substanti downsid risk and they come from sever sourc   one sourc is that the financi market disrupt have led to some tighten of lend standard   i think that could have some potenti effect on busi invest   the hous market is pretti grim   we still have a big inventori overhang  and there is a question about whether that larg inventori overhang is go to lead to even fewer hous start than the  book has forecast   furthermor  it has rais the issu about hous price  which have spillov into household spend   the spread for commerci real estat are still veri high  and so there is a question about whether commerci real estat will be as strong as it has been   that is a bit worrisom as well   consum confid has not deterior too much  but it has been on a path of deterior   so  again  i worri a littl about what the consum might do   in general  i worri more about these downsid risk  given the polici path of keep the feder fund rate constant  what about the financi market and their disrupt   well  i think that there are two element to the disrupt in these big  widen credit spread   one is the valuat risk   all of a sudden peopl realiz that they didn   t know as much about what kind of asset were in portfolio and how complic the structur were in term of those asset   clear  the solut to that problem is price discoveri   we see that happen  but it is go to be veri slow   so that problem  in term of the credit market  will take a fair amount of  e to resolv   the second element is what i call macro risk  which is the concern about a downward spiral   the problem in the credit market will lead to a weaken of the economi  which then make price discoveri harder to do  which mean that you have wider credit spread  which then make thing wors   of cours  that   s the issu with the tail risk that all of us have been talk about   i think the polici chang that we did in septemb clear had a big impact   it did exact what we want it to do   it is almost a textbook case in do what we want it to do   it took out a lot of the macro risk   it didn   t take out the valuat risk  which is get better but veri slowli over  e  so look at this issu and think about go forward in term of the credit market  i am a littl worri that credit market are still quit skittish   that has sever element   one is the danger that macro risk could come back   so there is a question about shoe drop   there is an issu about what we might do at this meet  and then there are issu about what might actual happen that peopl don   t know about   one thing that is sort of surpris is that  when you look at what is happen in credit spread  they seem pretti reason in their steadi but veri slow improv   but then  you sens some discomfort   in particular  the reaction to the treasuri superconduit has not been veri posit   if it work  it would actual reveal inform becaus it would look like the way that the old clearinghous use to work  when they would combin asset   randi know all about this becaus he studi this stuff   you pool your asset  then you monitor each other  and then you actual creat inform that make the market work better   i think that is what the treasuri was tri to get at   but the skeptic in the market is such that they think this could be use to hide inform about asset and that other shoe may be drop in this regard   this   not give me a lot of confid  and so i worri veri much at this junctur  which i think is a critic one  that a polici move could have an effect of send the credit market in a bad direct   that is someth we have to take into account tomorrow   thank you
thank you   thank you everyon   let me tri to summar this discuss   it is a littl harder than usual   broad  the macroeconom news came in slight better than expect dure the intermeet period   hous has been veri weak  as expect  but consumpt  invest  and net export were relat strong in recent month  in the aggreg data  there is yet no clear sign of a spillov from hous   most particip expect sever weak quarter follow by recoveri later next year  the risk remain to the downsid but may be less than at our last meet   one issu  given all these factor  is determin the equilibrium short term interest rate   financi market condit have improv somewhat sinc our last meet  with investor discrimin among borrow and with the process of price discoveri proceed   there was general agreement that condit are not back to normal and that it would be some  e befor that happen   some suggest that a risk of relaps remain  should credit qualiti worsen or further bad news be disclos   lend condit have tighten  particular for mortgag  and securit remain impair   there is not yet much evid that this tighten is affect busi borrow  howev  although financi condit may have somewhat increas uncertainti among busi leader  view on how consumpt would evolv were mix   consum sen ent is on the weak side  hous price are down  and oil price are up  which suggest some weaken ahead  howev  the labor market remain reason solid  which should support consum spend  anecdot inform about consum spend was unusu mix   some saw evid of grow weak in consumpt   this evid includ weak report from shipper and credit card compani   other saw the consum side as slow a bit but general healthi  invest  includ invest in commerci real estat  may also be slow somewhat  but again  the evid is mix   manufactur growth appear to be moder   other sector   includ energi  agricultur  high tech  and tourism   are do well   core inflat has moder  and there was general more comfort that this improv would persist   there was less concern express about tight in labor market and wage pressur   energi price and food price could lead total inflat to rise  perhap even into next year  and there is the risk of pass through to the core   similar concern appli to the dollar and to export price   some  but not all  tip base measur of inflat expect have risen  and survey base measur have been stabl   most particip saw inflat risk to the upsid  but at least some saw them as less press than earlier this year   that is my summari   comment  well  again  as usual  it is hard to be the last person to speak  but let me make just a few comment   first  as alway  the  book was veri thought   the author have done a good job of balanc the risk  and i find their forecast veri plausibl as a modal forecast   hous   seem to be veri weak  of cours  and manufactur look to be slow further   but except for those sector  there is a good bit of momentum still in the economi   have said that  i think there is an unusu amount of uncertainti around the modal forecast  mayb less than in septemb but still a great deal  let me talk briefli about three area   financi market  hous  and inflat   a lot of peopl have alreadi spoken about financi market   market function certain has improv  our action in septemb help on that   for exampl  commerci paper market are work almost normal for good borrow  the spread are down  and volum are stabl   one concern that we had for quit a while was that bank would be face bind balanc sheet constraint becaus of all the conting liabil that they had   off balanc sheet vehicl  leverag loan  and so on   that problem seem to be somewhat less than it was   some of the leverag loan are be sold off  some of the worst off balanc sheet vehicl are be wound down   so there is general improv in the financi market  certain   in the past coupl of week there has been some deterior in sen ent  and i see that as come from essenti two factor   first  there were a number of report of unusu larg and unanticip loss  which reduc the confid of investor that we had detect and unearth all the bad news   this problem will eventu be resolv  but clear we still have some way to go to clarifi where peopl stand   the other issu  which i think is more pertin to our discuss  is about econom fundament   there was a veri bad respons  for exampl  to caterpillar   s profit report  and so the market is appropri respond to econom fundament as they feed through into credit concern  from our perspect  one of the key issu will be the avail of credit to consum and firm go forward   my sens   base on my talk to supervisor  look at the senior loan offic survey  and talk to some peopl in the market   is that bank are becom quit conserv  and that is what kevin said   it is not necessarili a balanc sheet constraint but more a concern about renew weak in market   it is also a concern about the condit of borrow  about credit risk  and the demand of investor for veri tight underwrit   now  of cours  tight underwrit is not a bad thing  it is a good thing   but from our perspect  we need to think about it potenti implic for growth and  if you like  for r    the biggest effect of the tighter underwrit  of cours  has been on mortgag loan  although we have seen a bit of improv in the secondari market for prime jumbo  which is encourag if that continu   this is the area in which vicious circl effect  which vice chairman   and other have talk about  is most concern   hous price  accord to the  book  are project to fall     percent over the next two year   clear  there is some downsid risk to that  if hous price were to fall much more  that would feed into credit evalu  into balanc sheet  back into credit extens  and so on   so i think there is a risk there  as governor   and governor   also discuss   the corpor sector is not much of a problem  good firm are issu debt without much problem   i don   t realli have much read on small busi  but i have not heard much complain in that area either   with respect to consum  my guess is that we are go to see some effect on consum   certain  home equiti loan and instal loan have tighten up   we can see that in the senior loan offic survey   we don   t see that yet for credit card  but sinc a lot of credit card are use by peopl with subprim credit histori  i suspect that we will see some tighten there   so i do expect to see some effect on consum from credit condit  as has alreadi been mention  an area we also need to note is commerci real estat  financ condit have alreadi tighten there quit consider  and spread are much wider   the senior loan offic survey show the tighten of term and condit that match previous recess  and cmbs issuanc has drop veri signific   you can debat whether or not this tighten is justifi by fundament   on the one hand  vacanc rate remain low  and rent are high   on the other hand  it is still also true that price to rent ratio are quit high   if you calcul an equiti risk premium for commerci real estat analog to the way you calcul one for stock  you would find that it is at an unusu low level  which would tend to suggest that price may fall   so it is uncertain  i would say   certain one area in which we might see further retrench in commerci real estat is the public sector   tax receipt are slow  and that might affect build decis   so i do think this is anoth area in which we will be see some effect from credit tighten   i should be clear   the  book alreadi incorpor a consider slowdown in commerci real estat  but that mean it will no longer offset the residenti slowdown  i just want to make one comment about hous  which i think we all agre is a central sourc of uncertainti  both for the credit reason i have discuss and in term of price  wealth  and other issu   let me just make one point that i found strike anyway  which is that   at least from the  book   the forecast of a strengthen economi by next spring and the second half of next year is veri close tie to the assumpt that hous will turn around next spring   in particular  if you look at all the final demand compon for the economi  other than hous  in      those compon contribut     percentag point to gdp   accord to the  book forecast  in      all those compon togeth will contribut     percentag point to gdp   so the fact that gdp  sn   t slow ani more than     come from the assumpt that the negat contribut of hous next year will be much less than it was in this year   it is certain possibl   again  i think the  book author have done a good job of balanc the risk   but as we have note  we have miss this turn befor  and it could happen again   so let me just note that as an import issu   if we do miss on that turn  the other forecast error for consumpt and so on obvious would be correl with that miss  final  let me talk for a moment about inflat   i want to share the concern that some peopl have note   if you want to be defens about inflat  you could point out that the movement in oil price and the dollar and so on is in part due to our action   but it is also due to a lot of other thing   for exampl  the dollar in broad real term is about where it was in the late      s   in that respect  it is perhap about where it should be in term of tri to make progress on the current account deficit   similar  with oil  a lot of other factor besid monetari polici are involv   that said  i share with governor   the concern that the visibl of these indic day after day in financi market and on televis screen has a risk of affect inflat psycholog   i do worri about that   i think we should pay attent to that   so i do think that is a concern  and we obvious need to take it into consider in our polici  in our statement  and in our public remark  i have one more comment on hous befor end   in think about the turnaround for hous next year  governor   talk about reset and those sort of issu   we spend a lot of  e here at the board think about differ plan for refinanc subprim borrow or other borrow into sustain mortgag   we have look at the fha and other type of approach   a veri interest paper by an economist name joseph mason at drexel discuss  at a veri detail institut level  the issu relat to refinanc  in term both of the servic    incent and of the regulatori perspect   mason point out that there are some serious regulatori problem with the massiv refinanc effort  includ consum protect issu  becaus refinanc can be a sourc of scam   there are also issu of safeti and sound becaus refinanc can be a way to disguis loss  for exampl   if you read that paper  i think you will be persuad   at least i am becom increas persuad   that a signific amount of refinanc will not be happen and that we will see substanti financi problem and foreclosur that will peak somewher in the middl of next year   so i think that is an addit risk that we ought to take into account as we think about the evolut of hous  those are just a few comment on the general outlook   let me just note  we will adjourn in a moment   there will be a recept and a dinner  for those of you who wish to stay   there will be no program or busi  so if you have other plan  feel free to pursu them   a number of piec of data  includ gdp  will arriv overnight  and we will begin tomorrow morn with a discuss of the new data   perhap that will help us in our discuss of polici   thank you   the meet is adjourn   meet recess  octob               of     octob            morn session
good morn  everybodi   let   s start with dave    who will bring us up to date on the overnight data releas
we left at your place   and i hope you will find   a tabl show the gdp releas number relat to the  book forecast that we had   i thought i would start out by just walk you through that for a minut and give my impress of what it implic are   as you can see  there was an advanc es  of third quarter gdp of     percent   that was     percentag point abov our es  for the third quarter   look at the second line of the tabl  you can see final sale   we were actual surpris a bit to the downsid   just a tenth   by final sale   the real area of surpris in this releas  if you look further down the tabl to the level in chain      dollar  was the chang in nonfarm inventori   the bea has a much higher es  for third quarter inventori invest than we do   typic that chang  sn   t carri a great mani implic for us go forward   if anyth  if we hold inventori invest at the level that we project for the fourth quarter  the higher level that they are es  for the third quarter would actual lead to a reduct in our es  of fourth quarter gdp  go back just briefli to the compon of final sale  as you can see  two area explain most of the small downsid surpris that we had in final sale   person consumpt came in at   percent versus the     percent we were es   and equip and softwar expenditur came in at     percent versus the     percent that we were es    one other area that came in a bit below our expect was net export  which is down there in the    level    area   nathan tell me that his folk would not be inclin to take all of the lower es   so they would probabl be carri a slight higher number for net export go forward     the materi use by mr    are append to this transcript  appendix     we had two small offset upward revis   one that was big in percentag chang differ was nonresidenti structur  for which the bea is es       percent versus     percent   that miss was princip in drill and mine  which would have been a big surpris to us in the second quarter   the bea has some proprietari inform on drill and mine   i must say the big increas that they are show for the past two quarter seem at odd with what we can see in the data that we look at for rig in use and foot drill   nevertheless  there is not realli ani strong reason to doubt that   go to the veri bottom part of the tabl  you can see for core pce an upsid surpris of     percentag point   that was all in the nonmarket compon of pce price  the part in which the bea is make various imput   in fact  the market part of the core pce came in     percentag point below our expect   again  we don   t typic give a great deal of weight to nonmarket price  so that is the gdp releas   i would say  obvious  it was stronger   i don   t see ani reason necessarili to doubt this number   it will be revis as data come in   in look at their es  for septemb  for which they are miss data  we could quibbl a bit on net export and on inventori   those quibbl would be larg offset  so if we had had this releas in hand  today we would probabl be show a number someth close to     percent  we had two other import piec of inform this morn   one was the adp survey of privat payrol employ growth   their es  for the gain in privat payrol in octob is           that is abov the        that we implicit had built into our forecast  again  this has signific inform content in term of it predict content for payrol  they have improv their methodolog over the past coupl of year as they have gotten into this  while i don   t think we would move our es  all the way to their          we would certain rais it from the        that we have   probabl to        or         at least  for an es  of payrol employ growth in octob  the other piec of data that came out this morn was the employ cost index   it is show hour compens for privat sector worker up at an annual rate of     percent in the third quarter   that is consider below our es  of     percent through the third quarter and leav the twelv month chang in that measur of hour compens flat at     percent  so that basic is show no sign of ani acceler whatsoev  obvious  a lot of detail will come out later today and tomorrow in term of the under data and assumpt behind this gdp releas   so right now i am realli shoot from the hip  but i will shoot away anyway   as i indic  i don   t think we would necessarili fight the bea on the     percent   we would probabl mark down our fourth quarter es  from the     percent that we had in the  book to     percent  with a smaller contribut come from inventori invest   again  we would probabl rais our level of inventori invest a bit but not enough to prevent the swing from becom a littl more negat go into the fourth quarter   that chang  if we were at     in the third quarter and     percent in the fourth quarter  would boost the second half from     in the  book to about     and rais the year as a whole from     to       on pce price  i don   t think we would realli do anyth to our forecast   we would take the third quarter es  on board  but we would keep the growth rate of both total pce price and core pce price unchang in the fourth quarter   so we would be ad somewher between     to the second half and      to the year as a whole   that might caus the year as a whole to round up just a bit  i think that is basic where we would be   in go back to my remark of ye day  i think that these releas   certain the gdp releas   would not have affect in ani import way our basic take on the data  which was that the incom data have been stronger than we had expect at the  e of the last meet   but we still see good reason for think that gdp growth will slow signific go forward   if we do get         on payrol employ for octob as in the adp data  the extent of that slow will probabl be a littl less than we thought in term of the overal level of gdp go forward   in term of the downsid risk  i think we are still look at a hous sector that has a signific amount of overhang and downsid risk and that could be a bit wors than we   re expect  shift gear complet   vice chairman   ask ye day about debt growth in our forecast and how it compar with the earli     s and the earlier part of this decad   i have left a chart of that at your place   as you can see  our forecast has a bigger drop off in debt growth than we have experienc so far in this decad but not near so larg as the one that we experienc in the late     s and the begin of the     s   again  i would character this forecast as not realli have what you would call a full blown credit crunch but as have some signific restrict on credit provis go forward   so i will take whatev question you might have  and i will do my best to answer them
ani question for dave   presid
mr  chairman  i just want to ask   and this is a question base on ignor   you   ve talk about nonresidenti structur  and you mention drill and mine   one thing that has impress me in talk to some of the bigger logist compani   fluor  bechtel  zachri   are the enorm number in what i mention earlier   the infrastructur develop in the gulf coast area and somewhat in the heartland  i think all the way up to presid hoenig   s district   the number are quit larg  and they continu to surg  would that be part of this nonresidenti structur invest number
yes  most of that would be part of this nonresidenti structur figur   but sinc we don   t know exact what proprietari inform the bea has  i   m not quit sure what is includ in the number   but conceptu  that should be there
and the weight of construct and mine is what
drill and mine in the overal economi is veri small
yes  that   s what i thought
i mean  nonresidenti structur contribut about     percent  drill and mine i could get for you
i think the two combin are someth like that
yes  it   s a small piec
other question for dave   presid
i had a follow up question on nonresidenti structur   you talk about drill and mine  and i was wonder about the other part of commerci real estat  was anyth in there   i don   t know if you had a chanc to look at it  but the reason i ask is that  if you thought financ was start to becom a problem and you do have veri weak nonresidenti invest go forward  you would expect to start see it there   so i   m wonder if anyth was in that breakout  i have a second question  which is that you didn   t mention durabl good   but if i thought that credit problem  particular subprim and other thing  were start to creat issu  i would expect to start see more imprint in the data for some of the durabl good   so was see durabl good a littl stronger in the consumpt figur a surpris at all
we don   t have the detail yet   in fact  a construct put in place releas will come out later today and will provid us with a bit more insight into the composit of the non drill and mine compon   so i don   t realli know what is happen there in term of this particular figur   in term of durabl good  given what we   ve seen  i think that it would still be earli at this point for ani credit restrict to have left much of an imprint on capit spend or durabl good order   we are look for that   we have been a littl surpris at the strength there  so i think that would be part of a question mark in our own mind as to whether we have overes  the restraint   but as i said ye day  given the data that we current have in hand  i think it is probabl too earli to see a signific mark yet from the credit restraint   if we don   t over the next three or four month  that will more serious call into question our forecast   now  we have not built in a veri larg capit spend effect from the financi turmoil becaus we basic think corpor financ is still look pretti good   there may be some pocket of stress and some difficulti with tighter term and standard in bank lend  but that is not the big area in which we are expect constraint   it realli is the household sector
mr  chairman  i would just like to take this opportun to remind the committe that you will have the opportun to revis your project that you submit a few day ago in light of the inform avail through the  e of this meet   of cours includ the data that were releas this morn   we would need to get your revis project by close of busi tomorrow
thank you   other question   if not
thank you  mr  chairman   i will be refer to the packag label    materi for fomc brief on monetari polici altern      that packag includ two version of tabl     the first is the version that was discuss in the bluebook  and the second is a revis version date octob      the revis tabl present basic the same polici altern as the bluebook version but with some chang in the rational and risk assess section   to review  altern b and c contempl leav the stanc of polici unchang today  but they differ import in their assess of risk   altern c character the downsid risk to growth as rough offset the upsid risk to inflat  wherea altern b indic that the downsid risk to growth are the committe   s greater polici concern   altern a  in contrast  eas the stanc of monetari polici    basi point and indic that the committe assess the risk to growth and inflat as rough in balanc   in discuss these altern  i will basic be work from right to left across the two version of the tabl   as dave   discuss ye day in respons to a question from vice chairman    the  book project is a modal forecast   without consider of risk  the  book analysi would seem to support the committe   s select of altern c   in that forecast  which is condit on the feder fund rate remain at    percent  econom growth slow in the near term  and below trend growth over the next few quarter close the small posit output gap that the staff see as current prevail   maintain the present stanc of monetari polici lead to a gradual strengthen of the expans over      and      and by enough to leav the economi produc at it capac   core inflat stay under   percent  while total inflat run a bit lower  reflect declin energi price   judg by your project  most of you would find such a trajectori for inflat satisfactori  at least for the next coupl of year if not over the longer term   your project submiss  howev  as well as your comment ye day  suggest that mani of you see less vigor in aggreg demand than the  book   as well as appreci downsid risk   an outlook that might argu against altern c   the  book provid sever altern simul involv greater weak in hous and larger fallout from financi stress that illustr some promin risk to spend  they suggest that the path of the feder fund rate might need to run   percentag point or more below baselin should such weak in aggreg demand eventu   the choic of altern b could be consist with a modal expect along the line of the  book coupl with appreci concern about downsid risk and a judgment that you need to await addit inform befor decid whether to eas polici further   as note in altern b  section    of either version  the statement would in effect explain the decis to stand pat  first  by recogn that econom growth last quarter was solid and perhap convey the implicit suggest that the economi was like to continu to expand at an accept pace  even if growth were to slow temporarili  second  by note that strain in financi market have eas somewhat on balanc  and third  by indic that the domest    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix     economi apart from hous has proven resili and that the global economi remain strong   at the same  e  the statement would indic that the committe is concern about downsid risk to growth  explicit cite the potenti effect of tighten credit condit   regard inflat  the languag would be ident to that use in septemb   the statement would conclud by indic that  on balanc  the committe saw the downsid risk to growth as the greater polici concern   as bill   note  the market was all but certain as of ye day that you will eas polici today    basi point   today  in respons to the econom data releas earlier  intermedi and longer term interest rate have risen somewhat  howev  futur quot still suggest that investor now see high odd that you will eas polici today   thus  the announc of an unchang stanc of polici would come as a consider surpris to market   to be sure  the assess under altern b that the downsid risk are the greater polici concern and it implic that further eas might well be forthcom befor long would soften the blow   but a selloff in bond and equiti market would no doubt ensu   moreov  financi asset price could remain volatil for a  e  as investor attempt to recalibr their expect of the probabl path of monetari polici go forward   concern about such market reaction clear would not persuad you to eas polici at this meet if you judg that an unchang stanc of polici would like be more consist with maximum employ and stabl price  and hitch monetari polici to market expect would make for extrem poor econom outcom   but especi in circumst of persist financi strain  concern about unnecessarili ad to those strain might inclin you a bit more toward eas  as in altern a  if you were alreadi strong lean that way today base on your view of econom and financi fundament   as i note ye day  your econom project suggest that most of you believ that the stanc of polici should be eas within the next six to twelv month  and mani of you indic that some eas was appropri immin   you may see sever reason for prefer to move earlier rather than later   in particular  you may think that a  e reduct in interest rate could be valuabl now in buoy household  busi  and investor confid   ye day the chairman note the possibl of a vicious cycl involv a deterior macroeconom outlook and tighten credit condit  by bol  confid in the outlook  eas polici as expect could help reduc concern about deterior econom fundament and declin asset valu  beyond reduc the risk of nonlinear respons  eas polici as expect by market particip would support growth of aggreg demand over  e through the usual channel   of cours  you may also be worri about a possibl increas in inflat   such concern may reflect a varieti of factor   the further sharp increas in oil price of recent week  the depreci of the dollar  acceler unit labor cost  and perhap the relat high level of resourc util   but given the recent good inflat perform  you may feel that downsid risk to growth are the more immedi danger and believ that further eas today to address those risk is warrant   you may also believ that  should the eas eventu appear to have been unnecessari  you could act as quick to remov s ulus as you did to put it in place   if you were inclin toward eas polici anoth    basi point at this meet  you would need to confront the question of the appropri statement languag   in both version of altern a  the first two sentenc of section   are similar to those propos for altern b   but rather than emphas remain downsid risk  the statement would then repeat most of the    help forestal    languag use in septemb   the languag propos for the inflat paragraph in both version is ident to the correspond paragraph suggest for altern b  again  the languag shown in the octob    version suggest a bit more concern about inflat risk than the septemb languag   final  both version of altern a would character the upsid risk to inflat as rough balanc the downsid risk to growth   this indic might well lead market particip to reduc the near two third odd that they current place on anoth quarter point eas in decemb and might trim the extent of the overal eas of polici anticip over the next year or so   thus  implement of altern a also could prompt some further backup in market interest rate   in close  let me remind the committe that the septemb trial run highlight the potenti for inconsist between the result of the project survey and the committe   s statement   your latest forecast submiss indic that  while a minor of you see the risk to inflat as skew to the upsid  a slight major perceiv the risk to total inflat as broad balanc  and a more sizabl major judg that the risk to core inflat are in balanc   these result could be seen as incongru with the draft statement for some of the altern   for exampl  altern a refer upsid risk to inflat   sever consider might explain this appar inconsist   for exampl  your respons on skew in the project survey may captur onli the subject probabl that you attach to various outcom  while you may see the statement languag as captur not onli the odd but also the econom cost associ with those outcom   or perhap the upsid risk to inflat referenc in the statement should be interpret as reflect the view of all member not just of the major who saw inflat risk as balanc  thus encompass the view of those in the minor who see upsid inflat risk  final  i am worri about the possibl that some of you may have provid your numer project under the assumpt of appropri monetari polici but may not have appli that assumpt as well to your individu risk assess   in your upcom remark  you may wish to address whether there is ani tension between your own view of the distribut of risk and the risk assess in the draft statement   thank you
do i have it correct that the blue show the chang between the bluebook and the current version
so the onli chang from the bluebook in a   and c   are that there   s a more expans descript of the inflat risk  and in a   there is simpli the phrase    after this action      those are the onli chang from the bluebook   are there ani question for     presid
we don   t have a long histori of announc the risk assess contemporan with the decis  so i   m curious as to your take on the like respons   in altern b  section    it say that the committe view the downsid risk to econom growth as the greater polici concern  and i think you said that market would like see a fund rate declin as forthcom   what has been our experi when we have invok this type of risk and what has the actual polici been afterward
i   m not sure i could answer that without do a fair amount of research  presid     my sens is that  as i think i indic in my remark  for the polici decis today there is effect    basi point or so of eas still built in   so there would be a consider surpris in that dimens   accord to a chart that i am look at  the biggest upsid surpris in the feder fund rate that we have experienc sinc the era of polici announc began in      has been more on the order of    basi point   so that dimens of altern b would  i think  be pretti signific   i don   t realli know how much the assess of risk might moder the shock   i think there would be some moder effect there  but it would be limit
so as i thought about this briefli  it seem to me as though it   s not unusu for us to say that  becaus of the risk of higher inflat  we don   t feel we   d take action in subsequ meet for quit some  e   but when we have had this type of assess   i think there have been onli a coupl of opportun   usual we   ve had a declin pretti quick thereaft
i think the market take the upsid risk to inflat as more what central banker have to say
right  and i think that the downsid risk would be view as more a hint of the way that the central bank is lean   so i don   t think they are symmetr
i just want to ask you for a littl more detail about the market   s reaction to the gdp number and the adp data   you said that it   s the same   can you be just a littl more precis   is there ani movement at all in term of the assess of the feder fund rate cut at this meet
a veri small one  i think
about how much
novemb fed fund futur were up   basi point  decemb was up   basi point  januari fed fund were up   basi point  and then as you go further out they are   to     so it   s fair small
breakeven were up about   basi point across the curv
i have two question   one just came to mind   we are talk about veri recent futur expect   in light of what you just discuss  what has been the rang in the intermeet period in term of the odd of a    basi point cut
i think it has been as low as    and as high as   it   s nest  becaus there is some probabl on    and some probabl on      but if you look at the cleveland fed  i think it has rang from about    to about
so it has been all over the lot   my question realli is mayb not so much of   but just to inform a decis here  or at least to inform an input   there was some discuss ye day of strong hint about the need to have insur   that is  insur against the risk of downsid econom growth that might be more dramat than we would like   we did cut rate    basi point at the last meet      when do you assum that kick in   other than the psycholog effect   i infer from the number in the  book that you see it begin to have an effect on the kind of econom growth we were suppos some  in the second half or at the end of the second quarter of next year   or what is the lag   we have alreadi bought an insur polici   the question is  is it enough   so i   m curious as to what your assumpt is as to when that actual take grip in the economi
it start immedi   small   the mean lag is about four quarter  so you get about half of the effect in the first year and the other half of the effect in the second year  and that  at least accord to the model  feed in relat smooth over that period
did it bump up your es  for the second half of next year in term of econom growth from where it would have been had we not cut rate    basi point
are there ani other question   presid
just a follow up on your comment about think about the releas and of uncertainti and risk around inflat and unemploy   it look as though the nomenclatur that we   ve use in the assess of risk was in part intend to get at the direct of polici in the futur   it   seem a littl awkward if the languag that we   re use in the assess of risk look differ from these fair stark histogram   sinc we haven   t gone through this experi befor  see histogram that aren   t consist with our statement seem like an awkward start
well  one point to make is that the histogram aren   t in the public releas   they won   t see those data per se
they will be   the histogram will be publish   yes
not the asymmetri of the risk  but it will be describ
i think this emphas the import of the point that   made about the opportun everybodi has to revisit their submiss  particular in term of how they think about the risk to the forecast in the wake of a possibl move in monetari polici   we haven   t talk about this in much detail befor  but if the expect path of monetari polici in the near term chang between when you submit and when we clarifi  then that might chang a bit and  i would think  would affect what those histogram might look like in term of the balanc   it won   t affect them dramat  but it will affect them a littl   i   m not sure it will make them converg fulli to the way altern a  section    is written now
just to follow up on that   we submit this last friday  right   i don   t know if peopl will know when we submit it  but it   s not a huge amount of  e between when it was submit and when we are make an announc   so if there were a larger span of  e  i would think that awkward wouldn   t be as great
i think your point about the awkward is right
i have a process question   in this go round  are we go to talk just about the polici decis in the statement  or are we suppos to includ the discuss of the project
it   s a separ agenda item
so it will be a separ discuss   that   s what i thought   okay
yes   are there ani other question for     if not  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   while the intermeet period has seen a mix of good news and bad news  a substanti amount of good news  the net effect on my near term outlook  as i said ye day  has been negat  stem larg from the continu slide in hous   i have come around to the view that the slump in hous activ is go to be deeper and more prolong than i had thought   mani of you have read the intermeet news as posit on the outlook   my sens of my shift in view is that i have come closer to the median view of my colleagu around the tabl about the second half outlook   take all of this on board  my assess would be that  even given the    basi point reduct in the fed fund rate at the septemb meet  the current fund rate is probabl somewhat more restrict than is desir   so i would favor a    basi point reduct in the fed fund rate at this meet  along with a statement that contain no tilt  as in altern a  and i endors the passag in blue that highlight the inflat risk  let me first comment on market expect   you know  they have to influenc our decis  but we need to be care about that  obvious   i don   t think we should ever be afraid of disappoint expect or put a new outlier in     s chart   at the same  e  those expect are a fact  and we have to take into account the like effect of our action on market   as i think governor kohn said ye day  they do contain within them some market assess  some inform  that we can   t ignor or that we ignor at our peril   so that had some influenc on my decis as well   i   m think that there may be a need for an increas some  next year if the economi strengthen more than in the staff forecast   in addit  i have not lost sight of the risk of inflat increas   in particular  i   d take this opportun to endors the public statement of governor kohn that an increas in inflat would not be in the public interest    laughter
i stand by that
that would be intrepid of you
well  i   m hope that inflat drift down enough so that pessimist about adjust cost will swing around to endors a lower numer object for inflat  if we see sign of firm inflat or firm growth earli next year  i would hope for a firmer polici stanc accompani by appropri communic   so my prefer today is a compon of a prefer polici rule that has us respond with alacr should thing firm next year   that conclud my statement  mr  chairman
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll take just a second here becaus i realiz how difficult today   s decis is and that it involv balanc contrast and rather elev risk   one risk is that the current hous and financi environ will cascad the real economi immedi into a slowdown  and that would cost output and job and prove after all to involv littl effect on rise inflat   to do noth in this instanc  i realiz  would at least seem to be a poor choic  the other risk  howev  is that inflat is less contain than we would like to think  aggreg demand is at least hold and look firm   commod price  not just energi  show a rise trend and are unusu high   the dollar has depreci  as   point out  and if it continu to fall  will add to further inflationari pressur   unit labor cost are increas  and these inflationari factor are real and show themselv to be present in tip measur and in term of expect inflat  as i mention ye day  in a lot of anecdot discuss that i have had   to eas further in this instanc would also seem to be a poor choic  i realiz that the intens of these two countervail forc complic our decis  and i know that i might be onli one view on this  among other who have a differ view   but as i see it  we are have to choos a polici that involv tradeoff around these two choic  one choic is to eas now   we would take an action that is orient toward the short run  and the immedi eas could be look at as an insur polici  as i have heard it describ  design to mitig further the possibl that the current upheav in the hous and financi market will lead to an unwant slowdown in the real economi   if the economi strengthen  as presid   has point out  we can alway revers that eas   so we tell ourselv   the other choic is to hold firm now   inflationari risk  as i   ve describ abov  are real  and while they are unlik to affect us in the short run  they most certain could affect us in the longer run if we continu to eas   if inflat abov accept level get entrench into the u s  and global economi  make no mistak   as we all have experienc  this has happen befor  inflat   creep in   it  sn   t jump in   it   s a littl at a  e   also  if we eas today and thing don   t turn immedi  we will be reset for anoth discuss of what the market expect when we come to decemb   the cost to remedi inflationari momentum later is also high   inde  as we all know  so what is the better choic  then  when adjust for long run and short run consider regard these elev risk   person  i think that we should hold where we are   when i analyz how the u s  and global economi are perform and look at the project for these economi that we share here  i judg this to be the better long run decis   we move rate down signific at our last meet   inde  we front load the action to ensur a strong result   also  we are veri close to neutral  if not there  i realiz  and we need to be slight firm if we are to hold inflat and inflationari expect better in check  it strike me that inflat is at the higher end of what most individu prefer   if we need to move down  we can do so later   it is  in fact  easier to lower rate than to rais them back up  our issu today  i think  remain for the moment princip liquid  and we should remind the world that we have step up to this issu and reassur it that we are readi to meet the need further   and other need  if necessari   but for now the risk on both side of this polici decis are elev  and we need to wait  watch  and be readi to act depend on how event play out  as to the statement  then  i prefer altern b for the most part   i would prefer someth along the line in paragraph   that    financi market remain uncertain     and then    thus the committe will continu          or paragraph   in altern c   thank you veri much  mr  chairman
i   m sorri   you prefer c   to b    is that what you said
includ the balanc risk
well  what i realli prefer is that we go back to our last statement but say     financi market obvious remain uncertain  and we will watch them   thus           and then bring in    the committe will continu to assess the effect of financi and other factor     without the downsid risk
so that is basic the septemb assess
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with presid hoenig that this is a difficult decis between stay where we are   and i would have downsid risk to growth on that   or move     but with more balanc risk   i think it   s difficult   we are balanc a number of veri difficult thing here   on the one hand  the incom data  as dave has emphas  have been  if anyth  stronger than we anticip on the real economi and includ data for septemb and some hint for octob in here   on the other hand  mani member of the committe  myself includ  have a sens that the real interest rate is still a littl to the high side of where it need to be to promot full employ and stabl price over  e  we expect the output gap to move over the next coupl of quarter  as hous hold down growth relat to potenti   we expect inflat to stay low and inflat expect  if anyth  perhap to edg down as peopl realiz that inflat is go to stay at   or below   i wonder whether the    basi point we did last  e was enough to offset the tighter credit condit that have develop and the market disrupt that are go to imped  particular  the secondari market for nonconform mortgag for some  e   this stuff isn   t go to go away soon  and it   s go to weigh on demand  part as a result of this sens  mani of us think that the risk to growth are on the downsid but are still worri about inflat expect   the risk to growth on the downsid are compound  as the chairman and   point out  by the sens that financi market are still fragil and there is the tail risk of get into the feedback spiral between concern about the real economi and reaction in financi market   not the most like outcom  but certain a tail risk  as i tri to squar sever circl at the same  e  i came down on altern a  reduc    basi point but go to risk be rough balanc   i see this as preemptiv but not open end   i think that combin of preempt some of the tail risk  get a littl ahead of the possibl  and buy this insur is help   but go to rough balanc risk take out the open end sens that we   re on a path toward ever lower interest rate   i see the incom data for inflat as consist with this   inflat has been low even with today   s data   i think the core pce has been low  the cpi is up a littl but not much   i found the eci data kind of interest this morn   i have been a littl concern about labor cost creep up  which you could see from some of the compens data   but the eci is a good  consist measur over  e   it is not total comprehens   also  the fact that there is no increas in the growth rate of the eci to me is pretti encourag that under cost pressur are not build   by emphas our concern about inflat   that the risk are rough balanc   we are signal that we are not buy into the full extent of the market expect for our eas  and i think that is a good thing   the    rough balanc    languag will rais the hurdl a bit for ourselv to eas again in decemb if we have some weak data  but it won   t rais it so high that  if the data are realli weak  we can   t react in a construct way to chang it  so put all of this togeth and admit that it is a close call  i think that altern a   rough balanc risk   minim the deviat from where we want to be  help us send the signal about what we think might be come and what our concern are  and come closest to further econom perform toward our object   i certain agre with presid   that alacr will be requir   i think i actual call it    nimbl    in the speech i gave   i want to quot myself again   and that will be veri much in the forefront as we go forward next year  i agre   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   one of my life long purpos has been to make the world safe for ambival and indecis    laughter
how is that go
well  i   m gain ground this morn    laughter   have said that  i prefer that we reduc the feder fund rate target    basi point   my thought process is that the soften of econom activ  at least in some sector  and the lower es  suggest that the neutral rate of interest may be fall   the downsid risk to econom growth and the evid of linger liquid issu are to me good argument for take step that insur against an inadvert restrict polici stanc  with regard to the polici statement  i am go to continu to use the inexperi excus as long as i can  even though we have some newer member   but just a few remark  the languag in the rational section of altern a most close reflect my assess of the situat  but i am not entir comfort with ani of the option for the assess of risk  the real econom outlook face uncertainti on the downsid that are difficult to character  becaus of that  i am skeptic that we can credibl claim near term downsid growth risk to be rough in balanc with upsid inflat risk  as is done in altern a and c   that said  i worri that the word in altern b would be interpret as a rather signific loss of confid in the economi and a signal that anoth rate reduct is probabl in the near term  at this point  i   d prefer not to send a signal that anoth rate cut is most like in decemb  sinc our last meet  expect were center on no chang in the fed fund target today until a string of weak hous and earn report move the probabl strong in the direct of a rate reduct   thus  judg from the evolut of market expect sinc our septemb meet  the assess of risk languag in our last statement was suffici to convinc financi market particip that our decis on the fund rate is be driven by incom data   as i said  i think the assess of risk statement should tri to recogn the uncertainti inher in our growth forecast   and those uncertainti are greater than those associ with our inflat forecast   but without tilt expect in favor of a futur rate cut   as i said in my remark ye day  it is quit possibl that we will enter anoth period in which headlin inflat number exceed the trend suggest by core measur   if that is even a short live problem  my opinion is that   and this is base on the bluebook version   we would be well serv to note that fact by adopt the languag in altern c  section     howev  i do note that the new languag  as present this morn  in altern a  section    is quit help becaus it larg incorpor the languag in altern c   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pool
mr  chairman  thank you   two week ago i was pretti adam in my own mind that the recommend i would be offer was no chang  but i have reluct tilt in the other direct and favor a    basi point cut   i have chang my mind becaus of realli two thing   first  in my discuss with our director  in my phone call befor the meet  and around the tabl ye day  i think there has been fair pervas anecdot inform indic a soft economi   not disastr weak but just soft  certain softer than the hard data that have been come in   second  the financi market are still unsettl  and with the market put a veri high probabl on action  i am concern about the effect of violat that market expect   i ask myself how big a risk it would be to violat the market expect  and i am not realli sure   but i am not sure that i want to find out either   it is just not a risk that i realli want to run  that said  it is veri import that we understand   i think everybodi    but i want to state it   that there can be no equilibrium in the economi if all we ever do is follow the market expect   we have to get out front  and we have to help defin what that market expect is go to be   i think there are a number of thing that we could do come up to the decemb meet not onli in the statement but also in speech and comment that we make   i favor the altern a languag for the most part  but i am a littl concern about the assess of risk statement   if it is realli true that upsid risk to inflat is mantra  then what is oper in the statement is downsid risk to growth in term of shape market expect about the committe   s direct in the futur  as i tri to think through the downsid risk to growth in the come week or the next few month  we can   t realli do anyth about what is go to happen in the remaind of the fourth quarter or the first part of next year   but when i think about the period over which the polici action make a differ  i am not sure that the risk are realli skew to the downsid  we could well see the recoveri of normal market process proceed  plus the lower interest rate  give more or less equal probabl in the second  third  or fourth quarter of next year of a    basi point upsid surpris or a    basi point downsid surpris in the growth rate of gdp  so i would like to see us work on the languag for paragraph     given that paragraph   includ risk to inflat  we might concentr just on the growth risk  and we might say someth like     after this polici action  the upsid and downsid risk to econom growth in come quarter are rough balanc      becaus i think this will be the thing that the market key off of in term of a hint about our futur polici or like polici direct   i would like to see us go as far as we can in the direct of say that we think we   ve done enough  at least for the  e be   let   s sit  wait  and see what happen  provid that the inform come in more or less as expect and we don   t have ani big surpris on that  look further ahead  we are at a point where we are realli within reach of bring the inflat rate down to about     percent on a long run basi   we   re also at a point that  in come meet  we could throw that option away   if we go too far or hang on with lower rate too long  then we   re go to end up eighteen month from now look at a situat in which we have rekindl some inflat pressur   so this is a critic  e in term of not go too far and also of be will to take back some of these cut   i guess the way i look at it is that  if    percent was the appropri fund rate in juli or june  befor the financi distress realli took hold  it probabl can   t be too far off where we want to be onc the financi turmoil is larg over   we are go to end up substanti below that if we cut    basi point today   so i think it   s import that we not go too far and that we tri to set market expect that we have this much longer run view and that we   re not just react to the veri short run data on the real economi   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the last  e we sat around this tabl  i and mani of you argu for what the market describ as a surpris aggress    basi point rate cut   at that  e  the baselin  book forecast was for    basi point     in subsequ meet  and then flat thereaft   our rational was that we were tri to act preemptiv  tri to get ahead of the curv  to limit some of the potenti spillov effect from what we then believ to be a weaken hous market  perhap a somewhat softer labor market  and the financi turmoil   we also argu that higher than normal tail risk loom out there  that it was associ with the financi market meltdown  and that it warrant aggress action to help forestal the possibl of that   in the forecast that we submit in septemb  and we all submit a forecast  the appropri polici vari   nine of us submit appropri polici as be consist with the  book  which was         and then constant   of the remain eight  seven of us had a    basi point cut in septemb  which we did   mani of those  includ myself  had some further cut to the fund rate but further out in the economi  more like in        later in        and        as we move toward more stabl inflat  expect come down  a recov economi  and so forth   i was certain in that camp as well  and in fact  most peopl end up with a fund rate forecast at either    or     percent   littl differ but not much   in septemb  onli two of us anticip appropri polici as drop    basi point befor the end of        of cours  we all have the luxuri  fortun  of chang our mind in respons to data and other thing  and certain all of us are do our best to read the tea leav of the economi  both aggreg and within our region  and that influenc the color and textur that we put around our forecast   we all work veri hard at that  and i respect those effort   but i think it is import that  as a committe  we enforc disciplin and systemat behavior on ourselv as our view evolv  particular as those view influenc polici choic   without that disciplin  without that systemat behavior  i find it veri difficult to figur out how i am go to communic to the public about what monetari polici is do and whi   it make both our commit and our credibl  either to inflat or to employ growth  more difficult to substanti   it make transpar in general more difficult   all of those thing   commit  credibl  and transpar   are import element of what contribut to a stabl econom environ   now i have tri to impos that disciplin about polici on myself by focus on the incom data  tri to focus on how those data caus me to revis my outlook for the real economi  not for tomorrow or next month particular but for the come quarter   after all  the monetari polici we have just been talk about oper with somewhat of a lag   in that sens  i think there has been a lot of discuss by myself and other around the tabl that we are data driven  that we are forecast base in how we think about our polici choic  and that we tri to take a somewhat longer run view   i think that view is import to communic to the public  i suspect that at the end of our last meet   certain i can speak for myself   mani  if not most  of us probabl would not have anticip that we would cut again at this meet  perhap some of you did   certain  your appropri polici path in our forecast at the last meet didn   t suggest that   but we wouldn   t have anticip cut unless we thought that the outlook for the economi had notic deterior   so what has realli happen sinc the last meet   well  the collect forecast that we submit   in term of risk assess  rang  median  and howev you want to look at them   hard budg   the  book forecast didn   t chang veri much   the economi general had better than expect news on mani front   not huge better but certain the surpris were on averag to the upsid for most of us given our forecast from last  e   i thought we general agre that the risk of serious financi meltdown  while perhap it hadn   t vanish  had mitig at least somewhat   as a consequ  neither the  book nor our collect fomc forecast move veri much   to the extent that they did  they actual move up a littl  base on that forecast and on the data that came in  i   m in a veri troubl posit in figur out how to justifi in my mind addit rate cut at this meet   had this meet been held two week ago  as presid pool suggest  befor the market   s reaction to the write down in some of the financi institut  befor the fair dramat flip flop in the fed fund rate futur market about the assess of a futur rate cut  i certain would not have been in favor of a rate cut at that  e  and i suggest that each of you should ask yourself the question that bill did   would i have chosen to cut rate at that  e   i certain would have also resist the temptat  aris from those data and what has happen over the past two week  to be in ani great rush to think we need to call a special meet of the fomc to consid addit rate cut   my attitud would have been that these financi market are volatil and they are bounc around an aw lot  we understand that there are risk  but let   s wait and get the data on the real economi and see how it is evolv and make appropri decis at the  e  what worri me is that we run the risk of be whipsaw here by market expect or by the financi market that are move around in a veri volatil way   that leav me with some concern that we may be put ourselv in a posit of either respond too much to these volatil market or be accus by market of be bulli by the financi market  so at this point  my take is to say that we are go to get a lot of data between now and decemb   we are go to get two more employ report  as we have discuss   we are go to get some more inform about retail sale and consumpt   i would prefer to keep my own approach to disciplin base policymak by look at the forecast and wait for the data to tell me whether my forecast deterior signific   if it has  i will be the first to argu for an addit rate cut in decemb if i think it is call for  right now we have a difficult  e justifi a decis   on what ground are we go to justifi it  particular in a more systemat fashion   i think that creat problem for us   as we have alreadi been discuss  it is creat somewhat of a problem in the languag of the statement  and i will come back to that in a minut   but i also think that  without a veri articul rational in the data and in reason that support a systemat approach to polici  we run the risk of be caprici or arbitrari   i think we are in a situat  as kevin   said ye day and tom hoenig spoke about  when mani of us view inflat risk as more fragil perhap than they have been recent  particular more fragil in an environ in which we are cut rate   i think that we run the risk  more so now perhap than in other  e  that inflat expect might be at risk   i don   t want to rais those inflat expect   they are much harder to get down   you can   t act nimbl to deal with movement in expect inflat  i also think we have to ask ourselv the question   and this tie into the balanc of risk issu   if we choos to cut today when our forecast hasn   t declin and suppos the data between now and decemb look as they have for the past six week   kind of in line with what we expect  not much differ one way or anoth with noth realli fall out of bed or boom   on what basi in that meet would we choos or not choos to cut again   at this meet we have had a hard  e grappl with the criteria that we are use   if we are not veri explicit about those criteria  we could find ourselv in the same boat next  e   i think this is relat to tom   s point that  onc we start on the path of make explicit what our expect are or what the market is go to be expect us to do without have a firm basi for say we are do this becaus of x or y  we are go to find ourselv in an awkward posit in decemb  so i share     s concern about the assess of risk languag in altern a be balanc when it seem to be out of touch with the way the committe has describ thing  again  i think that put us in an awkward posit of tri to balanc those two thing   so with that  i appreci the  e  mr  chairman   on net  i am troubl by a cut today   i would much prefer to wait until decemb and to assess the data that come in   if a    basi point cut in decemb is requir  so be it  but i feel as though we would have a firmer basi then for make that decis   thank you
mr  chairman
yes  vice chairman
let the record show i am ask this with a smile  presid    you are not realli suggest that your colleagu  if they have evolv in their view  are undisciplin  unsystemat  or caprici in their rational for that evolut  are you
no  i am just say that the communic of that rational is t i  and i did say that peopl are make their best effort to make their forecast   i explain my view of how i disciplin my forecast and how i disciplin my policymak
just to clarifi about the submiss you present   you have  as i think you said ye day  a    basi point cut earli in the year  in the first quarter
first quarter perhap  but that was condit on inflat and inflationari expect remain well behav
thank you  mr  chairman   i found the choic between altern a and b to be a tough call   i   ve struggl with this over the past week  and in the end i find the argument for altern a for a    basi point rate cut more persuas   i have sever reason for this judgment  first  as i argu ye day  further action to my mind is appropri  even leav asid the recent financi shock   with output near potenti and inflat near my object  the stanc of polici should be close to neutral  and while we can debat exact what the equilibrium real interest rate is   that   s an import discuss to me   it appear that  even after our action in septemb  polici is somewhat restrict   i agre with presid     s view that we need to maintain some consist in our think over  e  and i would say that i express this ident view at our last meet and said at that  e that i did envis a    basi point cut dure        so my view haven   t chang  and the data that we have seen in the intermeet period haven   t sudden push me in the direct of this move   instead  if anyth  slight away from it  but i regard those data as larg uninform   so my view realli haven   t chang about this  but it seem to me that the argument that we should be move toward neutral   allow for quit a bit of flexibl in the  e of an addit rate cut   it  sn   t have to be someth that we do in octob   we could do it in decemb  or it could wait until januari   so that argument in and of itself  sn   t complet persuad me that we have to do it today  but i do think it would be prudent to act today for a coupl of reason   the first has to do with the effect of the financi shock of the summer   when we came into the meet last month  we face credit condit that were quit restrict  and our goal was to offset that shock to avoid a signific econom slowdown   i think the favor inflat result over the previous six month did give us the flexibl to take strong action  which we did   my judgment is that we have had some success so far   financi condit appear to be easier than they were in septemb  and arguabl  as i said ye day  i think we may have rough neutral the shock   but an import element in our success has been the declin in treasuri rate along with the further declin we   ve seen in the dollar and the increas in equiti price sinc we last met   those chang are support by the market   s expect that we will eas further at this meet and beyond   in other word  if we don   t eas today as the market expect  then rate may move up  and that rais concern to my mind about whether we will have accomplish the goal of offset the restrict effect of the recent financi shock   a second reason for eas today is the asymmetr natur of the risk we face in achiev our goal   i do see some upsid risk to inflat although i have not read the recent increas in five to ten year inflat compens as realli reflect a market percept of a deterior in long term inflat expect   in my view  the more serious risk is the one that our chairman discuss ye day of unleash negat nonlinear dynam in the real and financi economi that could be difficult to revers   condit in hous market and their possibl implic for hous price and  in turn  consumpt are at the center of these concern   in addit  although liquid in financi market has improv  i think the market are still rather fragil and subject to further sudden disrupt  i   m comfort with the word in altern a  includ the balanc of risk assess  through the fed fund rate be    basi point lower  i do see the upsid risk to inflat as be rough balanc with the downsid risk to growth   i think the statement   give us suffici flexibl to respond in whatev way we need to  and that includ the possibl of take back some of this eas should there be upsid surpris   i do think that it   s import to signal to market that this is not yet anoth step in a plan seri of continu rate cut
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  find myself torn between altern a and altern b and have been anguish over them much of the last week figur out where i come out   the econom outcom detail in both boston   s and the board   s forecast with no chang in interest rate seem reason   the evid sinc the last meet indic that there may have been more strength in the real economi than we expect in the third quarter  and financi market have been recov  but they are certain not back to normal   the risk are clear on the downsid  and our forecast expect a weak fourth quarter   so certain an argument for altern b is to cut when it is clearer that the fourth quarter will be weak or we have data of more signific collater damag from the hous sector   the argument for altern a would seem to be that we should take out more insur against the downsid risk   the cost for such action are not great  and given the downsid risk  some addit insur is not unreason  howev  we have discuss the modal forecast at some length  but our rigor around the tail is quit limit  make it difficult to determin how often and how much insur should be taken out against downsid risk   thus  i prefer to wait until there are more data that the economi is weaken  which i think is like to happen  just to comment on the assess of risk   when i look at the uncertainti in term of gdp growth  i think of the histogram   that   s quit stark   if the major concern we have is downsid pressur on price of hous  which is my concern   that hous price continu to declin and hous get much wors   i think    basi point is probabl a small premium to pay   but i doubt that i would chang where i would put the weight even with a    basi point cut   i think the hous scenario that is detail in the  book will still be there whether or not we cut the    basi point  and my guess is that between now and decemb we   ll have more confirm that it is a concern  whatev we do in term of the languag  we need it to be consist and accur  and i am a littl worri about the languag in altern a be consist and accur with what we are go to portray in our uncertainti of risk if we show those histogram   so if we   re show the histogram  regardless of whether or not we have a    basi point cut  i think the altern b languag is more consist with at least what we put down   unless peopl think that  with the    basi point cut  there is a big shift in the uncertainti and the risk to gdp growth  i do worri about how that will play out in the market and what kind of a tension there will be
if the languag in altern a  section     the assess of risk   were simpli about the likelihood of rate chang in either direct and didn   t say anyth about growth and inflat  would you view that as inconsist with the assess in our project
no   if the goal is to tri to convey that we aren   t necessarili go to cut rate again  that is differ from an assess that there   s a downsid risk that hous will get much wors   so whatev we put in that should reflect what we actual want to convey and certain shouldn   t be inconsist with histogram that we   re go to be publish at the same  e
i ask this  mr  chairman  becaus i   ve said this befor on a coupl of occas   the awkward about the assess of risk statement is that it talk about rate but it talk about them use a code about growth and inflat rather than talk about the rate themselv
just for clarif   and     you can correct me   we are not go to publish the histogram show the risk   we will describ verbal  general speak  the committe   s view   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i find myself in agreement with so mani thing that have been said alreadi  no matter how the conflict may appear   this is a close call   i think it   s a tough decis   i have  frank  gone back and forth in think about the nuanc here   it is the case that the data have been better than i expect at the  e of our septemb meet   the adp report this morn sort of continu that   it didn   t have to work out that way  but         is a pretti strong number   i   m still tri to figur out exact how to project that to payrol employ   the bad news that we have seen in term of survey has hard been surpris  given our view and what we would have expect in septemb   so i found myself grappl with mani of the idea that presid   was talk about earlier in term of data depend and our decis and discuss in septemb   one view is that    basi point in septemb was seen as enough  and we would be judg our futur action on the basi of deterior in our forecast   data that come in wors than that or some inform about risk that are hard to quantifi but we thought would be import   i haven   t seen the impetus for that   so that   s one view   then the other view is the risk manag perspect   mayb mani peopl  presid   includ  thought that more than    was requir but onli    in septemb was realli achiev without startl market   so there   s a tension there  mr  chairman  i realli enjoy your speech in st  loui  when you talk about differ respons to differ type of uncertainti   with the sort of standard brainard respons  when the economi might be chang but we have a lot of uncertainti  we go slowli and we look at it  juxtapos against that are other type of risk  such as the financi risk  where thing could be move much more quick and we don   t fulli appreci the potenc of polici and what we can do against certain tail risk   in that case  the robust control type of approach suggest that we should do more  then in the event that we find that polici is veri effect  we can revers it   of cours  revers it is import   we talk about that last  e  too  it seem to me that we   re close to the limit of initi risk manag   that   s how i   ve thought about this  and i thought that governor kohn   s comment that we shouldn   t view this as an open end commit to risk manag was veri import   after all  how can you ever argu that more insur won   t help against some catastroph  some unforeseen tail risk that hasn   t yet happen   there is a lot of valu to set a benchmark stop point for how you would respond to that tail risk   then if other evid interven to make you reassess the likelihood of that tail risk or the cost of it  then there   s reason to do more   but i think there   s valu to put the benchmark out there   anoth way to stop this insur is if we end up balanc the risk   the action taken move our inflat risk up  and we   ve had some concern about that   i   m actual pretti comfort with the inflat risk  and peopl have remind me that i   m push this pretti far   i   ve taken more comfort from our abil to forecast inflat than perhap other would   it seem to have a pretti reason trajectori   but as we continu to move toward more accommod polici in the hope of address a tail risk  i think those risk go up  too  as i look at tabl   and i struggl with the rate decis  it seem to me that the balanc of risk was more import  and what got my attent earli on was the risk assess under altern a   i thought it was import to project our assess that risk were a littl more balanc   i can easili imagin that we   ll have reason to reduc the fed fund rate becaus we think that r  is lower  but it   s pure opportunist to take advantag of that now   we could have done that sever meet ago  but we can do it opportunist   so i   m okay with the action of    basi point today  and i think that the balanc risk assess is import   we probabl do need to think about the linkag with our project  i hadn   t realli taken full account of that myself   that will put me and  i hope  mani of us much closer to the view that presid   express in term of data depend becaus i think that the risk will be balanc in how the data continu to roll out in the intermeet period   so thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   i take the view that a cut today is justifi on the basi that keep rate where they current are leav us with a lot of downsid risk   that   s exact what i   ve been hear from other peopl   if there is  in fact  downsid risk  whi not move today   i would be veri troubl by not chang and still use the languag in altern b becaus it say there   s a lot of downsid risk   then there is the problem of whi we are sit there and not do anyth   on just the straight econom issu  i think that a cut could be justifi   in particular  i was one of the peopl who advoc a cut at this meet   in fact  i was be a bit   i don   t know what the right word is   flamboy when i suggest a cut of    basi point and then that we might move back up    basi point   i was tri to make the point that i was veri concern about the macroeconom risk  the potenti for a downward spiral of financi disrupt lead to problem in the real sector and then feed back on the financi market  and realli felt that we need to keep ahead of the curv  what is key is that the respons to our action on septemb    was almost textbook perfect in the sens that the market realli got the messag that we were not go to be asleep at the wheel  as a result  the macro risk was taken out of these market  and we achiev exact the kind of signal that we intend   so clear i do not feel that we need to get ahead of the curv in that sens  the way i did last  e   also veri import in my think about the macro issu is that i think inflat expect are contain   we have been abl to achiev that   in particular  there is a bit of concern about inflat compens have gone up in term of the spread between nomin rate and tip   but the analysi that i   ve heard from peopl who are much more knowledg about the way yield curv oper is that the way to interpret this is that there   s an increas in uncertainti about what inflat would be   i hope that our communic strategi will help in that regard   in fact  that provis of inform will actual help the market in the current environ   furthermor  the michigan survey has  if anyth  gotten better in term of inflat expect   i alway get a littl nervous about ask regular peopl what they think becaus if you ask them what they   re watch on tv  they   re never go to tell you that they   re watch vanna white   they   ll tell you that they   re watch ballet or the histori channel   laughter   but i don   t see a problem there  and that the eci number came in the way they did also give me some confid on the inflat front  i am veri concern about     s issu   i alway call presid           becaus we have known each other such a long  e   about be led by the market   it is veri import that we not get into that box   i worri about that  but i am a bit less worri about it in this context in that we affirm last meet that we were not be led by the market becaus we sure as heck surpris them   so the fact that we don   t surpris them this  e to me   not creat a pattern that we   re just do whatev the market tell us  i also want to rais a consider that i think deserv some emphasi  which is think about scenario of what may happen   this relat to what bill talk about  but i want to be a littl more explicit   i want to ask myself what might happen as a result of our polici action today and what the implic might be for the economi   in particular  let   s think about the case of our do altern b   in that case  i think there is a signific probabl that the market would react quit negat and that the macro risk that we took out by our action on septemb    might creep back into the credit market   i   m actual veri worri about the skittish of the credit market   when you   re in a financi disrupt type of world  thing are much more nonlinear   so i would have no disagr at all with   on the issu that  if you are in a normal situat  then you definit do not want to be led by the market at all   but i think that we do have to worri about market consider a bit more in the current situat  when we could have a negat reaction to what we do   that creat problem in the credit market  and then that weaken the outlook for the economi and there is an issu about what do we do then   if we then cut in decemb and cut more than    basi point  that   s realli bad   or if we don   t cut and thing head south  that could be veri  veri problemat  but i do not think that cut today will have veri negat effect on inflat expect   howev  i do think that the issu of go forward is veri import  and this relat to the statement   i strong agre that we need a much stronger balanc and an indic that our action today   if we do what i suggest  which is to cut    basi point     not mean that we expect to cut at the next meet or further out   we realli need to make that veri clear   the statement will be one part of it  although i worri veri much about the issu that we alway put much too much weight on the statement and that we don   t have other mean of communic  i   m not sure what to do about this  i   ve been think about it and haven   t come up with ani good answer   but there are issu in term of how other central bank communic thing beyond the statement that are hard to communic with fifteen word rather than someth more extens  so my view   and it is reflect in my project   is that  if we cut    basi point  it   s not clear to me that the balanc of risk is so much to the downsid   i think the risk to the downsid have been veri substanti elimin   not that they aren   t still there to some extent   i think they are but not realli as much  and i think that is true of the action on septemb    and today  becaus i   m never veri precis in my languag   as you know  i tend to say piti thing   somebodi will craft this much better than i do   but i   m wonder about the assess of risk  let me make a suggest  although i   m not sure this is the best way to do it   we need to emphas that it   s not just the upsid risk to inflat but also the downsid risk to the economi that have lessen   it is also import when we have a    basi point cut not to say to the market that we   re so worri about the economi   one possibl might be  for exampl  to say that    the committe judg that after this action the upsid risk to inflat rough balanc the somewhat reduc downsid risk to growth      so we would not be say that there isn   t some downsid risk but that it   s not realli as strong as we thought   it   s certain not as strong as we thought on septemb      but i think that  with this kind of reduct in rate  it would reduc the risk   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   it   s a littl past         coffe is avail   whi don   t we recess until         thank you   coffe break
let   s recomm with presid
thank you  mr  chairman   fli home last  e i thought it would have been nice to have been at the bank of china and cut      basi point    laughter   i don   t want to repeat what has alreadi been said at the tabl becaus so much has been said   but it is import to note that  sinc we last met  the data on the economi are stronger   some of us have express concern about inflat   credit market  as i said ye day  are at least in remiss  if they haven   t fulli recov  and are in better shape than they were   listen to the argument  i took particular note of presid pool   s comment that he   s not sure that he want to find out what the market reaction would be if we did not cut rate    basi point   i live through three market correct as a market oper                 and        i live through a dollar crisi as a public servant in the u s  treasuri   and i haven   t heard a person yet talk about some of the risk   the riksbank  by the way  last night and the mexican rais rate  but more import  the european are talk tough becaus of their concern about inflat   i am worri about the pernici effect of inflat   i think presid hoenig hit the nail on the head when he said it   s easier to lower than to rais  i would simpli counsel  sinc i don   t have a vote  that we should consid the valu of keep our powder dri   it   s veri danger in my opinion for policymak to be driven into a cul de sac by futur market   in respons to the question i ask earlier  the market have been all over the lot   i am worri that we have too much of a discuss about what market expect of us sinc the fed fund rate is design   as you have made veri clear in your speech  mr  chairman   to affect the economi and should be so driven   so were i to have a vote today  i would be think along the line of presid hoenig     and   in term of their express   everybodi has been grappl with this issu   we would make a great wrestl team  we are think veri hard about these matter   but in the balanc of risk that i see  given the improv in the data  i   m tempt to consid the valu of anoth cut as insur against weak   yet we took a huge step last  e   we took out a doubl barrel shotgun   and it seem to be reflect in the data that the staff project   i   m a littl worri not so much of be accus of be asleep at the wheel but of have our foot too heavili on the acceler if we cut    basi point   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   i  like sever of my colleagu who have gone ahead of me  find myself torn between altern a and b   i also wrestl with mani of the issu that presid   articul so well   i left our septemb meet think that the    basi point cut pretti much put us close to where we need to be given our outlook  and my outlook hasn   t chang much in the past six week   as i said ye day  i   m not certain about whether the weak that i   m hear or have heard about dure this intermeet period is simpli evid of the busi condit that are unfold as i thought they would or whether there is more weak than i anticip in septemb and more weak than i have reflect in my project   the committe has said repeat and for good reason that our decis are go to be depend on the incom data  and as mani have alreadi said  the data seem to be confirm my outlook   but financi market do remain on edg   moreov  mani of the incom data are backward look and  henc  don   t provid me with great comfort when we   re tri to ascertain what might lie ahead   the project that i submit for this meet  as i said ye day  is rather fragil  and it wouldn   t take much addit market turmoil or deterior in household and busi confid to push my near term growth outlook even lower   so i think this risk is the predomin one that we face today  and it is a risk that has weigh heavili on my deliber for this meet  the assess of risk languag in altern b address these concern  and i was contempl support no chang in the fed fund rate and the languag in altern b  howev  in the climat that we find ourselv  i believ that just say that the risk to the outlook is to the downsid isn   t enough   i do think that we should be take out some insur against possibl further deterior in the near term outlook   so i support a    basi point cut in the fed fund rate target today  and i support the languag that   s embodi in altern a   i believ that the languag   acknowledg the like slowdown in the econom expans   it also acknowledg that  if we take this action today  the risk are rough balanc  and import  it suggest that further polici eas may not be forthcom   i also like the languag that was ad regard the recent inflat number   final  as governor   point out  it is difficult to express all of these issu in our short statement   it seem to me that we can draw some comfort from the fact that the minut will be provid the public with a greater understand of the differ view that were express today and some of the challeng that i wrestl with   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   as i comment ye day  i think there   s a respect chanc that by the middl of next year or so the economi will be grow again at a reason rate  and becaus of the lag between our action and their effect on the economi  there is not a lot we can do about what happen in the interven period anyway   it seem to me that those kind of consider are at the heart of someth like the case for altern b   leav well enough alon   there has been some progress in the financi market  and that step   that is  take no action today   would in my view be consist with long term achiev of the dual mandat   but i am an economist   so on the other hand  financi condit are still unsettl  and it   s difficult to know the degre of restraint that chang in the cost and avail of credit relat to condit back in june will have   it might well be prudent   this is the case for altern a   to take addit step today to err on the side perhap of do too much sinc it seem to me that it is inevit that a lot of uncertainti is associ with the econom outlook  weigh those two case  i come down in favor of altern a but with misgiv  and let me share those misgiv   i think that there is some chanc that financi condit will remain unsettl for sever more month at a minimum  and so in some sens that part of the environ may not chang veri much in the next few month   you point out ye day  mr  chairman  that an import ingredi in the  book forecast is a cessat of the drag from hous rough around the middl of next year   let   s suppos that  in fact  turn out to be precis correct   that   s all well and good  but we won   t recogn that it has actual happen with ani degre of confid  given the flow of data  probabl befor august or septemb at the earliest even if the anecdot get a littl more posit   so i can see a situat in which the circumst we confront over the next seri of meet don   t look veri differ from the circumst we   re confront today   i think we have to be veri care of not let good intent on a decis by decis basi get into what turn out to be a polici error as a consequ of an accumul of those kind of decis   it   s the  e inconsist problem obvious  and that give me some paus even though i come out at the moment in favor of altern a  as far as direct languag  for a varieti of reason that other have express  i am uncomfort about character the balanc of risk the way they are character in altern a   i think that a way we might consid go  although it   s not the most eleg solut  is perhap just to drop that first sentenc under altern a   we succeed at the last meet in make it clear that we were data depend  and you had signific swing in probabl of fund rate reduct over the intermeet period   i think this would leav us in that circumst  as presid pianalto point out  we have the minut come out  and we may well have the communic packag  includ the narrat  come out with it   obvious there   s a three week lag  but it seem to me that that would be an effect way of communic what we want to communic and perhap of put the attent on that communic packag  which i think would turn out to be valuabl
gari  i   m a littl puzzl here   i   m not sure i understand   what i understand from your reason is that the key issu is that you don   t want to give an impress that we are go to keep on cut
that   s right
so if you take that first phrase out  you   ve taken out ani issu of balanc of risk   my view is that the market would interpret this as actual indic that the committe would be more like to cut in the futur
well  i don   t know   if you look at the languag from the last meet  we were care not to pre commit to anyth  and it seem to me that the market understood the data depend   i forget the precis number  but i guess the probabl of a   percentag point cut rang from    percent to     percent  or more when you think of it in term of bigger cut  too  it seem to me that the proof of the pud is in the eat   that seem to work out okay
but in this case  if we do altern a  we will have cut
well  i don   t follow that   we cut even more signific at the last meet
thank you  mr  chairman   let me be the most recent but  i guess  not the last to say that this is a close call   i suppos i take more comfort in that than some around the tabl becaus i am pleas at the progress though it is not perfect and we   re not even back to an honest view of normal in the financi market   that it   s a close call suggest to me that the data in the financi market are normal   i guess the altern of a close call would have been to have this be an easi call  and i suspect that the onli way this would have been an easi call would be if we continu to have bad data and bad sen ent in the market   so i think we   re in the realm of a close call and we shouldn   t complet rue that situat   again  that   s probabl a function of the resili of the economi  the resili in the market  some  e and patienc  and mayb even a littl good monetari polici   so i   m okay with that  i think  the judgment that we make on move or not move   percentag point today matter  but it strike me as be consider less import than what the futur path of polici is expect to be in the capit market   so i think that the most import judgment we make is in the fourth paragraph rather than the first paragraph   let me spend a moment on what the financi market are tell us with a degre of certainti which  speak for myself  is quit surpris   again  i think they have respond to real data over the past coupl of week   they haven   t chang their probabl base on utter from the chairman or from ani of us  and i take some comfort in that   i might disagre with what they   re say  but i don   t think that they   re just give us a mirror imag of our own view   so i take what they   re say and the certainti with which they have taken on board that we   re go to move today   it   s not determin   it   s not disposit  nor should it be  but the debt capit market  at least  think that the economi is wors   wors than the  book and wors than mani of us feel   again  i would say that i have to take that on board without give it too much predict capabl  i think that   is right   given the fragil in the financi market and given the surpris that we had for them last  e  i wouldn   t want our judgment today to add to that volatil  which i think would be quit possibl   in sum  i would say that i support altern a as written on this revis page   i think that  absent have strong languag in altern a  section    it would look to some as though the market dictat this outcom   i think a   and robust balanc of risk languag is import so that the market don   t believ incorrect that we succumb to what their want are   i think that previous  includ at our last meet  when we spoke about uncertainti  they seem to understand what that was   that it wasn   t that we   re just call it uncertainti but we realli have cut ahead   for better or for wors  they   ve now learn a lesson   uncertainti with even pretti good data led us to cut this  e  if we end up adopt altern a   so if we use that same uncertainti languag  i don   t think it would have the effect that it had last  e of let folk be on both side of the bet on whether we would have continu action   so i   m comfort with altern a  paragraph     it is a way of address market expect and address our uncertainti by insur  but be veri clear to the market that they ought not prejudg nor have we prejudg the outcom next  e   the refer to inflat risk there and in altern a  paragraph    are use to address some of the broader concern we have about commod and the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   so with that  i think that altern a is the right thing to do and that it   preserv for us plenti of abil to call it as we see it when we meet next   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   governor
thank you   as i discuss ye day  i take veri much a risk manag approach   but i also like the way that presid   character that risk manag approach as your have to think about the cost and the benefit and veri much focus on the potenti cost   so in think about the best way to go  i think about if we do or don   t move  then what are the downsid risk to each   we   ve seen  as mani peopl have said  a lot of progress in the financi market   we have also seen a littl back up of some of that progress and a flatten out over the past coupl of week   in particular  the one set of market that we haven   t seen as much progress in as certain i would like is hous relat market   that is for me the most direct channel between financi turmoil and the real economi  as i describ ye day  my tail risk scenario is sort of a slow burn scenario   it is not one in which this financi turmoil will get out of control and we will have an incred mess so we need to cut interest rate to prevent it   i think that was more the concern and focus in our previous meet   we have seen improv  although i don   t think we   ve seen normal  particular in the hous market   given that we   ve had some but not full normal and then given that we have reset come and the tighten of credit standard  the elimin of a lot of subprim lend  the rule that we are go to put out  and the rule that the congress is consid  regardless of how care we craft them or whether or not the congress make progress  the effect on the hous market will undoubt be somewhat chill   so i see a potenti slow burn scenario in which it is valuabl to be buy some insur against that as earli as possibl   these problem may be peak toward the middl of next year  becaus that   s when they have the most potenti to have a negat effect on hous price  which  as other have describ  could have this sort of simultan issu or vicious cycl aspect that could lead thing to go down  given that we have those condit and we have that potenti go forward  it seem worthwhil to buy that insur now   what is the cost of do that   of cours  it is in term of inflat and inflat expect   as the market have chang their expect about what we   re like to do at this meet and even as they have dramat chang their path of futur polici move  there   s veri littl evid that inflat expect  at least up to the five year horizon  have move up signific   there is a question of how to interpret that longer term chang in inflat expect  i take it veri serious  and i think we have to tri to understand it better   but i don   t think that there   s an enorm cost in term of move now versus six to nine month from now to buy more insur against what i see as a challeng from the recent financi market turbul   i think there is also a concern  which presid pool rais  that if we have a fair larg surpris to the market  it could reduc or even revers some of the progress that has been made in some of the market  potenti forc us to move more than we would like at the next meet  so that said  i think it is veri import and veri valuabl that we make a move now   as other have said  it is a close call becaus we have to worri about the cost with respect to inflat  one way to contain that cost  as a number of peopl have said  is to clarifi the path go forward  to show that what we   re do now is respond not to current data but to the forecast about the data   obvious when the market were expect gdp at     and it come in at      we   re not say that we   re react to current market data by make a cut   but we are think about the potenti futur effect and then tri to give some guidanc through a balanc of risk statement  i   m open to a modif of that statement to tri to convey that we think we don   t necessarili need to do more with respect to the challeng that are come now but we   re go to continu to remain vigil and look at thing like the hous market and other market that have potenti to have negat ramif for the whole economi   thank
thank you   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i think the economi is slow   even the nonhous part of the economi is slow a bit   hous price are still obvious slide down   we don   t realli claim to know much about where they   re go to end up or where we are in that process  but it seem that they are fall and probabl at an acceler rate   our modal forecast      our    mean from the submiss   is for an economi that slow further and run below trend over sever quarter   but if you just look at the size of the bar on the submiss  the size of that bar about downsid risk to growth is veri high  much higher than the bar about upsid risk to inflat   there is a huge amount of uncertainti about what equilibrium is and where short term interest rate should be over  e   but i think it is fair to say that we are now at the high end of  if not slight abov  most of those es  of where equilibrium is   therefor  it seem to me sensibl that most of our submiss had a downward slope to the path of the fed fund rate go forward over this period  the question then is not princip whether to move but when and what signal of a chang or no chang should come   i think it is a veri close call  and everyth that i say i say with a lot of uneas and discomfort   if the choic is to stay firm but to signal more explicit than we did in septemb that we   re like to move further  that seem to me just a bad choic   i think it is like to amplifi mani of the risk that you are all worri about and it probabl would make peopl more tentat about come in and do what they   re go to do to let this thing work through the market becaus they will be live with our acknowledg of substanti downsid risk without action and uncertainti about whether we   re go to move   i think you might argu that a decis not to move with an explicit asymmetri in the balanc of risk to growth would lower the path go forward and add to that uncertainti in some sens  i do not think that the market are so fragil now that they could not take an advers surpris of this magnitud  even though it is a veri  veri larg advers surpris relat to recent histori   i don   t think that   s a good argument for move   i think the best argument is that we   re still in the midst of what is a veri delic and consequenti asset price adjust in the u s  economi with a fair dens  thick  advers tail on the potenti implic about the evolut in hous   the chairman spoke eloqu earli in the year   i think it was earli in the year  but mayb it was late last year   about the pattern of histori and the acknowledg that weak tend to cumul  and you don   t realli have a lot of experi with sustain period of below trend growth without fall into a more substanti rise in unemploy rate   those risk have to be substanti greater when you have an economi go through this kind of asset price adjust  i found these chart discourag  not reassur  in the sens that we   re anticip a slowdown in the rate of growth of credit for the economi as a whole that   s compar to         i think the pressur on bank balanc sheet is probabl   it   s hard to make these statement with ani certainti   greater than it was in         at least a reason expect is that it   s go to be bigger than it was in hindsight in        and i think you have a much more substanti impair to the function of what kevin call debt capit market   the industri around the design of securit and structur financ  et cetera  which has been so import to the way credit get origin and move   that disrupt could take a long  e to resolv  and i think that just has to amplifi the densiti of the advers tail and the growth outcom  certain with more uncertainti at this  e  i think that it is hard  but the better cours of valor is to move today  and i like the languag in altern a   let me just go quick through the argument against it that i find most compel   the best argument against is the fear that mani of us spoke about   that even though the inflat number have been reason reassur and we haven   t seen substanti eros in inflat expect that we can measur  there is a bit of deterior in the feel  in the psycholog   we have to be veri care that we don   t add to that through our action or peopl   s expect about how we   re go to behav go forward   but we should take some comfort from the fact that the market is price in more than     basi point of eas over the next two year   you have to believ that a fair amount of that is alreadi reflect in breakeven  reflect in what peopl are will to pay for insur against advers inflat outcom  and reflect in the dollar   it  sn   t mean that if we valid part of those expect you won   t see eros  but we should take some comfort from that  just one more thing   we have been through three year of veri substanti relat price shock in energi price  commod price  and some other thing   those hit an economi that was grow over the period abov most es  of potenti  and we have had pretti good perform of under inflat and inflat expect in that context   so even though we look forward and we see what   s happen in commod price  energi price  and the dollar as pose some potenti risk of upsid pressur on input cost  that is hit the economi in a veri differ state   the experi of those last coupl of year should give us a fair amount of confid in the judgment we bring as to how we think about inflat go forward   i think we have less uncertainti around an inflat forecast than we would have had two or three year ago and still substanti uncertainti around the growth forecast inevit given what the economi is go through   the balanc suggest that it is better to move today becaus of that   as i said  i   m comfort with the languag in altern a   i would be comfort with governor     s amend to a   i think that help a bit   i have a lot of sympathi for all the argument against the first sentenc in altern a in ani form  but on balanc  i would say that we just don   t want to take the risk that  by omit some statement like it  we caus peopl to price in a steeper slope to that path go forward   it is someth that we should tri to avoid  and the best way to achiev that is the languag in a   thank you
thank you   thank you all   well  it has been said mani  e  but this is veri  veri close  and i   ve thought about it quit a bit  obvious   i have a lot of sympathi for presid     s veri clear analysi   there have been good data sinc the last meet   we have talk about the import of spillov   we have not so far seen evid spillov from hous into other sector   we did take a preemptiv action in the last meet   inflat is a concern   i think not immedi  but some of the factor like input cost are there  and market expect alon are obvious not a reason to move   all of those thing are valid  and i have thought about all of them  so whi do i favor a cut   most of the argument have been made   the downsid risk are quit signific  if the hous situat  includ price  realli deterior   i think part of the differ between what the market see about hous and what we see is that we are a littl more sanguin about price behavior than the market is  and a declin in price has effect both on consum and on the credit system   so i think that risk is fair import and may swamp some of the other issu   there is some new inform that is relev   the senior loan offic survey and other inform suggest that credit condit are tighten and that this will have an effect  i believ  in some signific market  certain includ hous   other inform  like consum sen ent and consum    view of the labor market  suggest some slow and some weaken  the declin in sen ent in the market in the past two week is veri interest   on one level i feel as though we fail to communic somehow  howev  i don   t know exact where the mistak was   the market seem to be respond to inform about earn report and project of futur activ and so on  both in the financi sector and in the real sector  and as a number of peopl have said  i don   t think we can entir ignor that inform   so i think there are some good reason on the real side to take out a bit more insur  as has been said   i agre with the vice chairman that the credit market probabl could stand the surpris  but they have becom somewhat more uncertain  and i think their basic problem is macro uncertainti   it has to do with concern about tail risk  and that is someth that we can  i think  address a bit  the point has been made a number of  e  first by presid    that the current rate could be constru as be slight restrict and that creat an argument for a somewhat lower rate   an addit argument is that the core inflat rate has come down some sinc last year  and so the real feder fund rate on that basi has gone up  final  an argument that i would bring to you is about tactic  and the vice chairman also allud to this   most of the path that we submit includ a path for polici that is perhap slight lower than the current one  and the question is how we do this   if we take altern b  which i think is the most obvious altern  on the one hand we don   t take an action and on the other hand we express alarm about the economi and say we   ll probabl be cut in the futur   that make calibr how the longer term expect will respond to that veri difficult   i think it would  on balanc  tighten expect a bit becaus we didn   t act  but it   creat some uncertainti   the advantag of altern a  even as we take a cut  is that we will  i hope  curb expect for sustain addit cut through sever mechan   first  in the econom growth paragraph  we have switch languag from action    intend to help forestal      veri indirect   to    should help forestal     suggest that we are now more confid in our abil to prevent bad outcom in the economi   second  we have   and this will certain be notic   taken note of energi and commod price  among other factor  and we have highlight our concern about inflat  third  the rough balanc of risk certain indic that we are not eager to cut again quick unless the data clear support it   so a lot of this is tactic  about how to take control of expect   you know  how to manag the market   s view of our polici   and i just felt a bit more comfort with take the action but then use that to recalibr our balanc of risk   for what it is worth     basi point of eas has been pretti much the standard fed medicin for financi crise ever sinc      or so  in that respect we are in good compani   that   s my recommend      basi point with altern a   ani question or comment
with the   amend or without
what exact was the   amend
it was to add a phrase befor the downsid risk to growth to say     the committe judg that the upsid risk to inflat rough balanc the somewhat reduc downsid risk to growth      it would give a flavor that  in fact  our action have reduc the downsid risk
i worri about that   for exampl  by say that the action    should help forestal    instead of    is intend to forestal    i think we address that
i didn   t feel strong about this   it was just mayb i   ll do it in speech afterward
the other comment that came up  i think presid hoenig and presid  n mention it  is not exact soften but emphas the uncertainti that surround our judgment   so anoth possibl  and i have alway regret make suggest on the statement  is that we could take the first sentenc from the septemb paragraph    cut out the phrase    sinc the committe   s last regular meet     and say     develop in financi market have increas the uncertainti surround the econom outlook   howev  the committe judg that           and we could put that at the begin of the assess of risk   is that as appeal   i don   t know   i guess my prejudic is  unless there is strong sen ent  to stay with what we have becaus that is what peopl have talk about
i think the problem with that is that develop of financi market on balanc sinc the last meet have been reassur   the panic has reced  the disrupt are more contain  and so i don   t think that work
okay   i withdraw that   ani other comment   all right   if not  ms    will call the roll   let   s just note for the record that for the first  e we will be vote on the entir statement
i will start with the direct from the bluebook   the languag is as follow     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with reduc the feder fund rate to an averag of around     percent     then the statement  which i will not read in it entireti  is as written under altern a in the revis octob    tabl that was hand out  chairman bernank vice chairman    presid    presid hoenig governor kohn   governor    governor   presid pool  presid   governor
thank you veri much   i need to have the board for a yes yes yes no yes yes yes yes yes yes         moment   meet recess
let me just address quick the last item on the agenda  which is communic   on octob     you receiv a memo from the subcommitte that describ the latest round of chang to the project   i won   t repeat what they are  but if there are question  we can take them   i don   t believ we receiv ani comment on this round   i   ll talk in a moment about get this readi for prime  e   but what i   d like to talk about now is  as i discuss in septemb  ask the committe for a consensus to releas these project   they would be releas with the minut of the current meet on novemb     which is one day less than three week becaus wednesday is the day befor thanksgiv   so we would releas it on tuesday  the necessari explan of the project   what they mean and how to interpret them   would be in a speech that i propos to give on novemb      that speech would be preced by a press releas from the fomc describ the plan in general term   you receiv copi of the press releas   michell  do we have other copi     anyon need it
it was not chang from what you receiv   i have extra copi if you need one
all right   if anyon need a copi  michell is happi to give you one   i would talk in general term about this approach  whi we   re do it  what the implic are  and so on   i   d be happi to share my draft remark with anyon who would like to look at them   let me be clear   i do not plan to reveal ani of the data from the project   they would be releas to the public for the first  e in the minut  and so it would obvious be veri import for everyon not to releas that inform   presid
your speech is novemb
my speech is novemb     and the releas of the minut will be on novemb      that would give peopl some  e to digest the idea   yes
and the press releas
the press releas would be on the morn of novemb    befor my speech   on previous occas when the fomc has announc communic chang  they have follow the meet by some week   it   s not unusu for that to happen  there are question about  e  whether we should think about do it later   we had some discuss about this   my own view is that this was the most conveni  e   januari would run into the monetari polici hear  for exampl   if there are serious problem in the market or anyth like that  i am prepar to add materi about the market or to substitut anoth speech   to do whatev is necessari to address that issu   but i do think that  besid the natur rhythm and the fact that we are about as far as we are go to get in fine tune this  the fact that this has appear in the press suggest that we should just go ahead and get it out soon  if possibl   in a moment i   m go to ask you for your comment  and then i   ll ask you for your consensus   first  on releas the materi and  second  on the speech and the rollout of the press releas  let me just say that  as   indic  we do have until tomorrow close of busi to revis our project   this count   this is the real thing   pleas take a look at your project in light of this morn   s data and in light of the discuss today   in the futur we will not be do this everi meet  onli four  e a year   so in that respect it won   t be such a burden as i know it has been   so i urg you pleas to do that   let me now open the floor for ani comment or question about project  the rollout plan  or anyth   presid pool
i have two comment     talk about the skew  which i gather we are go to describ in word but not use the histogram   i have the follow question about the skew   i was one of those who said    broad similar     and here   s how i would look at it   you start with some point es    let   s make it simpl   next year  fourth quarter to fourth quarter  you ask yourself how far down you would have to move the point es  such that the probabl to the right and the left would be about the same   if the amount that you would have to move that point es  is a fraction of a standard error  then i would interpret it  rough speak  as that there are symmetr risk   i just have the suspicion that peopl who are talk about    weight to the downsid    are in a way mix up the first moment and the third moment of the probabl distribut   so i worri that  as i think   was worri  that this will give a messag that   s go to interfer with the communic that we also want to offer about the polici path   that   s the best way i can think about it   to ask about how far you would have to move your point es  to make the probabl to the right or left rough the same   i would also note that the  book  for exampl  has reduc the point es  for next year   percentag point from june to now  rough speak   mayb i can even ask dave about whether he think the distribut around the current point es  is veri skew  and i could also go on and ask how far down he would have to move that point es  to make the probabl to the right and left about the same  the other point that i want to make   and it is realli in mani way a much more import point   is that  when we disclos the      inflat project and presum  mr  chairman  at the februari monetari polici hear   assum that some member of the congress actual ask you a question relat to monetari polici  which is not a given    laughter  a veri logic question either then or some  in the futur would be where you person stand  what your number is in that project   i would veri much like to know that answer in advanc becaus i would be more than happi to conform my es   which i regard as a target  to the number that you would throw out  i think there   s an issu here   in an inflat project for      that vari from rough     to    the number are materi differ  and i think that question is go to come back at us over and over again   so i won   t say ani more about that  but i do believ that i would hate to be in a posit of have to explain whi my number is differ from your
well  let me say first on the mode and the median  you make a good point on the first issu about risk   the question to ask yourself is  given your most like forecast  on which side are the largest and most cost deviat most like to occur   in which direct are the risk skew   that is the way to think about it
well  i would keep separ the cost from the distribut itself
no  i don   t think so   i think you ought to put in some cost
i   m not say i would ignor the cost  but mayb we need to be clear about what this probabl distribut is suppos to mean   i thought that this was suppos to mean simpli the weight that i would give on various possibl outcom in term of the probabl that the forecast might be   percentag point below or   percentag point abov the central tendenc  howev i describ it   now  i agre that a full analysi requir that you also add the cost to those  but i would interpret that as not be part of the project process for gdp and inflat but rather you   d fold that in through the polici decis as to how you weight those various possibl outcom   but i have interpret it all along as be realli a statement about your probabl distribut on the outcom unweight by the sever of the outcom
okay   i think that the answer would be pretti similar in either case   so we can discuss this at anoth  e   on your second question  i think i   m kind of a special case becaus peopl will overweight what i say if i give a number   so i would not give a number  and what i would say is that what matter are the view of the broad committe  and i don   t want to distinguish myself from the broad committe   it is a committe decis process   if individu want to give their number  i suppos that   s okay   but i would urg you to consid the extern a bit  which is that there will be some desir to figur out who is where on the distribut in order to assess who is hold which type of polici prefer and so on   certain mani of us have often given our view of what price stabil is and so on   i don   t think i want to prohibit that  but my recommend would be to be a littl fuzzi  a bit care about be too precis and too sharp about that number
well  it won   t realli matter veri much with me becaus i will be out of here befor too long  but i have long been on record as bring the number down  and so i can   t back off that   that   s what i believ  and so i   m go to keep that
that   s fine
but i   ll disappear from the calculus next spring anyway
mr  chairman  i appreci your answer   the one worri i have had about this exercis  which is much better the way it is now express and present   i think it is readi for prime  e   is that we might be divid as to our individu instinct   we do oper as a committe   we have said this a million  e  but i   d like to reiter it   to me it   s the last bastion of integr here in washington   to go down a path of who is say what just threaten to tear us apart  and i would urg your respons on everybodi els as well   thank you for the spirit in which you answer that
anybodi els   presid
has there been ani reaction to the greg ip stori   have we receiv ani feedback from the princip audienc for the project
yes  and there have been no problem   the respons has been posit
mr  chairman
yes  vice chairman   i   m sorri
i want to come back to presid pool   s question  presid pool  you said a fraction of a standard error   how larg a fraction of a standard error would you want to use as a basi   realli  i   m not sure what the standard error is in this context  but just in term of how you think about this  how larg a fraction of the standard error
well  i was one of those who put down b   that both the distribut and the skew were broad similar to the past twenti year   so i came out that way   i was tri to offer a way to think about this issu and  for those who believ that the probabl distribut is way over on one side  a way to think about it   how far would you have to move that point es    i wasn   t tri to give the answer  i was tri to give a way to approach the question
mr  chairman  mayb we should clarifi just this one point   did you leav the question about   i don   t know what this chart is call  it is not go to be in the addendum to the minut   what those bar show about the balanc of risk   is it about just the probabl of the outcom or about the probabl of outcom and the cost or consequ of the outcom
may i ask the staff  do you have institut memori on this question
i am not sure what the question is exact   what is the question
is the skew that determin the risk simpli the probabl of outcom  or is it the probabl weight by the cost of certain outcom
well  i think it is a matter of how the member interpret it in respond    laughter   the memorandum to the committe ask whether the risk around your project for each variabl are weight to the upsid  weight to the downsid  or broad balanc
i think the balanc of risk statement in the announc has had the util weight on it  there have been  e when the committe was more concern about fall to one side or anoth   but i at least interpret the forecast as simpli whether there were skew to one side or anoth   if i may have the floor to talk a bit to presid pool   s point   i think we do say in the statement that there are upsid risk to inflat and downsid risk to growth   so i would be concern if the whole committe shift to the middl becaus then i think we would be contradict the announc that we made  so i think your point is good   i mean  you ought to be sure that you realli do think there is downsid risk to growth and upsid risk to inflat  or whatev  and adjust it for the polici choic that we made today
the util cost is relev in the statement  and you can   t take a balanc of risk unless you compar them in term of cost   there is no other metric by which you can compar them   so in that case  it has to be cost weight   but i think it is more or less equival   the univari answer you are give about mode versus median
but if we view the project as be a statement just about the probabl distribut of the various outcom  this might be an import point for you to explain in the speech that you give becaus the whole thing is label project   i guess we have been call it a    project exercis      and so i have interpret that as a discuss of the number
i think we won   t go too far wrong by interpret it as a probabl distribut in the shape of the probabl distribut for outcom
that   s the way i have interpret it
okay   presid
at the risk of introduc further moment of the probabl distribut into the discuss  have we been instruct as to whether our project is a mean or a maximum likelihood es
i think our standard procedur is that it is a modal
a maximum likelihood es
the memorandum to the committe say     pleas provid your project of the most like outcom     et cetera
i   m sorri  presid    we have kept you wait
it   s not import   i don   t have ani comment   i just want to say that i think the staff has done a great job and the subcommitte has done a great job   this is a veri import step forward for us  and i am strong support of it   i want to thank governor kohn       and the other member of the subcommitte for get us here and you for take this step forward   i believ that  as we go through this  e after  e  it will be refin  we will stumbl over a few thing and the languag is go to be t i  but i just want to commend the committe for take this step
let me also commend governor kohn  presid  n  and presid   for their excel work   we realli appreci it   governor
thank you   i just want to return to the point that the chairman  presid pool  and presid   rais   in my convers  peopl have express differ view at this junctur about what the op  long run inflat rate is   peopl know that i am a   percent kind of guy  and i know good peopl here who are     percent kind of guy   but in talk to peopl about this  i hear a lot more consensus and that peopl don   t feel strong   so i would be in concert with what presid pool said   if the chairman said     how about x      i would be more than happi to say     giddyap  i am with the chairman      so  again  my color languag   but the key point here is that i think it would be veri help at this junctur that peopl realli not emphas differ but that  in fact  there realli is consensus on this committe   that take one of two form   one is if you had someth in the past  that   s fine  but you can say that you had that in the past but you are actual comfort with where the general committe is  and that way you can soften it   two is a case in which somebodi like me has not actual public talk about an inflat goal   in that case  i would keep my mouth shut on the issu   in term of this initi launch   again emphas the fact that there realli is a lot of consensus on the committe becaus we know that the press love to creat the opposit of consensus becaus it sell newspap   the more we can be support and to the extent that we can look unifi on this  the better off we are   i sens that is actual where the committe is  so i would encourag it in this process
i just want a clarif   in the explan  will we say that the project are base on what we have done   for exampl  today  given that we are have a polici move and i am not sure that everyon around the tabl had anticip that move today in their path  will we be articul that these are not the number that we came into the meet with  but these are the number that we think after the polici action has been taken
yes  let   s do that becaus it will be more consist with the statement   so let me ask everyon to rethink their risk condit on our polici move today
sorri  mr  chairman  two point   one is a concern to which i have no solut   the chart that is now call chart    which has evolv over  e  has a slight disadvantag  becaus it  sn   t have fan around it becaus we all didn   t like the fan  of have the sens of a pretti narrow rang of like outcom for the futur   i just wonder whether anybodi is uneasi  given the relat low probabl that we are go to end up within those over  e   i don   t have a solut to this   i was wonder whether  if you chang the scale    laughter    this is a concern with no real suggest solut   i apolog   my second point is more signific   bill  i think you ask a good question   mr  chairman  anoth question that is interest is  when ask whether the world should interpret the central tendenc of the committe at a three year horizon for pce inflat as the rate that is consist with the committe   s long run view of price stabil  how will you answer it
it repres the divers of view on the committe about that  with the addit caveat that not everyon may necessarili believ that we will approach their ideal level of price stabil even in three year  conceiv   so it is a mixtur of element  and that   s what i will talk about   again  if you would like to look at the speech
no   i think that is consist with how it is describ and what is discuss  but it just goe to the point that  bill  you rais  which is for some of you your op  horizon is alway go to be two year or three year   but you said all that could be said  i think  about that
mr  chairman
i   m sorri  but i need to understand what you just impli   are we to go back now and redo our project for this meet under the assumpt that we took the action today
if you wouldn   t mind  yes
and appropri polici go forward
okay   but it   s not what i base my decis on
tom  if you took a view about what appropri polici was last friday and you have a chanc now to assess  in light of what the committe did  what appropri polici is go forward  whether that has chang  and what implic that chang has for your forecast   isn   t that the way to say it
but the whole point of the process was to prepar us for this meet  and now i am go to go back and reassess the process i went through in light of what took place in this meet   if everyon is comfort with do that  then i would be happi and abl to do it   at least i understand that we are all go in the same direct that way   so i am fine with it  as long as that is what  in fact  we   re do
but the  book won   t be chang   this confus me a bit   i wasn   t quit clear   i thought i was  but i guess i wasn   t
we can do whatev we want as long as we all agre to do the same thing    laughter
if that   s it  then i   ll go back and do it   i just want to make sure that   s what we all agre we   re go to do   if that is  then fine  but i didn   t have that understand befor you made that statement
is there an inconsist in adjust a forecast after the meet when the minut are the minut of the meet and the forecast inform the judgment that were express in the meet
no  i don   t think so   it is base on the inform in the meet  includ the data we receiv this morn
i   m not sure i see minut reflect subsequ action or subsequ decis
we   re releas this with the minut
we   re releas it with the minut   it   s not part of the minut
oh  okay   good point
it   s like an annual report that has updat inform in it   as long as everyon is do the same thing
i hope  presid hoenig  that you won   t be in this situat too often    laughter
i   ve got a long record  and i haven   t been in this situat too often   but i have been in this situat befor
ani other question or comment   may i have the sens of the committe to proceed with the releas   thank you veri much   i appreci it  and i appreci everyon   s hard work and cooper   i think this is a veri import step  and i am veri pleas with the outcom   let me just describ now the sequenc of event   i will now give you the date of the next meet  and i will adjourn the meet   la  blanchard is here to talk briefli about congression issu for us  and the lunch for cathi   begin at         okay   so our next meet will be tuesday  decemb      the meet is adjourn    end of meet
