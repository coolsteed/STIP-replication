without object  they are approv   dino kos
thank you  mr  chairman   with the outcom of this meet firm price into market  the intermeet period was character by more than usual attent to exchang rate develop   dollar sen ent was bearish for most of the period  and thus the market was caught offsid by last week   s sudden appreci   the behavior of asian central bank  from both a polici and a portfolio perspect  grip the market dure much of the period and continu to do so   the top panel on page   graph the three month u s  and euro denomin deposit rate   the solid red and   line depict libor fix   the dash line graph the three month deposit rate nine month forward for both currenc   with the tighten cycl advanc in the unit state  short term rate   repres by the solid red line   are now higher than in the euro area   howev  perhap the more interest point is what has happen to forward rate   at the  e of your septemb meet  nine month forward rate for both dollar and euro deposit rate were about     percent   sinc then forward dollar rate have risen along with general posit data   meanwhil  euro forward rate have declin and now sit veri close to the cash rate   with econom data in europ show sluggish and with the strength of the euro advers affect export prospect  the ecb   s earlier expect tighten has been price out  and mani in the market are talk about a possibl eas   look at a somewhat longer  e frame  the bottom left panel graph u s    german three month interest rate differenti sinc the begin of the year   dollar interest rate have gone from be     basi point lower to be almost    the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix          percentag point higher   at the long end of the curv  as shown at the bottom right  the relationship is more volatil   but there  too  dollar interest rate are higher by about    percentag point   with the most recent widen driven almost entir by a fall in german yield  as recent data disappoint   i should note that japanes yield  although not shown here  also have fallen modest  as incom data were disappoint there as well   the favor shift in interest rate differenti might have been expect to help the valu of the dollar   howev  as shown at the top of page    the dollar has been on a downward trend   in mid novemb  comment about the current account by secretari snow and chairman  span in the day surround the g    meet in europ were interpret by some as signal acquiesc to the dollar   s fall  though sen ent was so bearish at the  e that perhap ani comment might have had the same respons   with the market so one side  it did becom vulner to a sudden revers  even in the absenc of ani fundament news   the extent of the posit can be seen in the middl panel  which graph the imm   s net noncommerci posit for three major currenc   the euro  the yen  and  l   against the dollar   after a rather unev summer  specul began to build up short dollar posit in earli fall   by mid novemb sen ent was overwhelm bearish and posit extend   as some account began to reduc risk  there was posit squar in sever so call crowd trade  includ these short dollar posit  which fed last week   s appreci   the dollar   s fall is certain affect return on u s  asset for foreign   the bottom panel graph the return year to date for a varieti of asset class and for the u s  dollar index   return for most asset class clu  around   percent  with high yield bond be higher  but for foreign investor  return for most class are closer to zero  given the near   percent fall in the dollar   anoth focus of market attent has been the behavior of asian central bank from both a polici and a portfolio perspect   page   provid updat of two chart i show at the last meet   the top panel graph the chines yuan spot rate   fix at        and the one   six   and twelv month forward rate deriv from nondeliver forward that are trade offshor and settl in dollar   this is a small market  but it is one of the few indic of specul interest regard the size and  e of a possibl revalu of the yuan   sinc your last meet  the forward discount have widen  as specul grew of a near term chang in the regim  this is despit premier wen   s comment that ani move to make the exchang rate more flexibl would not come if there were pressur from foreign or from the market   that   place china   s offici in a box sinc they have conced the principl  and one would expect that market will intermitt price in a chang in the regim   meanwhil  other asian countri have allow some appreci against the dollar   and therefor against the yuan   in recent month  as shown in the middl panel   howev  the pace of reserv accumul has again begun to rise  suggest that the author are near their limit   japan  on the other hand  has not    interven  perhap in part becaus the rise of the korean won and other currenc mean that japan   s effect exchang rate has not risen as much as the yen   s bilater rate against the dollar   investor have watch close these countri    willing to toler further appreci   but they are watch at least as close how these countri are manag the reserv they have accumul   there are two dimens to this question   first  are these central bank diversifi away from the dollar   sever week ago a russian central bank offici public disclos that the russian central bank had shift some of it dollar reserv into euro   that announc and   until recent   the steadi declin in the dollar fed specul that asian central bank might act similar   of cours  if there were a shift from dollar to euro  the immedi effect would be a further appreci of the euro  which would result in an addit reduct in the valu of the asian central bank    remain dollar  also  a further appreci of the euro is someth the ecb might resist at some point   to date  sever asian central bank have said that they have no plan to chang their currenc alloc  though market particip are wari   the second dimens of the question is whether central bank are diversifi their dollar hold from treasuri into other asset class   hard data on this point are hard to come by   anecdot  those central bank with larg reserv hold have been grow both their treasuri and non treasuri hold for some  e  though it   s fair to say that the growth rate of agenc  mbs  and even corpor hold have been fa  than that for treasuri   the bottom panel graph the new york fed   s aggreg custodi hold for treasuri and agenc sinc the start of the year   i should stress that this is an incomplet data set sinc central bank also hold secur with other custodian   nevertheless  this   suggest that   especi in recent week   there has been a spike in agenc hold wherea treasuri hold have been flat   we are awar of one major account that sold outright some of it treasuri and re alloc into agenc   sinc the buy and sell for such secur are conduct with differ counterparti  it is entir possibl that those dealer see the sale of treasuri may have extrapol in think that this account was also sell the under dollar   and thus fed some of the rumor in recent week    turn to domest market on the next page  the short intermeet period featur a continu of recent trend   spread are low and  if anyth  have narrow further   impli volatil continu at veri low level  and the price of oil continu to fall while price of equiti rose   the top panel of page   graph the two year to ten year spread   the yield curv has continu to flatten though there was a sharp  if brief  steepen in late novemb driven more by technic factor than ani fundament news   onc the unwind subsid  the curv resum it flatten trend and at     basi point is at it flattest level in more than three year  financi condit remain favor   as note  corpor and emerg market spread are narrow   the middl panel graph the absolut yield level for the embi  and high yield index sinc        the combin of a lower treasuri curv and    narrow spread has lower absolut yield to level where financi comedian are ask if the name of the high yield index will need to be chang   final  mortgag spread continu to trade at low level  as shown in the bottom left panel   the larg hold of mbs previous accumul by bank continu to attract attent on the theori that a sudden spread widen would trigger this group of investor to start liquid these posit   turn to page    let me provid a quick updat on the growth of outright treasuri hold in the system open market account   the top panel graph the net expans of the soma from      through        not surpris  there is a correl over the long term between the growth of currenc in circul and the growth of soma   dure this ten year period  currenc in circul grew by     billion per year  averag over the y k event    through novemb      it has increas by     billion this year   although similar in dollar magnitud to prior year  that repres a slowdown in currenc growth from about    percent in the           period to just under   percent this year   the somewhat slower currenc growth that has emerg in recent year appear to reflect weaker oversea demand  the bottom panel graph the feder reserv   s direct net currenc shipment go back to        a somewhat longer period than in the first two panel   i should note that these data cover onli the fed   s shipment and receipt   we do not know how much currenc left the countri   or came back   via migrant worker  tourist  and other legal or illeg mean  though we have no evid to suggest that those relationship have chang in recent year   in mani year through       foreign growth compos the bulk of overal currenc growth   start in       shipment oversea began to moder  and averag out y k effect  the overal trend of foreign shipment has been fall and in the last two year has turn negat   without the signific shipment to argentina and iraq in recent year  these number would have been lower still   mr  chairman  that conclud my prepar remark   there were no foreign oper in the period   i will need approv of domest oper  and i   d be happi to take ani question
with respect to the direct net currenc shipment abroad  recent i have seen reconcili between other techniqu that endeavor to get to the aggreg amount of currenc held abroad and the direct currenc shipment   are those other techniqu indic much the same stori   i presum  with the growth of currenc in circul slow and with the foreign piec such a huge part of that  that a direct measur of shipment look much like what we es  is the total   is that accur
i believ so   but as i said  we don   t see the currenc that leav the countri   or that can come back in   by other mean   there seem to be a correl between the middl panel and the bottom panel  but again  there is a lot of slippag becaus of other way currenc can leav the countri   but i have not seen a firm reconcili
the way we es  foreign hold from the stock of currenc is not a bad techniqu   inde  as i recal  the sever differ measur yield rough the same result   so  the implic is that the net chang in that es  stock less the direct shipment is  inde  a presum    other    compon plus statist error     that tend to be a small number or a larg number
i can   t say that i can tell you
i don   t have that either  mr  chairman  but i would note that our es  of growth in foreign held currenc are actual still somewhat larger for this year than for domest currenc  despit the negat net shipment that dino refer to   for instanc  we are project that foreign currenc is grow about    percent for      as a whole  wherea domest currenc growth we es  at about   percent
so that suggest that there   s an unexplain signific residu   on the imm trader report  to what extent are the net long and short posit use in anticip chang in rate   my presumpt is that  histor  if there was a relationship  it disappear as soon as somebodi observ it   what are the fact
we actual did some work on this   bob  do you rememb the paper that we did a few year ago
i think the basic conclus there was that those data do seem to have some predict power  but they are releas with such a long lag that they are not use for trader on a real  e basi
but there is other evid that   suggest that  when everybodi becom absolut commit to the view that a currenc is go to move in one direct or the other  one can alway make money on the other side of that transact   at least that   s my recollect of histori   but i guess sinc nobodi know what these data are in real  e  one can   t make that statement
peopl do use these data some  as a contrari indic   for the veri reason that you note
but if they do see a relationship  it disappear
that   s the risk
other question for dino
with the possibl except of these posit vis  vis the dollar  there seem to be a remark number of indic   spread are narrow  the yield curv is flatter  and so forth   that suggest that market particip see less risk   yet the risk seem to be out there   we hear peopl talk about that all the  e   some of this bet against the dollar reflect the intern risk have to do with the size of our deficit and the way the currenc market are go   there is a potenti for market to get upset about fiscal deficit go forward   there seem to be a lot of risk out there  but we don   t see it in the curv much   do peopl talk about that at all
yes   the short answer is yes   they have observ   especi over the last year    ani number of thing that should have and did creat uncertainti   yet there was this dichotomi where volatil were low and spread were low   so yes  there has been this    dichotomi  and peopl talk about it   there   s a certain amount of frustrat about it as well  i think  becaus it  sn   t make sens in term of most peopl   s mental model of how these thing work
yes   a coupl of peopl i talk to in the invest world character the situat as a sort of tight equilibrium that was balanc off against risk on both side   they approach it with a sens of uneas becaus they view it as not necessarili stabl
ani further comment or question   if not  would somebodi like to move to ratifi the domest open market oper  speaker      so move
without object  they are approv   we move on to dave
thank you  mr  chairman   in brief  the news that we have receiv sinc the complet of the novemb  book five week ago has been support of the view that the economi has been grow modest abov trend and will like continu to do so into next year   inde  both the incom data on econom activ and some of the key factor that condit the project point to a more favor outlook than was anticip in our previous project   a pickup in the pace of hire and stronger growth of consumpt led us to mark up the project pace of real gdp growth in the second half of this year by   percentag point  to    percent at an annual rate   sinc the public of last week   s  book  we receiv stronger than expect read on retail sale and wholesal inventori and weaker than expect figur on intern trade   on net  these data appear to be about a wash for current quarter gdp   look beyond the near term  higher equiti valu  larger gain in hous price  a lower exchang valu of the dollar  and a drop in oil price suggest greater upward impetus to spend and activ over the next two year   in fact  incorpor this more favor configur of financi and oil market develop into our project would have result in output overshoot potenti   in order to forestal that outcom  we rais the trajectori of the assum feder fund rate  and we are now just slight below the path impli by futur price   i suppos that if i were truli in the holiday spirit i would give you a gift by stop right here  becaus that is pretti much the stori behind the forecast   but season adjust  i   m not feel ani more generous than usual      so let me start with the labor market   the octob and novemb employ report did not provok in us the same euphoria follow by disappoint that was appar in the reaction of financi market   taken togeth  the employ increas in octob and novemb were notic stronger than had been incorpor in the previous  book and allay our concern that weak in the labor market might sap the vigor of the expans   as i note at the last meet  our novemb project had put under gain in privat payrol in the second half of this year at around         per month   but it now look as if hire has been run around         per month  and we expect it to pick up to around         per month by the spring   most other read on the labor market also point to a gradual improv   the onli discord note has been the increas in initi claim over the past two week   we are not yet inclin to read much into that increas  but it   highlight downsid risk to the employ outlook   consum spend also surpris us to the upsid   in respons to the incom news  we rais the project growth of real pce by    percentag point in the second half of this year  and ye day= retail sale releas suggest a further small upward adjust of a few tenth to our fourth quarter consumpt forecast   we are now es  that real pce advanc at an annual rate of more than   percent in the third quarter and will increas at a     percent pace in the current quarter   that slowdown is more than account for by a drop off in motor vehicl sale in octob and novemb   with inventori remain uncomfort high  we are expect that the automak will be forc in come month to adopt a combin of some cutback in product from current schedul and sweeten incent to boost sale  outsid motor vehicl  real pce is now project to grow at a    percent annual rate in the current quarter  a bit fa  than in the third quarter   the anecdot about the holiday sell season have been mix to downbeat in recent week   i don   t think that we have ever been veri success in match holiday anecdot to the publish data   still  we   ve assum a weak decemb for retail sale  in part on the basi of these stori and the dropback in week chain store sale   in the busi sector  outlay for capit equip have continu to increas steepli  with real e s up about    percent at an annual rate in the third quarter and project to increas    percent in the fourth quarter   taken togeth  those gain were close to our earlier expect   in look at our e s forecast  it is clear that we are approach someth akin to a    moment of truth      a few year back  base on calibr theoret model and a healthi dose of judgment  we built into our forecast of equip spend a notic effect from partial expens   that effect includ a boost to spend dure the period when partial expens was permit  follow by a pothol after it expir   gee  it seem pretti logic at the  e   and even now  there is evid to support our posit   real spend on equip has exceed the expect of our econometr model that make no allow for partial expens   and by an amount close to that of our es  of the expens effect   moreov  new order for capit good fell off in octob and fell a bit more than is necessari to creat our first quarter dip in spend   and while the anecdot have been underwhelm  we   ve alway recogn that onli a small    fraction of firm would be on a margin where this provis actual influenc their spend decis   but all that said  it just  sn   t feel as if the risk are symmetr around this aspect of our project   the probabl that the effect will turn out to have been smaller than that incorpor in our project seem larger to me than the probabl that this effect will exceed our expect   part of my discomfort aris from the recognit that  if we had start out our forecast with a null hypothesi that partial expens would have no effect on spend  i could easili imagin myself sit here today argu that the data and anecdot had not contradict that hypothesi either   i don   t want to exagger the vulner of our gdp project to this assumpt   in fact  we have offset about two third of the tax induc swing in equip spend in inventori and import so that domest product of capit good is much less affect than spend   still  if the partial expens effect turn out to be smaller than we have es  and under demand for equip correspond stronger  the economi is like to carri somewhat greater momentum into earli next year than is implicit in our forecast   while cross one   s finger is not a forecast methodolog typic cover in graduat level econometr  that is what we will be do over the next few month    laughter   of cours  the momentum that the economi carri forward into next year will be affect to a much greater extent by the broader develop in the econom and financi environ than by the effect of partial expens   and on that score  the key factor condit our project have strengthen notic over the past five week   as you know  one of the key upsid risk we saw to the project was the possibl that the accommod stanc of monetari polici would be accompani by sharper movement in asset market than we were forecast  some of those risk may have manifest themselv of late  at least to some degre  the stock market is about   percent higher than in our previous project  hous price are project to averag about   percent higher  the price of import crude oil is about    per barrel lower  on averag  in      and about    per barrel lower in       and although the dollar has retrac some of it earlier declin  by the  e we close the  book last wednesday  it was still below our previous project   the increas in household net worth associ with higher price for equiti and hous provid a consider boost to household spend over the project period  as   the increas in real incom stem from the lower price of oil   meanwhil  the weaker dollar is project to give a lift to export and to trim the growth of import   the onli notabl factor on the negat side of the ledger was the further downward revis that we made to our forecast of spend on high tech equip  while the news was not uniform downbeat  enough of it was negat to make us take anoth hard look at our forecast   with relat price for tech equip not declin at the pace they had a few year back  with few sign of new applic that would substanti s ul demand  and with domest and foreign produc report cautious about the outlook  we lower our project of the growth of real    high tech equip spend   we now project that the growth of spend on this equip will equal  rather than exceed  it histor averag go forward   we believ that this outlook better balanc the risk   on net  the posit for the econom outlook signific outweigh the negat and  as i note earlier  without an adjust to our polici assumpt would have result in actual real gdp overshoot potenti by the end of the project period   as a consequ  we rais our path for the fund rate    basi point  bring the assum level to    percent by the end of next year and to    percent by the end of        our assum path is now just   percentag point  on averag  below that implicit in the fed fund futur market   these adjust alter the contour of our project  with fa  growth in real gdp now project for next year  follow by a more notic slow of growth in      as the less accommod stanc of polici show through   the inflat pictur has chang littl over the intermeet period   our forecast for core cpi in octob was right on the mark  as was our forecast for core pce  moreov  there have been onli modest chang in the key determin of inflat  the larger than expect drop in the price of oil is part offset by the higher price for non oil import   in our forecast  total pce inflat is still expect to reced from     percent this year to about    percent in      and       while core pce inflat remain rough unchang at     percent over the next two year   as in the previous forecast  that stabil in core inflat is brought about by sever small offset effect   a diminish margin of slack and some slow of structur product are expect to place slight upward pressur on inflat   but these effect are offset by some revers of this year   s jump in energi price and a smaller project rise in non oil import price   at the last meet  vice chairman   ask  in effect  whether the benign outlook for inflat in our baselin and even in our altern simul reflect a lack of imagin on our part or  perhap the unstat altern  a lack of intellig    laughter   i was at least grate to implicit be offer a choic   you know  cigarett or blindfold   in the end  i   m not certain that we can offer the vice chairman much comfort on the intellig front   but we did attempt to exercis our imagin better  and it is fair to say that  in survey the landscap  some upsid risk to inflat strike us as potenti more potent than other   one risk is that econom growth will exceed our expect  caus resourc util to tighten more quick than in the baselin project   while that outcom certain cannot be rule out  we don   t see the implic for inflat as be especi larg  at least over the two year  e frame of our project   as we have highlight in the past  inflat simpli is not veri sensit to the output gap in our model  the effect is not zero  but it is nonetheless small   moreov  a corollari to this observ is that  if we have mis es  the natur rate of unemploy or the output gap  we don=t think the consequ for inflat would be larg over    the next eight quarter   again becaus inflat   not appear to be especi sensit to resourc util   anoth risk might be that the upward pressur on inflat from rise commod and materi price will intensifi in the come year   oil price have certain surpris us and particip in futur market this year   moreov  a steeper slide in the dollar or more rapid improv in industri activ here or abroad could produc more signific pressur in commod market   if sharp increas in materi cost were to continu  an increas fraction of firm that to date have absorb these cost may attempt to pass them on to custom   base on quot from futur market  we don   t see a continu of rapid gain in commod price as the most like outcom  and given the small share of cost account for by raw materi  the consequ of an upsid surpris do not loom especi larg  nonetheless  it   seem a risk worth close monitor   in our view  a more promin and sizabl upsid risk to the project is that firm will act more aggress to rais price in order to limit the damag done to their profit margin by slow product and rise unit labor cost   those tendenc could be amplifi if product slow more sharpli than we are project   as you know  we show a simul combin these develop in the  book  and the consequ was an acceler of core pce price to    percent by         percentag point abov the baselin forecast and at the outer edg of our    percent confid interv   we don   t think that the evid favor such an outcom  but we see this as an import vulner in our otherwis sanguin outlook   more broad  we are tri to remain especi alert to develop that would suggest that this year   s price shock will propag forward into higher under inflat   in addit to the possibl of slower growth of labor product  ani sign of a signific pickup in nomin wage would have troubl implic for cost and price   but the broad measur of hour labor compens have been run a veri steadi   percent or so over the past year  with littl indic of an immin takeoff   inflat expect also deserv close scrutini   inflat compens as measur by the five year tip spread has move up in recent month  but five  to ten year inflat compens has bare budg   moreov  survey measur   either short term or long term   have chang littl over the past year   at this junctur  we see still few sign that this year   s upturn in inflat is the begin of a process of more pronounc deterior   obvious  the size of the confid interv surround our forecast admit a reason wide rang of outcom over the next two year  both to the upsid and to the downsid of our inflat project   although we are comfort with our outlook for inflat  we leav it to the committe to decid whether this forecast deserv a holiday turkey or whether it is the holiday turkey     will continu our present
at this  e of year  when person old and young are look for tangibl evid of whether they have been naughti or nice dure the past    twelv month  i cannot resist take joy in point out that some forc  perhap from the north pole  has given the forecast in the intern divis the opportun to say someth that we have been wait to say for a long  e     as we forecast in the previous  book  global oil price have fallen on balanc over the intermeet period       laughter   inde  they have fallen a bit more than we forecast  with the result that our forecast path for u s  oil import price has shift down about    per barrel in      and    per barrel in        one consequ of recent develop is that the futur curv for wti price and our project path for the averag price of import oil are flatter than they have been in the past sever month  with onli a relat small further net chang expect in oil price from now through the end of        at the same  e  uncertainti about futur oil price seem to be quit high   the expect price for wti for the januari contract and the june contract for next year are both around       but the probabl distribut around the mean price for june is veri wide  with the  …  probabl interv rang from     per barrel to     per barrel   with the project path for oil price fair flat  the implic of global oil price for growth and inflat abroad consist main of the futur effect of oil price develop that have alreadi occur   despit their recent declin  oil price remain elev from their level one year ago   we judg that the slow of activ in sever foreign economi in the third quarter is due at least in part to the net increas in oil price this year   the negat effect on output growth were relat greater for the asian emerg market economi  which tend to be more depend on import oil than other region  although these economi have also felt the slowdown in the global high tech sector   over  e  we expect the transitori influenc of the spike in oil price to dissip and averag real gdp growth abroad to return to an annual rate of about    percent   for the industri countri and the emerg market economi  headlin inflat will be up a bit in the near term and then subsequ edg back down  reflect the path of oil price   dure most of the intermeet period  the dollar continu the downward trend that had resum in mid septemb  with the index of major currenc reach a point earli last week that was    percent below it may peak and a nine year low  market particip point to heighten concern about the financ burden of the widen u s  trade deficit as a major factor drive the dollar   s slide   at the  e that we were put the finish touch on the decemb baselin forecast  recent exchang rate move indic that we should lower the path for the real valu of the broad index of the dollar about   percent   howev  subsequ the dollar has signific revers it intermeet move in a sharp appreci   no particular data releas or event seem to have trigger the climb of the dollar   market particip point to incent for trader to take profit and to elimin previous establish short dollar posit ahead of the year end   our baselin decemb forecast incorpor the lower path project for the dollar direct in u s  trade price and volum and  as a consequ  in the outlook for domest activ and inflat in a complex way   of cours  daili fluctuat in    the dollar cannot be anticip and could easili put us back at the decemb  book start level   howev  had we not revis the path for the dollar and so left it unchang from that in the novemb  book  our trade equat suggest that the partial effect of this chang alon would have been to increas the negat contribut of net export to u s  real gdp growth about      percentag point in      and    in      relat to what is current in the decemb  book   with such a higher path for the dollar  import price inflat in the baselin would have been notic lower in the near term but littl chang in        by the fourth quarter of       the partial effect of a higher dollar path would be to widen the project current account deficit about     billion   in addit to the move in oil price and the exchang valu of the dollar  the other major featur of the intern forecast at this  e is that we have again revis down project foreign growth  particular in the near term   as mention earlier  to some degre this reflect the consequ of elev oil price   but it also reflect more fundament shortfal in macroeconom perform in some region   for exampl the euro area  where we have lower our forecast for real gdp growth throughout the forecast period   persist weak in domest demand in the euro area is a vulner that restrain global recoveri and undercut the adjust of u s  extern deficit   weak domest spend in the euro area is associ primarili with germani  one factor that is thought to be at least part respons is the extens discuss of and  at least some progress on  implement of structur reform in the particip countri   for exampl  german pension reform appear to be creat incent for higher save on the part of household  as the prospect of less generous pension or the uncertainti about how the reform system will function increas the perceiv need for privat asset   given the veri larg unfund public liabil associ with social insur system in europ  success reform and higher person save would be help   howev  for those save to be realiz in higher capit stock and improv german output growth  privat invest spend must also be s ul   such a respons might requir some reduct in interest rate  led by eas on the part of the ecb  in order to maintain util of macroeconom resourc dure the implement of reform   action on the part of the ecb is made less like  howev  by the continu record of headlin inflat abov the target ceil of   percent   euro area inflat is    stuck    at   percent in part becaus govern  particular the german govern  are turn to increas in administ price as they seek higher revenu to keep overal budget deficit from rise even further   on balanc  our outlook for the euro area dure the forecast period is slow growth  at about    percent  as the long run posit benefit of the structur reform effort are either yet to arriv or are overwhelm by negat  short run consequ   we have also revis down our project for near term growth in japan  recent releas gdp data and current indic paint a pictur of real gdp expans in japan that is not as strong as we and the market had expect   growth    should rebound from less than    percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year to onli about     percent annual rate dure        this morn  trade data for octob were releas   the trade deficit came in at       billion  up      billion from septemb and notic larger than both we and the market had anticip   the increas in the deficit primarili reflect a surg in merchandis import  export increas onli modest   these data will no doubt lead us to revis down our project for real net export in the current quarter  although we obvious have not had  e to digest fulli the implic for the outlook   a rough  back of the envelop calcul suggest that the contribut of real net export to u s  gdp growth could be revis down enough to bring the negat contribut in the current quarter to around    percentag point   this number should be taken with a grain of salt  howev  as we are reluct to reli too heavili on one month   s worth of volatil data   that conclud our present   dave and i will be happi to answer your question

thank you  mr  chairman   sinc we   re make histori today  the seventh district   s economi continu to firm  and the strength appear broad base   our busi contact again report increas product  strong new order  and grow backlog   labor market condit are improv  although they   re still not robust   our temporari help firm report that order are strong for profession and technic help  but growth is a bit less rapid in the light industri and cleric sector  we recent held our eighteenth annual econom outlook symposium   twenti six economist submit forecast this year  and they were a bit more pessimist than the blue chip forecast   the consensus outlook is for gdp growth of     percent in      and for the cpi to rise        percent next year   not surpris  a number of the particip in the symposium make a live in the auto industri   their outlook for light vehicl sale in      is      million unit  a pace virtual unchang from        if the big three continu to lose market share  this pace would impli declin in their sale  and such declin would be a challeng for our district  given the heavi presenc of big three product   two of our director  who are major part supplier  are work off the assumpt that big three product in the first quarter will be   percent below that of a year ago but said they wouldn   t be surpris if the actual cut were as much as    percent  turn to the nation outlook  on balanc the data we have receiv dure the past few week haven   t materi chang our view about the economi   we continu to expect that growth will averag a bit abov potenti over the forecast period   our best guess is that there is still some meaning resourc slack in the economi  so our outlook for inflat is relat benign  the fact that higher price for energi and other input did not mark boost core inflat is certain consist with this view  with regard to risk  i   m still concern that factor such as high energi price and busi caution could continu to hold back growth in job creation   howev  i   m also concern about some inflat risk   we know that there is a great deal of uncertainti about the size of resourc gap   what if they   re not as larg as we think   after all  we   ve been expect big increas in employ as the gap in labor market shrink   but it has been three year sinc the recess end  and even in the year sinc employ began to head up  payrol have increas onli a bit fa  than the work age popul  and labor forc particip has been flat dure this period  it   s possibl that this is as good as it get   the particip rate simpli may have overshot trend in the late      s by more than we thought and  therefor  the rate may not rise much abov it current level   the answer to this question regard resourc gap is not obvious at this  e  as      mention in his comment   but we cannot rule out the possibl that there is less resourc slack in the economi than we think and that we   ve been read the inflat data with too much complac   whether inflat pick up dure the next eight quarter or after the next eight quarter  either scenario would be of concern   of cours  even if we discount this risk  polici is still high accommod  so at this meet my view is that we should continu on our current cours  it   s still too earli to signal an immin paus  that will be a key question for next year
thank you  mr  chairman   my contact are essenti say that they could just replay the tape from our novemb convers   the situat is not much chang  the outlook remain pretti favor   let me comment particular on some evid on demand in the labor market   when i was talk to my contact at the  e of the last fomc meet  a number of them note the strength of demand in the technic area   both it and account   and demand for mbas   so what i did this  e was to call placement director at two mba program  and i thought those convers gave me some interest insight into what   s go on in that regard   one of the program is what i think we   d call a first tier mba program   the number of compani that came to that campus reach a recent high of     in the fall of        by       the number had drop to       it was     last year and     this year   so there has been a veri substanti increas in the number of compani come to hire   a contact at a second tier program had the same kind of inform  with the number of firm recruit on their campus up    to    percent over last year   particular noteworthi was the fact that consult firm are come back into the market  which hadn   t occur for a good long  e   at the lower skill level  my wal mart contact say that they continu to have load of applic for posit as associ    when they open new store   so i think that the labor market is begin to tighten at the upper skill level  on the overal outlook  i agre with the  book  subject to the usual caveat about standard error   i think it   s import to understand that the expans is not fragil   i think there   s a grow amount of busi confid  forward plan  and mayb even veri earli sign of exuber when you look at the recoveri of ipo and at merger and acquisit activ   and the demand for employe at the higher skill level suggest that compani are realli gear up  with a pretti solid outlook go forward  i do think that the inflat risk are tilt slight to the upsid   i don   t forese an outbreak of inflat  but if we   re go to see a miss there  i think it   s more like to be on the upsid than the downsid   if we view chang in oil price and exchang rate as exogen shock   and certain the  e has to be view as exogen   then we would expect over  e a gradual absorpt of the pressur that are come from them   those effect look pretti pervas  they are spread throughout the economi   i think a better view of what   s go on here is that oil and exchang rate should be regard as fundament endogen variabl and that they reflect an environ of expansionari polici continu over a sustain period of  e   i believ we   re on a good cours to prevent that from get out of hand  but those are two veri  veri import influenc on the price perform of the economi go forward   the pass through occur slowli  but they do occur eventu   therefor  i think we should not relax simpli becaus recent oil price are off their high   the long term oil futur are up about    percent or more from where they were a few year ago   so there has been a veri import fundament chang  i think  in the econom in that market   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the district is expand at a moder strong pace  close mirror that in the nation   hous market remain especi robust  and consum spend at store and on travel is solid   the high volum of intern trade flow through the district has result in backlog at our port in southern california   in addit  there have been some report that firm are face difficulti in get access to enough truck and railroad car   not surpris  ship price have risen  turn to the nation economi  i   ve been hearten by recent econom data  which for the most part have been posit   the novemb employ report was disappoint  but taken in the context of the last sever month of job growth and other data  i have becom more confid that the economi has found solid foot  look forward  the declin in the dollar and the recent retreat in oil price add further support to aggreg demand   even so  it is notabl that output growth so far has onli moder exceed potenti despit huge dose of fiscal and monetari medicin   and the  book  though more upbeat this  e than last  forecast a similar pattern for       even with onli a gradual remov of monetari accommod  turn to inflat  the       book forecast of core pce inflat of about     percent and core cpi inflat of   percent strike me as veri reason   in support of this view  our contact tell us that consum price remain relat stabl   inde  our contact see continu competit pressur to control cost   such pressur were evid in labor negoti at groceri store in southern california earlier this year and more recent at major hotel in the bay area   i see the risk to inflat from uncertainti about the futur path of the dollar and oil price   anoth risk  which i   ve mention befor  relat to the high markup of price over unit labor cost   a revers to more normal level could result in a signific reduct in the rate of inflat     final  what happen to product growth is also import for the inflat outlook  as the  book altern simul demonstr  i would like to focus the remaind of my comment on product and it implic for inflat and monetari polici   as we discuss at the last meet  the recent moder in the pace of price declin for high tech good  coupl with weak in high tech invest last quarter  hint at the possibl of less robust product growth go forward   if this turn out to be the case  we would expect some upward pressur on inflat   i would like to emphas  howev  that there is a real chanc that product growth over the next few year will come in higher than anticip in the  book   over the past four year  labor product growth in the nonfarm busi sector has averag near   percent   about     percentag point abov it pace over            in spite of a sharp drop off in capit deepen after         some peopl argu that improv product growth sinc      is larg temporari and will revers over the next few year   for exampl  the recent surg in product may reflect the fact that busi have been extrem cautious in ad worker   propon of this view expect caution to dissip and product growth to slow as firm becom more confid about the outlook  but if busi caution in make long term commit were the primari motiv for weak job growth  we would expect   but do not see   employ expand along other margin  such as the workweek   one reason for op  about the under product trend is that multifactor product dure the second half of the     s was probabl greater than es  deriv from standard growth account   we now realiz that a consider amount of the invest dure the late     s had a low or even a negat rate of return  bias up standard es  of the contribut to product growth from capit deepen     moreov  all sign suggest that busi are continu to adapt and reorgan their practic in order to take full advantag of the opportun afford by new ict technolog  and this process seem like to continu play out for some  e   for exampl  one of our major bank indic that through ongo use of technolog they have been abl to support growth in custom and servic with fewer staff   a further exampl is the continu expans of wal mart and other big box store   a trend that has had a dramat effect on product growth in the retail and wholesal sector  final  there is evid suggest that the extraordinarili high rate of invest dure the second half of the     s were disrupt to busi   accord to one es   such adjust cost reduc product growth about    percentag point dure that period   all in all  it   s entir possibl that product growth  both structur and actual  could averag around    percent over the next two year  as in an altern  book simul   this pace is about equal to the averag rate of product growth dure the last seven year  includ period of both high and low invest   in the  book simul that combin such a step up in product growth and a declin markup  inflat fall to   percent in the second half of next year and remain at that level   such an outcom is troubl  given our concern about the effect of deflat and difficulti in conduct monetari polici in such an environ  so  in summari  i consid the     percent  book es  of structur product growth as reason and the risk to inflat as balanc   but there is signific upsid product potenti and associ downsid risk to inflat   given the cost of an unexpect and substanti declin in inflat  these risk should be a signific concern   for today   s meet  it seem entir sensibl to rais the fund rate    basi point and to craft a statement that leav our option open to eventu
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the third district continu to expand at a moder pace   report from our manufactur have been most posit   our novemb busi outlook survey  bos  index of general

manufactur sector   the new order and shipment index remain at healthi level  and the employ index continu to strengthen  look beyond our formal survey  retail sale of general merchandis in our region are show continu moder growth this holiday season  at a pace consist with retail    expect   this growth has been in most store type and merchandis line   retail in our region expect current dollar holiday sale this year to be   percent higher than last year  which is similar to the nation retail feder   s forecast of a     percent gain   on the margin  howev  sale of luxuri good continu to show better year over year increas than sale of other item  turn to construct  nonresidenti construct remain soft   we had a bit of an improv last month  but it was fleet   it   s probabl best to describ this sector as have bottom out without ani kind of sustain improv yet   nonetheless  commerci real estat firm expect offic vacanc rate to move down somewhat in the year ahead in most part of the region   at the same  e  they continu to report declin in effect rent  as landlord compet for new tenant and leas renew   as a result  some commerci real estat investor are becom concern that price

they are rais price for new home  in contrast to some other part of the nation where it is report that develop are begin to cut price or offer discount upgrad as incent to spur sale   look ahead  builder and real estat agent expect the pace of sale to remain rough steadi   they anticip rise employ and incom to cushion the effect of increas in mortgag rate as long as the upturn in rate   not

third quarter  but payrol went up in all major industri group except manufactur and inform servic   employ growth in new jersey and delawar continu to outpac that of the nation  pennsylvania continu to exhibit the weakest labor market in our region   look ahead  our staff forecast call for moder acceler in employ growth and a declin in unemploy rate in each of our three state over the next year  on the inflat front  some report suggest increas industri good price pressur   this is what we hear from our board  and this is what busi are report in their comment to us around the district   in our busi outlook survey  the price index remain at high level  and firm report higher price for their own manufactur good and higher product cost   for exampl  more than    percent of the execut poll in our novemb bos expect price of raw materi  includ energi  to increas next year   in all  the outlook among our contact in the region   s busi communiti is posit   they expect growth to continu at about it current pace through the winter     turn to the nation  data releas sinc our last meet have general been on the posit side   household spend and busi invest have been revis upward  suggest posit momentum   recent retail sale number were encourag   hous construct remain relat strong  and manufactur remain on solid foot   while the novemb employ report was a bit on the soft side  the pattern of payrol growth over the past sever month  allow for the usual month volatil of the data  show continu improv in the labor market  payrol growth has averag over         job per month so far this year  about in line with the forecast   while there like is still some slack in labor market  this is be work off   by the way  for those of you who put some valu in the nairu model  the recent staff analysi of nairu es  at our bank suggest that there may be less slack in the labor market than we assum  the other posit develop for aggreg demand sinc the last meet are the declin in oil price and the depreci of the dollar  as we know  my outlook for econom growth is broad consist with that of the  book   i  too  expect growth in the neighborhood of   percent next year  and i   m more comfort with the fed fund rate path built into this  book than i was with the path of the last one   howev  even with the steeper fund rate path  i see somewhat more inflat risk   the dollar could depreci more and the pass through to final price could be larger than is incorpor into the baselin forecast   i do recal that we discuss at our last meet the worldwid phenomenon of a reduct in the pass through rate   nonetheless  i think we need to list this as a risk to our forecast   in this regard  as     note  five year inflat compens base on the treasuri index secur has move up  even while six to ten year inflat compens has been stabl   one interpret of the diverg is that the market believ that the fomc will respond to inflationari pressur and keep price stabl in the long run  but onli after we see that inflat has    risen   i would prefer that we be more forward look than this impli   this  of cours  argu for maintain our strategi of gradual remov polici accommod to bring polici back to a neutral stanc   the fact are that polici remain accommod  the forecast is for continu growth in the neighborhood of   percent  and there is some posit inflat risk   all this suggest to me that it is prudent to continu on our upward path for the fund rate  befor close  i   d like to point out that the bluebook   s measur of the real fed fund rate use lag core pce   by this measur  we have made some progress in move the real fund rate north   howev  ex ant measur of the real rate  base on the forecast of inflat  show less progress by the committe in remov polici accommod   i would ask the committe to rememb        at that  e  the fomc wait to see a year   s worth of strong employ data befor start to rais rate  on the ground that fall inflat meant that the real rate was rise  then onc the fomc start to increas rate  it had to do so quit sharpli over the year   of cours  this  e we began rais rate earlier than last  e  which may allow us to follow a more gradual path   howev  rememb  this  e inflat has been increas  and the real rate has been move up onli a littl   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the meet with our sixth district board of director were particular  e this cycl  just conclud at the end of last week   i would note three issu and impress that came from those discuss  first  the director    general outlook for the economi was decid posit and more solid and broad base than has been the case for some  e   there even seem to be some new stir in commerci real estat   and more of our banker are report some increas in busi lend  especi in small and middl market   i was particular struck by the degre to which much of    the busi caution that remain was attribut by mani to all of the  e and attent be devot to the sarban   oxley govern work   one get the sens that  onc some of the initi adjust to that legisl is behind us  perhap   just perhap   some of the caution we have talk so much about will begin to dissip  second  i was struck by the degre of talk about price increas that had been put in place or were be plan   while some of those were direct attribut to the cost of oil and other energi cost  there was just more widespread convers about the determin to get some price adjust  third  i was intrigu by an oil price observ from one of our new orlean director  who is a senior execut for one of the largest u s  chemic compani   i had been under the impress that less develop countri like china  becaus they are    energi effici disadvantag     would be relat more hurt by the past rise of oil price than the unit state  howev  this director relat that  dure a recent visit to china to discuss a new joint ventur plant to produc an input to the manufactur of plastic good  his staff couldn   t reconcil the financi that were be present   the reason was that the energi price assumpt in those project seem to be unreason low   to make a long stori short  the chines were use oil price that were about     less a barrel than west texa intermedi crude   when queri about this  it seem that the refineri built in develop asia over the last fifteen year were design to process sour crude  which is present trade at a price that is    to     below that of sweet crude   this mean that the area has a temporari  as well as a potenti absolut  energi price advantag   sour crude is not in short suppli   moreov  u s  plant can   t handl it   the stori seem total consist with the discuss in the  book of substanti differ in the price of sour and sweet crude     at the nation level  i find myself character the pace of growth as somewhat more robust than the    moder pace    languag we use in our post fomc statement last  e   with gdp have expand at an averag of more than   percent for the past six quarter and a forecast for more of the same  i think we could be even more posit in describ the path we seem to be on   although we continu to puzzl and even worri about job growth  as toni just note we have averag about         new job a month over the past eleven month   this has been enough to allow the unemploy rate to drift lower over the cours of the year   although continu product gain and a general reluct by busi to hire until absolut necessari suggest that a substanti greater base of new job creation is probabl not like  we should continu to make further gain in work down the unemploy rate unless we have signific chang in the particip rate or in immigr polici  i cannot point to ani alarm develop with respect to inflat  but the anecdot report i just share from across our district suggest a possibl shift in the prospect for widespread price increas  and that give me paus   i   d also note that five to ten year inflat expect  while reason well anchor  have drift up steadili in      and      to near    percent  final  the substanti run up in hous price  which we have follow in florida and also see in the popul northeast and west coast of the unit state  may be at least partial attribut to unusu low mortgag rate influenc by our veri accommod polici  which has been in place for some  e   those develop and the risk associ with the run up in hous price probabl deserv further studi and thought as we decid how to postur polici  i continu to be comfort with the polici path we   re on   and bar some surpris  i judg that we still have a consider way to go to get back to a more neutral stanc   my concern is that  with a real fed fund rate that continu to be near zero  we could unintent be    encourag further imbal in both the inflat environ and in the intern sector   i hope we will not tri to signal that we may soon paus in our remov of polici accommod  thank you  mr  chairman

 surpris   and in what direct will that surpris push econom activ   to increas inflat  slower growth  increas market instabl  or some combin of all of these  i   m have some troubl figur out how to close this    laughter   i do sens increas risk out there   on the other hand  i don   t think there   s ani choic for us at this meet   i think    that the u s  economi is on an upward trajectori and that polici has to come out of it current veri accommod stanc   in effect  as i look at both side of the risk here  i think our move in that direct make the economi intern a littl more resili   it take a bit more think on the part of market to deal with risk in an environ of rise interest rate   and i believ that   s the right way for us to go over the near term  though i do think we need to be cautious about an increas set of risk  both nation and intern   frank  as for what we say  i would like to take it down to as littl as possibl about forward look thing and make it as clean and clear as we possibl can
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to start my comment this morn with a somewhat troubl statist  and that is that the pnc bank   s twelv day of christma price index jump     percent   it has been report that a surg in french hen price more than offset a modest drop in the cost of turtl dove    laughter   if you look at their core index  which i   m told exclud the high volatil swan a swim compon  that index was actual up     percent from a year ago    laughter  with that  i   ll turn to my district report   in my report at our last meet  i note that busi activ in the fourth district did not seem repres of what we   ve been hear at the nation level   and judg by the most recent beig book  my region still seem to be more econom challeng than the rest of the nation   dure the intermeet period  i spent a signific amount of  e talk to member of the busi communiti   and from my convers  i sens a continu disconnect between the strong growth report that i   m get  especi from the larger intern manufactur  and the continu soggi perform of our district   s labor market   compani report that a lot of growth in order and product is take    place   it just isn   t alway be met with much job growth  and inde  the activ itself isn   t alway occur in the fourth district   firm that report ampl capac are see some squeez in profit margin as they are abl onli to partial pass along some of their rise cost to custom  other have been abl to maintain their profit by find yet more way to absorb the cost pressur through product enhanc   and some busi that are feel capac constraint  includ the steel produc and the capit good maker  say they are actual success pass cost pressur up the product line  but where i might ordinarili hear that these firm that are at capac are gear up to expand their local product capabl  what i   m now common hear are stori that these firm are choos instead to expand their product capac abroad  especi in southeast asia and china   one interpret of this inform is that some industri are still in the midst of a rather wrench and like protract structur chang  and the fourth district is as close to ground zero in that transform as one can get   it may take a long  e yet befor we see sustain signific employ gain in our area   and while this global realign is under way  i think it might be more challeng than usual to accur judg capac util and inflationari break point  if i   ve been follow the past sever  book correct  the staff has had to put more monetari restraint into it project to hold the inflat rate steadi  becaus over the next two year it now seem that aggreg demand is grow somewhat fa  and cyclic product is grow somewhat slower than previous   i found the altern scenario about product growth and cost pass through to be veri inform as i thought about the risk to the outlook  each of these variabl  of cours  is veri difficult to predict   i am more op ist than the baselin  book project about product becaus of the comment i   ve been hear from my    busi contact   but i am also hear from my busi contact that they are have greater success in pass cost along to their custom   these forc  of cours  have offset implic for the inflat outlook  and they do bear close scrutini in the month ahead  we have been remov our polici accommod at a gradual and steadi pace   as we   ve done so  i have becom more satisfi about the balanc of risk to our goal   clear  there are uncertainti about how the econom situat is evolv  and my prefer in this environ is to avoid the risk of unexpect increas in inflat   i am fair confid that the economi is go to continu to expand at a pace that   s consist with a rise equilibrium real rate over  e  and i think it   s a good idea for peopl to expect that environ until we see strong evid to the contrari   so i think that today we should take the step that the market anticip  and i would also make as few chang as possibl to our statement   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  let me start briefli with my reaction to the nation economi where i think  as discuss in the  book  growth remain abov trend and  bar unexpect event  is like to remain abov trend for the next coupl of year   if this is correct  we will gradual approach our long run potenti gdp   more specif  we expect that growth will be near but slight below   percent this year and next   with trend growth of about    percent  we es  that we approach potenti at the rate of about   percentag point per year   this outlook is similar  as i said  to the  book and to the decemb blue chip consensus forecast as well  sever factor obvious contribut to this  they   ve been mention  and i   ll onli touch on them   they includ our continu accommod monetari polici  strong consum spend that seem to be continu  and labor market that are in better shape than we thought      notwithstand  as some have comment  the recent claim number   moreov  wealth is higher  as reflect in the stock market and hous price   and  of cours  oil price have declin  i think the evid from our district support this outlook   head into thanksgiv  retail were general op ist about the holiday shop season   almost all of the mall manag we contact just last week said the holiday season had gotten off to a good  though not spectacular  start  with traffic and sale up sever percentag point from a year ago   travel and tourism activ have also been veri solid  and rocki mountain resort owner expect a big increas in foreign ski visit this winter due to the lower dollar   in addit  manufactur firm remain quit op ist about futur activ and plan moder increas in capit spend and employ dure the first half of next year  let me briefli mention our agricultur economi  which will enjoy a record break year in        farm incom is    percent abov last year   s record high and    percent abov previous      es    with histor high livestock price  the bulk of the incom gain have come from that sector   in addit  crop product for corn  soybean  wheat  and so forth  was up    to    percent this year  with corn and soybean produc post record year   even with these larg suppli  price remain well abov their ten year averag   this record farm incom has translat into higher land valu   in the tenth district  ranch land valu have soar    percent abov level of a year ago   non irrig cropland valu are up   percent from a year ago  and irrig cropland valu are up   percent   as a result  equip sale are also surg   for exampl  in octob  sale of larg equip rang anywher from    to    percent abov year ago level  final  analyst expect equip sale to increas in decemb  as farmer and rancher take advantag of purchas to cut their tax bill     turn to the inflat outlook  inflat remain modest  although there are some sign that it may be rise  as other have note   core pce inflat is     percent over the most recent twelv month period  and core cpi inflat is   percent   we have seen some increas in core inflat over the last coupl of month   in addit  as other have note  even though five  to ten year inflat compens remain relat stabl  five year inflat compens has increas   final  while oil price have decreas   a posit   the dollar continu on balanc to depreci   district manufactur continu to expect upward pressur on produc price   for the twelfth month in a row  a net posit percentag of firm rais output price  this follow three straight year of constant or fall output price   in addit  the futur finish good price index rose to it second highest read on record in novemb  trail onli the peak of april       with sluggish employ growth and increas layoff  wage pressur do remain slight  these result  on balanc  suggest to me at least that we should continu steadili move the feder fund rate closer to what we might consid a long run neutral level   in addit  i would submit that the risk of higher inflat than in the  book baselin is larg enough that we should be think about continu to rais rate on a systemat basi   and by more than assum in the  book   first  the  book forecast that the output gap will be elimin by the end of      and that core pce inflat will be     percent or just under that  and yet the real fed fund rate is onli      percent   sinc this is below the board staff   s medium run equilibrium fed fund rate   what i   ll call neutral   we should expect higher inflat begin in        second  we know that all forecast have error band  and the  book provid enough inform that we can calcul the probabl that the output gap is elimin in      or earli        i would submit that the probabl is larg enough that we should be concern about higher inflat in these year   and third  the feder fund rate remain below neutral for the entir forecast period   my    point is that the output gap is be elimin and  when this occur  the risk of inflat  of cours  rise  therefor  i think we should be move the feder fund rate at a fair steadi pace toward the lower bound at least of es  of neutral   bar ani shock  of cours   onc we get close to what most consid the lower bound of neutral  we can becom more cautious at that point and begin to speak of paus   i   d submit  howev  that we are not yet at that point and that we should not becom over cautious at this  e   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the fifth district economi continu to expand at a moder pace in recent week   our servic firm report solid growth in revenu over the last two month  while retail told us that sale have been flat   in particular  big ticket sale remain weak  and car sale are said to be soft  district manufactur report that growth in shipment and new order have tail off over the last month   shipment were basic flat in novemb   although build permit were off the pace of a year ago  hous market remain general strong in our district   in labor market  our inform indic job gain in servic and retail but virtual unchang manufactur employ in novemb   price increas at district firm have trend higher  though they are general remain under   percent  accord to our contact   there was a notabl chang in the tone in manufactur firm regard price  howev   they are now increas say that they can pass through price increas to their custom  unlik earlier in the year when they said price increas were more difficult to pass along  turn to the nation pictur  data receiv in recent week also indic that econom recoveri has continu at a reason healthi pace   consum spend has advanc at a pretti    solid trend rate in recent month  capit spend has been fair brisk  and hous keep come in on the strong side   everi pass month of growth at this pace rais my confid in the stay power of the expans   the  book expect real gdp to expand around     to   percent through       and the output gap is expect to close gradual by then  with pce inflat remain stabl around     percent   this is a relat attract outlook  and it   s one i   m comfort subscrib to  i was particular reliev to see the elimin of the disconnect that was in the novemb  book between the staff   s project and market expect regard the futur path of the feder fund rate   sinc the novemb meet  that disconnect has been resolv through an increas of about    percentag point in the  book   s project rate path  put it onli a littl below market expect of the futur fund rate   this was a favor way of close the gap  sinc it was accompani by an upward revis in expect growth in the  book and reflect more confid in the strength of the recoveri go forward  anoth disconnect remain  howev  that eventu must be resolv   the  book see cpi inflat level off at about    percent in       and yet the  book also report survey es  of ten year ahead expect cpi inflat in the     to   percent rang   moreov  the bluebook report expect measur of between     and   percent base on inflat index treasuri spread   so it seem that a rang of measur are tell us that inflat will be notic greater than we think it will be   this inflat disconnect will be resolv eventu one way or anoth  as i said   we may get lucki and see market expect drift down to a level consist with    percent on the cpi  or we may not be so lucki  one interpret of the persist of inflat expect at these level is that the public believ that our long run toler rang for cpi inflat extend up to   percent or more     if that   s the case  it may be difficult for us to resist an upward drift in inflat as the economi recov   moreov  we can   t be sure that expect inflat won   t drift up still further  if actual inflat begin to drift up   but if we   re unwil to toler cpi inflat near   percent  then we may need to maintain tighter monetari polici than otherwis to ensur that the disconnect between the public   s expect of inflat and our is resolv in our favor   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   comment from director and from a wide rang of contact indic further improv in the district economi   inde some acceler recent   and the improv is quit broad base   given that  let me just comment on a coupl of develop that seem particular relev   there have been in the district sustain  albeit moder  gain in employ for better than a year now   hire plan are posit  accord to our most recent survey  and some skill are now in short suppli   the invest outlook appear to have improv recent   some project that were on the back burner  accord to busi contact  have now been move forward   in general  i think businessmen are feel a bit more upbeat  and that is fuel some enthusiasm for further invest   the final point i would mention about the district economi is that  despit tighten labor market  wage increas remain subdu   general in the   to   percent rang   and price pressur are modest as well  as far as the nation economi is concern  i think it   s perhap at least worth note that the current expans is now into it fourth year  and recent at least thing have been turn out pretti much as we expect   now  that might be a reason to worri  but i prefer to look on the bright side of that   i agre with a point that dave   mention   that the fundament support further econom growth from here forward are distinct posit   if i were write down a gdp    forecast at the moment  i might write down someth a littl stronger than the  book forecast for both      and       on the inflat side  i do expect inflat to remain low  but i must admit that i   m a littl less confid about that than i was a few month ago   if i ask myself whi  i think it has most to do with the dollar   it   s not so much that i   m concern about the pass through  narrowli defin  it   s realli more a concern about the chang natur of the competit environ impli by the declin dollar   and that give me a bit of paus as i contempl inflat prospect   but i think that   s a pretti slim reed to hang all that much on  so i person would stick with a low inflat forecast for now  have said all that  it seem to me that the polici cours is pretti clear here   we should continu with the polici path that we   ve been on   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   i   m overwhelm  as alway  by the intellig and imagin of the staff   laughter  and i don   t have too much to add  our view of the outlook hasn   t chang much sinc our last meet  and we   re veri close to the  book on most dimens of the forecast   the sen ent in new york seem to have becom    a bit more posit over the last few month   our forthcom empir survey for decemb has veri strong read and show a veri substanti improv in most measur   order  shipment  employ  and general condit  nation  we see more momentum in demand growth go into the new year   the main fundament of an expans at slight abov trend growth seem intact   global demand growth is a littl softer but still pretti good   our forecast for real gdp growth remain between     and   percent for       and        with core pce in the neighborhood of     percent  with a path for monetari polici close to that now reflect in the market   we see the risk as rough balanc around this forecast  with a bit less downsid risk to growth and somewhat greater probabl of a higher inflat outcom than we thought a few month ago  we   re at least one quarter and perhap two quarter now into a differ constel of factor affect inflat fundament   product growth slow signific  unit labor cost rise at a rate perhap slight abov that of core pce  and margin start to come in a bit   even allow for the normal fog that surround these judgment  this constel of factor seem like to continu over at least part of the forecast period   this transit come on top of an environ with signific other cost pressur in the pipelin  a declin dollar  a smaller output gap   with the gap perhap now within the margin of error   and demand growth  as i said  slight abov trend  inflat expect are stick at a level somewhat abov what we consid comfort or consist with our implicit inflat target  even though they have come off a bit sinc our last meet   so in this context  i think the overal stanc of monetari polici should continu to be direct at move the real fed fund rate higher  with a signific posit slope to the path of the fed fund rate for the forecast period   i don   t see a compel reason to seek to alter the market   s    expect today for the near term path of the fund rate   this suggest a signal today that is neutral to present market expect  which i think impli veri littl chang to the structur or content of our statement  now  would leav market expect unchang today risk leav the stanc of monetari polici too tight and jeopard the expans   i think that seem unlik   might we end up have to move further and fa  in       than is now price into the futur path   possibl   on balanc  i think the probabl that we will end up move along a path that is slight steeper than is now price in seem to exceed the probabl that we   d move on a path that is softer than what is now price in   but we don   t face that choic today   i think the best way of avoid a more damag adjust to balanc sheet or a more damag adjust to the overal economi  as we move on this path to equilibrium  is to continu to make sure we move far enough fast enough that we don   t rais the risk that we end up have to catch up and move more abrupt in respons to a rise in expect   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   as the  book note  the news on actual and prospect demand sinc the last meet has been most on the posit side   consumpt has proven surpris  at least to me  resili to higher energi price  support by rise hous and equiti wealth and continu low intermedi  and long term interest rate   the higher level of wealth and lower energi price should bol  growth go forward   absent a sharp move in the dollar  longer term interest rate  wealth  or oil price  i don   t see ani forc that are like to shift recent demand pattern enough to throw econom activ off a track that   s about in line with the staff forecast   that is  a gradual further eros of slack as the feder fund rate rise on a trajectori similar to that expect by the market     i think the more difficult question that mani of us have been address at this meet is what the inflat outlook would be that might accompani such an output path   as solid growth becom more entrench and the output gap narrow  the locus of our concern natur tend to shift away from support growth and  other thing be equal  the balanc of risk around stabl inflat move in the direct of fa  price increas   among the other thing that aren   t equal  howev  is monetari polici   in effect  our polici tighten  both actual and expect  is design to keep inflat down and those inflat risk balanc   and in my view  so far the odd favor our success with a measur pace of tighten  concern about higher inflat seem to be base import on pipelin pressur  as reflect in more rapid increas in ppis at various level of product  on the effect of the lower dollar on import price  and on the possibl of slower trend product growth  as well as on the most recent coupl of month of core cpi data   howev  staff brief ye day and a few month ago show just how littl of the pipelin pressur and dollar depreci tend to pass through to core consum price   there   s a lot of uncertainti about structur product  as sever of us have mention   we   ve had onli one quarter of slower product growth after about half a dozen quarter of growth abov the presum trend   and even a coupl of quarter of slowdown in product growth would tell us veri littl about under trend  especi if  as the staff believ  the level of product is abov the long run trend  moreov  a number of influenc are weigh on the side of hold inflat down  and some of these have receiv addit support in recent month   increas in nomin wage and compens have remain moder despit the strength in product growth in recent year and despit higher headlin inflat of late   to my mind  this tend to confirm that there is  inde  slack in labor market   markup of price over unit labor cost have stay quit high through the    third quarter   near record level for nonfarm busi   and these markup would be expect to absorb the initi cost effect of a slowdown in trend product should that occur  give us  e to react to oncom cost pressur   and measur of long term inflat expect have remain remark stabl  i don   t want to sound complac here   there are upsid risk  but i believ if they do end up predomin  we will have  e to react befor inflat rise materi   and in my view they are balanc on the other side  so long as the evid continu to support the exist of slack that is disappear onli gradual and so long as long term inflat expect remain anchor  moreov  i don   t see the cost of miss to one side or the other of stabl inflat as be especi skew  given the current level of inflat   that is  i would not see   or     percent core pce inflat as a substanti wors outcom than   or    percent on core pce inflat   of cours  one   s evalu of implic of the two possibl would depend critic on how they came about   the role of demand and product   but  in general  i would have at least as much confid in our abil to truncat rise pce inflat at   percent as in our abil to stop fall inflat at   percent  one risk i neglect that governor   highlight last meet   and it has play an import role in our collect fret about the current account   is that of a substanti fall in the dollar that is much larger than assum in the staff forecast   sure  this is an asymmetr and nontrivi risk that at some point could well put signific upward pressur on price   i   d be veri cautious  howev  about lean on the tighter side in anticip of such a develop   first  the roller coa  dollar action over the intermeet period was a nice illustr of the futil of tri to predict the  e and dimens of ani foreign exchang movement   second  the appropri polici respons to a drop in the dollar will depend on the respons of other asset    price   the extent to which bond and stock price also react to the taper off in demand for dollar asset   and third  the dollar isn   t the onli asset that risk a price correct  and some of the other candid would call for a polici respons in an eas direct  recent gain in hous price have been astonish   visit banker have told us that invest demand is play an increas role in this market  and while slower increas may be the most like outcom  sure by this point there is a much fatter tail on the side of a consider soft or even declin in such price   in such a situat  save rate might increas sharpli  i also find the recent behavior of bond yield hard to understand   while this committe has becom increas confid of the vigor of the expans over recent month  long term yield have actual declin  and most of this decreas is account for by the decreas in real rate   for a while  this movement seem to reflect the expect that higher oil price would sap demand and flatten the trajectori of our tighten  but the soft in yield has persist over the last intermeet period even as oil price and the dollar fell   i don   t believ this declin repres expect of central bank buy  it   s just too widespread across instrument   a backup in bond rate in respons to unexpect strength in activ or price would play an import stabil role  but i see a nontrivi risk that someth els will trigger a reassess by market and a notic upward movement in real rate that could damp the expans  final  given these crosscurr and uncertainti  i remain convinc that our best approach to asset price concern is to react  possibl aggress  to the combin of asset price movement as it occur   such a strategi can be reason success in counteract the effect of even a larg movement in asset price  and it avoid make polici error by act in anticip of asset price chang that don   t occur or are quit delay     the net of all this is that i would remain on the measur path of polici tighten we   ve been follow   at the last meet  i was concern that we would soon need to prepar the market for step off the    tighten at everi meet    treadmil   in light of the strength in demand and overal eas of financi condit over the intermeet period  howev  i no longer believ that such prepar need begin with the announc for this meet   but given my assess of inflat risk  i also don   t think we should be plan on move up fa  than the market anticip  which   have us take a break from  e to  e   how to signal this flexibl in the announc remain a problem  but a problem for a futur meet   thank you  mr

thank you  mr  chairman   the incom data have provid suffici reason for the staff to rais the baselin forecast   real consum spend  exclud motor vehicl  has increas at a solid pace of late  and ye day

discount all the risk   for much of this fall  i have been particular worri about both the pace of    technolog chang and the actual amount of slack in the labor market  with the relat implic for product growth and inflationari pressur   as dave indic in his open remark  the staff has captur this rang of concern in a scenario entitl    greater cost pass through with lower structur product      give some credibl to the scenario  i note  as dave did  that the staff has mark down the forecast for growth in real high tech invest to onli about it         averag   this downshift in the forecast is reinforc by the current order survey indic that two major manufactur of product enhanc equip character recent increas in order as fall well below expect   at    percent  the percentag of nfib survey respond plan to make capit expenditur is near the low end of it ten year rang  i   ve also heard from a privat sector contact of my own of a sudden weak in demand for cut edg autom machin tool   this contact has an    percent market share for a key compon that is use in near all autom machin tool  and he has experienc an unpreced    percent cancel for deliveri of that critic part in q  of next year and is expect soft through almost all of        final  i believ that the slow in japan and emerg asia  as i think   suggest  is indic of the slowdown in the product improv high tech sector  just as we may be experienc a slow in capit deepen  unit labor cost in the nonfarm busi sector experienc a pickup in the most recent four quarter period  after have put in sever success four quarter declin   addit  the data show quarter over quarter increas in unit labor cost of     percent in q  of this year and     percent in q   both at an annual rate  market signal  as well  may be consist with some worri about both a pickup in inflat and a moder in product growth   two develop may be noteworthi in this regard     first  for reason that we do not fulli understand  while longer term inflat expect are well contain  inflat compens over the next five year has move up notic sinc it low point in        some of that is an unwind of the disinfl concern of        howev  the level of inflat compens for the next five year  at     percent  has alreadi equal or slight exceed it level of      and       when we were concern about inflat risk   given the limit role of foreign buy in the tip market compar with the nomin market  the five year tip is probabl a relat pure measur of domest expect for inflat compens  the other interest phenomenon for the market is the flatten of the yield curv   while the level of rate is also general lower than in the period between      and       as dino indic in the open remark  the two  to ten year nomin spread has fallen from around     basi point to around     basi point now  which is the lowest level in three year   the more steepli slope earlier curv indic bad  e lead to good  e   the flatten of the slope recent might indic okay  e lead to okay  e  which is basic a continu of growth at or around trend   but the fact that the level of the rate is lower  as i think don was impli  might indic that the expect trend growth in the economi is also lower  now  i put all this togeth to conclud that the baselin forecast is a reason basi for policymak today   incom data and the chang forecast  as well as market expect  all seem to suggest that we should continu to move polici from it current accommod stanc at the previous announc measur pace   in addit  condit are not so dramat differ from the last meet that they warrant a major chang in our statement        in her remark  gave a veri reason explan of whi it is that product growth might  in fact  increas  with a particular focus on multifactor product and some risk to inflat on the downsid   howev  base on my read  i also still put some weight on the slowdown in capit    invest and capit deepen  which suggest that we should be vigil to the risk of slower product growth  higher unit labor cost  and a higher pass through   the data and the market both seem to support that prudenc   recogn the uncertainti around this general topic but also the import that growth or a slow of growth in product might play  i   m sure we will return to this discuss again in        thank you
whi don   t we break for coffe at this  e   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   overal  the intermeet data suggest a pickup in the pace of the expans in output and employ  with fewer downsid risk to growth   inflat risk have also move slight to the upsid  i think  but fall oil price help to make ani realli signific increas in inflat unlik   i don   t think the shift in the outlook warrant a chang in the balanc of risk  at least not at this meet  but for me these develop clinch the case for continu our polici of reduc accommod at a measur pace  i   d like to add a few comment on the current account and the dollar   an import question for monetari polici is how long the current configur   the larg current account deficit and relat slow adjust of the dollar and real interest rate   can persist   if this configur were the result of cyclic forc or other short term factor like currenc manipul  then the expect half life of the adjust process might be short   howev  i think the u s  extern deficit is larg a secular phenomenon which  consequ  is like to evolv relat slowli  the key factor under the u s  extern deficit  in my view  is excess global save  advanc industri nation with age popul  notabl japan and we n europ  need to save for demograph reason   absent suffici invest opportun at home  they can do this    onli by run current account surplus   ideal  the save of these matur industri economi would fund invest in develop and emerg market economi   howev  in part becaus of the financi crise of the     s  emerg market economi are either unabl or unwil to accept larg capit inflow  result in an econom pervers situat in which countri like korea  brazil  and argentina have becom signific export rather than import of financi capit   the unit state is the recipi of massiv save inflow becaus  to a first approxim  global save have nowher els to go   as neither the demograph factor drive save in matur industri economi nor the inabl of emerg market to absorb larg capit inflow is like to chang soon  these inflow are like to persist  is the situat sustain   i think it can be sustain for some year  though  e   not permit me to serious address that issu today   it is worth observ  howev  that contrari to the percept that the u s  current account is be driven by an unsustain consumpt bing  american are not consum beyond their mean   as a result of rise stock and hous price  over the past year u s  net nation wealth   that is  net both of foreign borrow and of government save   has increas about      trillion  or around    percent of gdp   that   s a number which  incident  goe some way toward explain the continu strength of consumpt spend   if there is a causal relationship between the current account deficit and u s  consumpt  it   s princip from the former to the latter  as larg save inflow have lower real rate and thus rais asset valu in the unit state  i draw two somewhat contradictori conclus for monetari polici   first  it   s quit possibl   even like   that a u s  current account adjust will play out gradual over a number of year   the staff   s assumpt of a slowli depreci dollar is  therefor  the right one for our plan purpos   we should not attempt to forecast swing in the dollar or base our polici    on a presumpt that a rapid depreci is like in the near term   let   s see what the dollar   and then respond as necessari to fulfil our mandat  howev  while a slow unwind of the current account deficit and relat gradual adjust of the dollar may be the most like outcom  in a world of herd and momentum trade  financi accid can happen   a panicki flight from the dollar  whether justifi in some fundament sens or not  would be veri harm   henc  my second  and i should emphas  veri tentat conclus   when face a close balanc polici decis  we are probabl better off er slight on the side of tight rather than on the side of eas   a higher rate make short term dollar asset more attract and rais the cost of short the currenc  lower the risk of a sudden depreci   all els be equal  a veri slight bias toward a higher fund rate may thus provid a bit of insur against a financi accid in the foreign exchang market   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been much discuss late of our measur pace   are we slavish rais the fund rate    point per meet or follow some other strategi   frank  it is hard to think about this question without know where we are ul  go   mani seem to feel that our ul  target is the equilibrium fund rate  but whether we use a three year or seven year horizon  or some other construct  this equilibrium is onli a measur  not a polici goal   we could rais rate to equilibrium  beyond it  or short of it   the answer depend on econom consider   so let me tri to analyz our rate strategi in term of these econom consider  focus  just as governor bernank did  on global econom over a slight longer period than we usual consid  my goal is to rebal the world economi  ul  stabil u s  intern debt to gdp ratio while preserv price stabil and at least proxim full employ around the    globe   a more ambiti goal might be to let capit on net start to flow away from the unit state and more toward the emerg market world  but such a goal is too ambiti even to think about now   governor bernank  i think  would say    unwis    even to think about now   for now  i just want to limit the inflow ul  to the unit state to a pace that is like to be sustain in the long run   a necessari part of this rebalanc is that the dollar has to fall enough to ul  elimin the u s  trade deficit  the condit for stabil debt to gdp ratio   i   m not talk about ani of the preemptiv strategi discuss in the intern financ memo   i think the memo is right that these are unlik to work   i am talk about how monetari and fiscal polici should act to facilit this rebalanc while  as said abov  preserv price stabil and proxim full employ   it is harder than one would think to accomplish this rebalanc becaus american seem to be chronic overspend while the rest of the world seem to be chronic underspend  and i think this would be true even apart from demograph  the most straightforward part of the plan involv europ   european economi are alreadi oper at less than full employ  and their employ problem onli worsen if their currenc rise   they just have to s ul their economi by some combin of monetari and fiscal polici   if that involv modifi the stabil and growth pact or the normal modus operandi of the ecb  so be it   one would normal think that structur polici would be a neutral to a negat as demand s ul  in line with that anecdot that   told us this morn  but it   s possibl that european law are so rigid that structur polici may boost demand as well  asia is more complic   first off  the asian economi should let the normal adjust process work by permit their currenc to appreci   if they don   t  they will just continu in this like unsustain situat with the ul  adjust probabl becom even more cost   if they do let the adjust process work  japan will definit have to s ul demand     not be awar of a way to set interest rate below zero  this probabl mean fiscal s ul  presum a tax cut   i realiz that japan   s debt to gdp ratio is larg and rise sharpli  but that   s happen anyway   it seem to me that japan should let the equilibr process work and at least tri to find some way other than by export to s ul domest spend   other asian economi should also let the adjust proceed and s ul their own domest spend enough to preserv high employ  for the unit state  the situat is complic in a differ way   my own prefer approach would be to have fiscal tighten to rais nation save and perhap even monetari accommod to keep at full employ   we should recogn that the fiscal tighten and lower of interest rate would like add to the fall in the dollar   in the press late there have been mani statement impli that fiscal tighten is an altern to a fall dollar   in particular  european seem to think that if we would onli cut our deficit  the euro wouldn   t rise so much   no way   fiscal tighten would normal start or be part of a process that lead to a fall dollar   the two are complement much more than substitut  in the unfortun like case that fiscal tighten   not occur  there would have to be monetari tighten in the unit state to offset the new export demand from the fallen dollar  as discuss by dave earlier   such a respons would fulfil the fed   s mandat  but it would be less prefer  at least to me  from a nation or world standpoint becaus it would not rais   and could lower   nation save   with no net capit inflow  this mean lower domest invest  to return to the central question  with this overal design  should we continu rais the fund rate  and how fast   one outcom that would persuad me to sit still for a while  or mayb rais it at a gentl rate  would be the desir prospect of real fiscal tighten in this countri   i haven   t been one of the committe   s dove in recent meet  but if we had the real fiscal    tighten and higher nation save  i   d happili join the flock of dove and argu that the fed should tri to keep the economi at full employ by paus or perhap even lower interest rate  on the other side  a much less desir outcom that could also persuad me to sit still is if europ and japan don   t come through with the desir expansionari polici   if neither s ul their economi suffici or is abl to s ul their economi suffici  world demand could easili be defici  and there could be a world slowdown  possibl even recess   in such circumst  the fed also might well have to leav rate alon for a while   but between these two extrem  there is a broad middl ground   not much fiscal tighten here and a world economi grow at moder nonrecessionari rate   which is essenti the  book forecast   in such a case  u s  demand will be bol  by the combin of a fall dollar and expansionari fiscal polici  and we should continu rais rate at a measur pace   henc  i am still in favor of this strategi but will to chang my posit if i see  among other thing  either credibl u s  budget tighten on the good side or sign of a world slowdown on the bad side
thank you  mr  chairman   there are two perspect that i   d like to add  one from the bank communiti and the other a follow up on the fiscal issu   if i were to compar the discuss i   ve had with banker on what they see in the economi to the comment that i   ve heard around the room  i   d say there is a notabl differ   peopl around the room have describ the economi in term rang from    decid posit    on the upsid to    reason    on the downsid  wherea the banker i   ve talk would come down more on the side of    reason    than    decid posit      if there is a signific expans take place in the busi sector  it   s happen outsid the bank industri in term of their c i lend   c i lend is grow  but    there   s a strong sens that it reflect a greater appetit for risk take in the lend portfolio as oppos to an expans of busi  as other of you have suggest  a lot of the demand for busi lend has come from the smaller entiti   larger entiti that have the option of either expand here or offshor are as apt as not to expand offshor   the entiti that do not have that option  of cours  are expand through borrow at domest bank   u s  bank also have taken on more m a lend   which more typic had been the purview of the capit market   as a result of the relat low demand they   ve found for typic c i loan   there are a coupl of except to that   of cours  the most notabl except is in commerci real estat   and yet  in condominium develop in particular  sever banker have report that the growth in volum of new condo start is absolut unsustain   moreov  the end of the cycl is typic when you see convers of apart  and that is rampant  particular in some market   to the point where there almost assur need to be an adjust in the near futur   all that said  howev  there still is noth in that observ that would suggest that we should alter our pace of remov monetari polici accommod   we should continu move at the same pace that we have been  with respect to washington  d c   and the willing to take on some fiscal disciplin  there are two point that would suggest a somewhat more posit outlook in that regard   the first is the reaffirm of   snow as treasuri secretari   a presidenti elect  especi the re elect of a presid  is an opportun for wholesal chang  and inde  that has occur   the fact that   snow stay on even after he was hung out to dri for a while suggest that this white hous did not seek the great at the expens of the good   it also suggest that there is an effort to move relat quick on the agenda that flow through the depart of the treasuri  and that agenda certain includ tax reform   governor   express concern at the last meet that    tax reform may be  in fact  explicit tax reduct  that has not yet been fulli flesh out  but nonetheless the team is in place to move forward   the presid is also discuss  at least in part  altern on social secur  which suggest a greater willing to attack that one fundament issu that realli need to be address  the second point that i think is posit has to do with the intellig reform legisl that was pass last week   now  one wouldn   t ordinarili think that there would be a correl between intellig reform and fiscal respons   howev  the passag of that legisl did send an import signal  and that is that a republican hous  a republican senat  and a republican white hous are will to work togeth   two week ago that was not clear   the impedi to enact that legisl came from within the republican rank  and mani peopl in washington see the fact that the congress move veri quick to pass the bill as a suggest that  inde  the republican may work as a team at take direct from the white hous   that  taken along with the fact that certain of the fiscal respons issu such as tax reform  social secur  and medicar are consid a prioriti  i think bode well   thank you
governor bie has laryng  as i   m sure you   re all awar  and     will read her prepar statement  ms  bie  as read by ms       the aspect of the economi that i want to focus on is the improv outlook for consum spend   after a signific slow in the second quarter  real consum spend grew by a healthi     percent annual rate in the third quarter and advanc strong in the last two month   while earli indic of holiday spend impli not as bright a  e as retail have anticip  particular for lower price retail  inventori appear to be close manag   the expect for a strong year in      for retail sale seem more firm ground than earlier this fall   sinc the last fomc meet  oil price have fallen signific     which should put more discretionari spend power in the wallet of consum and help the cash flow of busi that are heavi user of petroleum product  over the past three month  payrol employ gain have exceed their averag pace of the past twelv month   the stronger pace of employ gain will expand the incom base to support continu consumpt growth   while consum should increas save out of current incom for their long term financi health  there are few sign that they are will to build their asset and defer spend at the current  e   long term interest rate are still low by histor standard and have not provid enough incent to encourag signific growth in longer term bank deposit   strong rise hous price have increas asset  and the resumpt in growth of equiti price in the stock market will provid anoth leg to support increas net worth   if recent behavior pattern continu  therefor  consum will be abl to increas spend and show growth of asset  without signific increas in the short term save rate   thus  i have greater confid in the pace of econom growth in the next few quarter  and i believ that we should continu to remov accommod by rais the fed fund rate by    basi point today
thank you   i will call on   madigan
thank you  mr  chairman   financi market were subject to a number of crosscurr over the intermeet period   nonetheless  most financi market price show relat small net movement over the period   as indic in the top left hand panel of exhibit    line    yield on short term treasuri coupon issu were up somewhat as investor conclud that a paus in polici tighten was not immin   at the ten year mark  howev  yield on nomin treasuri  line    and tip  line    declin modest  appar reflect in part investor    sens that growth in real activ was like to be a bit less vigor than they had previous anticip   as note  impli inflat expect for the next five year continu to edg higher  while those for the succeed five year were littl chang  meanwhil  the wilshir index  line    rose     percent  while the nasdaq  line    rose   percent  with equiti price support particular by fall oil price   risk spread on corpor  gse  and emerg market debt  not shown  declin virtual across the board      the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix        as portray in the top right hand panel  money market futur rate indic that the expect path of monetari polici edg up on balanc for the next year but declin slight over a longer period  rough consist with the flatten of the treasuri yield curv   futur quot impli that a   point firm today is essenti built into market interest rate  and as indic by the first bullet in the middl panel  a desk survey taken last week similar reveal that all twenti two primari dealer expect a    basi point move today   all of the dealer also think that you will retain the assess that the risk to both sustain growth and price stabil are balanc and that you will keep the    measur pace    languag   and the survey respons and convers with the dealer indic that none expect you to use today   s announc to signal a paus in tighten go forward   still  market particip do not think you will tighten   point at each meet indefinit into the new year   as note in the bottom panel  two of the primari dealer expect you to paus in februari   even absent a signal today   and seven anticip that you will do so in march   futur quot can be interpret as impli that you will most like tighten    basi point in februari  paus in march  and slow your pace to rough a   point move at everi other meet over the rest of the year   the quarter averag fund rate in the blue chip consensus releas on decemb   suggest that privat forecast expect a bit fa  pace of tighten than built into futur rate  but that consensus still is consist with your paus twice befor the fall   the issu of whether and how soon to slow the pace of polici tighten was the theme of the bluebook present to the committe for this meet   altern a was distinguish by a paus at this meet   altern b and c both involv a   point firm today  but onli altern b includ languag that would suggest a paus in the near term   a case for continu to firm polici by rais the target fund rate anoth   point at this meet is summar in the top panel of exhibit     most import  the expans now seem to be well entrench  with labor market condit improv gradual   the forc that had previous been restrain spend appear to have weaken consider  and the committe might thus believ that it can continu to reduc the unusu degre of monetari accommod put in place in the past sever year without jeopard satisfactori growth   the committe might also be concern about a possibl buildup of inflationari pressur for sever reason   for instanc  member may feel that the staff could be over op ist regard trend product and worri that slow product could begin to put upward pressur on unit labor cost   also  some anecdot inform suggest that increas busi cost continu to put upward pressur on price in some industri   moreov  actual inflat has risen over the past year  and the recent inflat data have tend to come in a bit abov market expect  potenti give momentum to inflat expect   inde  while long term inflat expect have been essenti flat  the rise in actual inflat appar has fed through to some degre into shorter term expect   final  ongo downward pressur on the dollar seem to have augment market concern about    inflat   all of these factor suggest the possibl of some upsid risk to the staff inflat forecast   the committe may also interpret the staff   s revis es  of equilibrium real interest rate as point toward continu monetari tighten over  e   the es  of short run r  present in the middl panel suggest that equilibrium real rate have climb sharpli sinc earli      as the economi has strengthen  although your monetari polici action have boost the actual real rate as well  that increas has lag the advanc in measur of r    consequ  the actual rate remain a bit below the    percent confid interv of the model base es   the darker blue band  and notic below the es  implicit in the  book forecast  the dash line    these measur suggest that polici will need to be firm substanti over  e  but as emphas in the bluebook and the staff memo  the es  of equilibrium real rate should not be interpret as prescript for the current stanc of monetari polici   rather  these measur es  the real fund rate that  if maintain over the next three year  would close the output gap at the end of that  e period   interpret a bit more loos  the r  es  attempt to measur the weight averag real rate over the next sever year consist with close the output gap at the end of that period and thus do not have a direct implic for the set of the fund rate today   even assum that such es  are accur  bring the real rate quick to some es  of r  would like be undesir for sever reason   first  the committe might be dissatisfi with the persist of a posit output gap for anoth three year   second  the committe might be concern about the downward pressur on inflat that could result from that persist   and  third  for a varieti of reason the committe may consid gradual adjust of the fund rate toward it ul  equilibrium to be the prefer polici approach   from that perspect  these r  es  may be most use in provid a benchmark for think about the appropri trajectori of polici over the next sever year  for exampl  by consid the averag amount of s ulus that ought to be appli dure that period as polici move gradual toward a stanc thought like to be consist with medium run equilibrium   but even if you find these measur general help in think about polici  as we obvious hope  you will still need to weigh a number of other factor in set polici   for exampl  how your outlook differ from those embed in the model and the  book  how quick ani output gap should be close  where inflat is now relat to your prefer level  and where it would end up under a polici deriv from consid these measur   the question of the appropri trajectori of polici go forward is what motiv the staff to present altern b and c as distinct polici choic in this bluebook   as note in the bottom left hand panel  if the committe believ that polici tighten can proceed at a slower pace than it has over the past six month  it might wish to combin a   point move at this meet with a signal of a possibl paus in the firm process befor long   policymak might think that the process of firm can now proceed at a slower pace for at least sever reason   first  some    output gap appar remain  and it   not appear to be close particular rapid   second  the four rate hike so far may be seen as have alreadi reduc signific the degre of polici accommod   that would be the case if  for instanc  member had a weaker outlook than the model and thought short run r  was near the lower edg of the    percent confid band in the middl panel   a relat low r  could result from a continu of the rang of factor that have appar been restrain the expans over the past few year   for exampl  the persist of unusu busi caution   such consider might inclin the committe to shift to a somewhat slower pace of polici firm and signal such a shift today through the word suggest under altern b   howev  policymak may instead believ that the recent pace of tighten should be maintain  at least for a while longer  or even step up   and consequ that  as in altern c  the committe should not give ani signal at this meet of an immin paus   as note in the right hand panel  the exist degre of polici accommod is substanti  at least as judg by the differ between the real fund rate and the rang of point es  indic by the red band in the middl panel   all economist agre that monetari polici work with long lag  and member may be concern that the consider amount of monetari s ulus could be cumul into an inflationari impetus that will becom fulli evid onli with the passag of  e   policymak may see the recent inflat data  as well as the downward pressur on the dollar  as possibl the lead edg of a ramp up in under inflat trend   final  the seem buoyant attitud toward risk in financi market may argu at the margin for a firmer path of polici   your last exhibit repeat tabl   from the bluebook   should the committe wish to suggest the possibl of a paus at an upcom meet  as in altern b  it could do so by indic  as shown by the red text  that    the committe   s polici action sinc mid      have result in a signific reduct in the degre of monetari polici accommod    while note that    nonetheless  the       stanc of monetari polici remain somewhat accommod      the econom descript could be updat by refer to the    earlier    rise in energi price and by indic that labor market condit    continu to improv gradual      although market particip appear to anticip some slow in the pace of polici firm in       few if ani expect you to signal a downshift today   henc  select of this altern like would lead investor to mark up the probabl of a near term paus   short  and intermedi term interest rate would like declin notic  stock price could rise  and downward pressur on the dollar could resum   if the committe  in contrast  believ that polici tighten should continu at the recent pace   and perhap even wish to allow for a potenti acceler in polici tighten   and henc   not wish to signal the possibl of a paus  onli modest chang to the statement would appear necessari  as in altern c   choic of this altern today like would have minim market impact   should the committe harbor signific concern about inflat  it could indic that    the earlier rise in energi price and an escal of busi cost have the potenti to     contribut to upward pressur on price      it could also state that    labor market condit continu to improv     therebi hint that condit on the real side of the economi are not like to imped continu polici tighten at upcom meet   in close  it might also be worth note that the committe would not necessarili have to signal a paus in advanc through it announc   first  the phrase    measur pace    presum was intend  at least origin  to allow for the possibl that polici might not be firm at each meet   although some market particip have come to read it as impli regular polici move   second  the market   s expect for polici have not been complet immobil by the exist languag   market yield still fluctuat to some degre with incom econom and financi inform  given the implicit condit in the languag  and thus market could come to anticip a paus   even without a signal   should the data point fair clear toward the desir of a slower pace of tighten
just a clarif   you have altern c and then you actual have an altern c  ²  with altern c focus on energi price as a growth issu   or at least have a potenti impact on growth   and c  ² focus on energi price and busi cost as an inflat issu
yes   i wouldn   t focus sole on energi cost  but that was the intent   to highlight that in particular as well as other element of cost that are put pressur on price
what would sentenc   look like under altern c  ²   that wasn   t veri clear
we   d simpli say     output appear to be grow at a moder pace  but the earlier rise in energi price and an acceler of busi cost have the potenti to contribut to upward pressur on price
so you   d have    moder pace    and    price    juxtapos there   then you   d have     labor market condit continu to improv
that   s correct
further question of      paus   i actual have veri littl to add to what has been said so far   it is probabl worthwhil reiter  to emphas it  that the polici we have been engag in is larg the consequ of the fact that we   ve had a veri shallow recess and we have not had a recoveri that is typic of histor experi   in the past  we   ve had rebound that involv an ongo process compar to other cyclic recoveri  so the forecast of the recoveri has been a lot easier than we have found it to be in recent month  this  e  without the typic rebound  we   ve been get a set of endogen forc that impact with modest exogen forc to produc not veri great chang in the economi   inde  if one goe back and look at a  book from earlier this year  the economi  sn   t look all that much differ from what we are see now   so not have a consider histori to draw upon to make judgment about various potenti outcom   and one cannot readili project the under trend and assum that a particular outlook is go to materi   we end up in a period where our forecast is somewhat befog  we can put down a whole seri of number   we can allow our econometr model just to run their equat and see what they tell us about the under forc affect the outlook   but i suspect that we will find the result forecast not veri use or accur when look at in retrospect   that lead me to the conclus that we should continu our polici of    opportunist de accommod     as i like to call it  so that we are move toward a posit where we will be better set to respond to what might happen to the economi either way   it   s almost like the tenni player who has to move sharpli to his right to hit a shot and tri to go back to the center of the court as quick as possibl to be in a posit to handl shot come in ani direct   if we can bring the fund rate up to a level that we feel confid is put us in the center of the court   readi to respond to shot in ani quadrant   i suspect that we will find ourselv in as good a    posit as we are like to get   i think we will find that tri to fine tune polici to the forecast is a veri difficult game to play   we can seduc ourselv into believ that the relat accuraci of the forecast is someth we can count on in the futur   histori suggest otherwis  so  i think we probabl would be best posit if we implement altern c   go with an increas of    basi point in the fund rate and make onli those chang in paragraph   that are essenti to bring it up to date   therefor  i would recommend altern c with the statement as stipul for that altern   presid hoenig

thank you  mr  chairman   in the not inconsider number of discuss of communic polici over the past few year  member have often brought the meet minut into the mix   for those in favor of expedit the releas of the minut  the benefit of such a chang  as list in the top left box of your first exhibit  includ provid more  e and nuanc inform about the econom outlook and monetari polici choic   in particular  releas the minut well befor the follow meet would help prevent situat in which market particip incorrect interpret the lag minut as reflect current committe think   the minut convey the rang of view within the committe  and expedit their releas could be seen as an advantag for a few reason   after their releas  market particip will be abl to put individu statement by policymak into perspect accord to the descript in the minut of the spectrum of member    prefer   in addit  policymak might be more will to speak public about a wider rang of polici possibl if they can point to a mention of those possibl in the minut  therebi improv public communic   in addit  if member thought the expedit minut provid a suffici complet and  e explic of the polici decis  the polici statement releas after the meet could potenti be shorten   some member might not be convinc by such argument  perhap for the reason given in the box at the top right   expedit releas could lead to undu market attent to the minut  particular so if earli releas were taken as a sign that policymak attach enhanc import to them   moreov  member might be concern that ani result increas attent could complic the committe   s deliber   in particular  member might conceiv alter their discuss at the meet in order to be sure certain view were repres in the minut   it is also conceiv that a member would offer support for a given polici decis onli in return for agreement on a particular refer in the minut   if an advers dynam of increas market attent and increas content within the committe set in  the result might be that the minut would becom sanit and increas unhelp over  e   a last object has been that it may be oper difficult to manag expedit the minut    in that regard  though  i note that  as describ in the memo by   doyl circul last week  two central bank   the bank of england and the swedish riksbank   have succeed in releas minut about two week after their polici meet   to be sure  though  the polici committe of those institut are smaller than the fomc  and their membership are not so geograph dispers   to address concern about oper difficulti  this januari the committe direct   the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix        it secretariat to conduct an experi in expedit the minut   as shown in the middl panel  for the typic fomc cycl  we post a first draft for your consider seven work day after the meet   base on your feedback  we produc two more draft over the next week  with the goal of gather indic of your intent to approv the final draft in  e to meet a hypothet public deadlin of two o   clock on friday afternoon   in order to meet this schedul and to assess the experi  as note in the bottom panel  staff chang the process of produc the minut in sever way   we contract with a privat firm to produc transcript quick    this chang also provid an import redund in our oper that was previous lack    we distribut draft respons among more staff so that work could be done along parallel stream   and we   ve provid more systemat feedback on your comment in the final week to make it more like that the revis process come to closur by the deadlin   to make it easier for a geograph dispers membership to approv the minut in a relat short  e frame  staff develop a procedur for secur  chad free  vote   last  we collabor with staff member in public affair at the board and the market group at the feder reserv bank of new york to assess the like market reaction had the minut been releas earli   this involv intern generat repres headlin and wire servic stori about the minut consist with the current environ and ask staff familiar with financi market to hazard a guess as to the like market respons   i take away four lesson  list in exhibit    from this experi   first  use more resourc to produc and distribut the minut soon after the meet is help in ensur that they are a true and accur record of your discuss   in particular  memori are still fresh  and inform arriv after the meet is less like to shade the summari of the discuss   second  not all fomc particip were familiar with all the rule govern the draft of the minut   there   s been an oral tradit enforc a hierarchi of    a few        sever        mani     and    most    committe member and defin whether speaker are describ as    member    or not   to make this process a bit more transpar  last week i circul a guid to the prepar of the minut draft by your deputi secretari        third  the expedit schedul pose the risk that not all member will be abl to vote by the deadlin  given complic travel schedul and holiday  on two of six occas this year i was abl to reach onli eleven member by the  e the minut would have been releas to the public   that  howev    not strike me as a particular serious problem given that the result of the notat vote would not be report until the subsequ set of minut   as long as we have the approv of a major of member  the minut can be releas on  e  and we can note the subsequ concurr or dissent with that decis by those who could not be reach in the follow set of minut   a more serious risk is that the schedul may be too tight to achiev a consensus by the public deadlin  a risk that is elev if some member have signific and contradictori comment on the first and second draft  my last observ is that friday afternoon is a terribl  e to releas the minut  on two occas  the minut would have been releas on the same day as a    surpris employ report and probabl would have ad to the alreadi signific market volatil   in addit  financi market tend to be thin on friday afternoon  elev the possibl of an outsiz reaction   this was a limit experi  and in the bottom panel i   ve list sever aspect of a new regim that went untest   in particular  the experi was conduct over a period in which there were no signific disagr among member about the direct of polici  perhap lead to a fals sens of secur about the eas with which a draft consensus could be achiev   nor has there been an intermeet confer call this year  so we did not have to work through procedur to handl that conting   such a possibl   not seem to pose an insurmount obstacl  though   i would suggest that  as a rule  the minut relat inform avail from the close of the prior meet to the close of the current meet  thus  the descript of an intermeet confer call would be includ in the minut of the next regular schedul meet   if the committe want to ensur the continu  e releas of inform  it could acknowledg a meet held outsid it regular schedul in the subsequ polici announc   becaus the experi stop short of actual releas the statement earli  it remain unclear how much increas scrutini more  e minut will receiv or how member will adjust their edit behavior   it is also unclear how the public will react to the inclus in the minut of condit statement  such as heighten interest in certain key data releas or the possibl of an intermeet confer call   that said  the minut do not often includ such condit statement  moreov  when they do  they tend to expand on statement alreadi made public in the committe polici announc  impli that the inform content of such condit statement in the minut would seem to be limit   on the last exhibit  i   ve list three possibl for today   s meet   as one possibl  the committe could vote today to expedit the releas of the minut   if so  i recommend begin expedit releas with the minut of the februari      meet and adopt a schedul of releas the minut of regular meet three week after the day of the polici decis   by begin with the februari meet  the decis would be note in the minut of today   s meet  which would be releas soon after the februari meet and thus give the public advanc notic of the new polici   ad a few day to the schedul by releas the minut after three week would give staff more  e to draft and particip more  e to comment   such a schedul would also posit the releas in the middl of the week  which would be less like to caus difficulti   you might altern decid that the experi has not been conclus enough and decid to extend it   if so  i recommend shift to a three week schedul becaus it seem more sustain  last  you might not have like what you saw in the experi or feel that the risk are too great to establish the preced of earli releas   if you do stop the experi  i recommend continu approxim the same product and intern distribut schedul so that the minut are prepar while the memori of the meet is still fresh     about one thing i am sure   if you decid to expedit the minut  you will be set a preced that will make it hard to go back to lag releas if the result prove disappoint   in such procedur matter  you have tend to go forward onli if a preponder of particip support the chang   to facilit your discuss  i have ask presid pool and governor kohn to make the case  respect  for maintain the status quo and for expedit the minut   so i first turn to presid pool
thank you   let me start with three preliminari comment   first  i congratul the staff on the way this experi was conduct   i think that we   ve learn a lot from it  and i think that the earli draft of the minut  in ani event  will surviv and should surviv   so i want to start with that observ   second  as note  i do not favor earli releas of the minut   but i do regard the issu as be fair close drawn   i want to be clear that my opposit to earli releas is not base on a slipperi slope argument   i don   t see that earli releas is go to lead to other demand for inform that would be harm   so i   ve decid this case on it own merit   in my view  earli releas reinforc a favor postur of open but   not creat substant improv in communic   also  earli releas has risk and could not be easili withdrawn if it is unsuccess   instead  the outcom in that case  i believ  would be to make the minut more vagu and  therefor  less use than they are now  here is the structur of my argument   our aim in communic polici should be to move in the direct of perfect the ration expect macroeconom equilibrium   the key to better communic for polit account is continu polici success   ani chang in communic polici that may on the surfac appear to enhanc polit account but  in fact  interfer with polici success will not  in the end  serv the purpos of enhanc polit account   in particular  miscommun with market will damag rather than enhanc polit account   the problem of improv communic for the purpos of improv monetari polici outcom is reason well defin and will be the basi of my argument     now  to move in the direct of perfect the equilibrium  an import goal is to encourag market reaction to new inform that match the fomc   s reaction to the same inform   the issu is not primarili the market   s reaction to new inform between one meet and the next but  instead  to new inform over a span of quarter and even year   we want the market and the committe to assess monetari polici implic of inform the same way   the flow of new inform is continu   the committe meet at discret interv  when the market react appropri to new inform  the economi has an import built in stabil   this goal is quit differ from condit the market to expect a certain polici decis at the next fomc meet   such condit may be necessari and use  but it should not come at the expens of enhanc the market understand of the fundament of monetari polici  here are some principl that i believ should appli to the minut   first  it is extrem import that the minut be faith to the transcript   eventu  the two will be care compar   second  the minut should not themselv be a market disturb   market may react  of cours  to the minut  but the reaction should be help and not harm to the achiev of polici goal   my concern is not undu attent to the minut but misinterpret of them   the issu is not whether interest rate will respond to the minut but whether the respons will be in the correct direct and amount   if there is never a market respons to the minut  then we can conclud that the minut are not provid use inform  i   m convinc   and this is the third principl   that there are  e when the most construct thing the fomc can do is to remain quiet   minut releas befor the next fomc meet will alway be an event   minut releas on the current schedul are  at most  a minor event to the market   i think we should be care about period like the fall of       when long    term capit manag was implod   for exampl  the minut of the meet of august           contain this sentenc      in the view of one of these member  the trend in monetari growth along with indic of rise specul imbal and excess in various market for financi and nonfinanci asset call for a prompt firm of monetari polici      would such a statement have been help in provid clear guidanc to the market as to how the committe would like respond to develop in the financi market   would the statement have been ignor as it repres the view of onli one member   i   m quit sure that the sentenc would not have been help   i don   t know whether it would have been ignor   suppos the committe were close split in such circumst  and it was not just the view of one member   disclosur of a close split would not be help   could the minut be true to the transcript without disclos the split   i think we all agre that we can coalesc behind the major view on a committe led  of cours  by the chairman  but we do not want to stifl discuss of compet view around the tabl   in short  it is not hard for me to imagin circumst in which the expect of earli releas of the minut would inhibit discuss   i would feel more comfort about earli releas if the staff had review the transcript and minut for the last twenti year or so  look for exampl of discuss that might have been awkward under a polici of earli releas  now  i   ve said that earli releas of the minut will be a market event   what i mean is that the minut will be an event in the same way that the chairman   s tes oni is an event   i believ that the focus of market attent will be on the implic of the minut for the polici action at the next fomc meet   the current releas schedul for the minut has the advantag of focus attent on the committe   s think and not on the probabl polici decis at the next meet   the advantag of reli on speech and tes oni   rather than minut with a fix releas schedul and the constraint that minut must be faith to the transcript   is that speech    and tes oni can be craft to be more or less explicit  depend on circumst  and they can be adjust right up to the  e of deliveri   quit frank  with earli releas of the minut  i believ that in circumst like the fall of      the open of discuss at the fomc meet and or the natur of the minut will be affect  my view on the natur of market attent to the minut under earli releas is that the financi press talk most to trader and trader care littl about anyth other than the veri short run   trader want clue about the committe   s like decis at the next meet  and they realli don   t care veri much about the fundament of monetari polici   provid clue about our next meet ought not to be our main interest in communic with the market  i   ll finish with some unresolv issu   we   ve alreadi talk about what happen with minut of meet held between regular schedul meet   and incident  we might find ourselv with a problem of how we justifi a delay releas rather than a three week public schedul for those   could the committe discuss the possibl of an intermeet polici action as it did at it meet of decemb           and march            those discuss were disclos in the minut of the meet   i think the committe could not discuss the possibl of an intermeet consult unless the special meet was go to be held befor the releas date of the minut   to releas minut in which there is a discuss of the possibl of a polici action befor the next regular meet would creat market uncertainti that would not be construct  in sum  i do not believ that earli releas of the minut will assist measur in communic the fundament of monetari polici  work toward further perfect the ration expect macroeconom equilibrium   i believ that earli minut will be read primarili for clue about the committe   s probabl action at it next meet   final  i believ that earli releas will at  e be a market disturb  when the committe would be better off remain quiet     moreov  i think it will inhibit the discuss of certain issu at regular meet   howev  let me restat my view that the issu on earli releas is close drawn  and i   m not predict disast  and i do believ that a fed postur of open and transpar is appropri   thank you
i think we should speed up releas of the minut to about three week after the meet  along the line of the new schedul that   suggest   i agre that there are risk and potenti cost  but i think they are part within our abil to control and they are outweigh by the potenti gain   potenti gain come from the more  e releas of the addit inform that   refer to   i do think that this inform  by align the minut better in  e with the inform that we use for our decis  will help key market reaction to better match the fomc   s reaction to the same inform   the minut contain a more complet explan of whi we reach our decis  includ how we are look at futur develop  than ever will be possibl in an announc   they give a much finer read on what the committe view as risk and skew in the outlook than can be convey by a one  or two sentenc balanc of risk statement   they give a sens of altern perspect of committe member  and this has been miss  for the most part  as the number of dissent has dwindl in recent year  i think divers view further fill out the pictur of the issu the committe is focus on and where it see the risk   an earlier understand of the committe   s rational and rang of view should help the public interpret the econom situat as it develop over the latter half of the intermeet period and more broad to interpret our reaction to incom data   the releas would be anoth news event   i entir agre with bill there   and market may not alway react in way we find desir   this may prove uncomfort from  e to  e  but i   m convinc that  on averag  over  e market reaction to the inform in the minut will reinforc our polici and help us achiev our object     earlier releas of the minut should prove use for other aspect of our intermeet communic   i think it   s help to have anoth committe document in the public domain  there are alreadi a lot of intermeet event in the speech and interview that we do   the minut should assist market to put our individu speech and interview in better perspect  make it less like that market will make the mistak of think that ani of us  except for the chairman  is speak for the committe   i   ve found it use in speech  and especi in answer question in public  to refer the minut or the announc   and have this document publish earlier will give us more opportun to util this method of put our own remark in the overal context and to reinforc the committe   s messag  i would not want to trade earli releas of the minut for a shorter  less forward look announc on the day of the meet   i think there are use thing we can say about the futur in that statement   i count the experi of the last five year   includ the last year and a half or so of interest rate guidanc   as success in that regard   we   ve provid inform that has help the market make accur polici predict  and in my view we have not constrain our abil to take need polici action   cut back on the announc would leav a three week void in which market would have less guidanc from us  but i recogn that we   ve had a difficult  e decid on what and how much to say in that statement   there is no consensus on which way to go next in this regard  and announc have evolv  and are like to continu to evolv  slowli   all these tendenc argu that the valu of the minut to supplement the announc is like to increas over  e  the main negat  as bill stress  are the potenti feedback on the minut and even more serious on the deliber of the committe   we cannot adopt a new transpar tool that would in ani way make the committe discuss less use and product   i do think the    experi  togeth with the extra  e embed in     s propos  should take care of the concern about whether the committe could converg on an agre upon document in the  e allot   and   has explain how intermeet confer call would be handl  with regard to the feedback on the minut or discuss  i think we should rememb that these are minut  not transcript   art word can make them comprehens and truth record of what we discuss and of the reason for our decis  without includ inform that would endang financi stabil   we should continu to err on the side of comprehens coverag   we should not cut the minut back   my experi as secretari was that  on those occas when i debat how much to includ of a particular discuss  the committe benefit over  e from a fuller  more comprehens set of minut  even at the risk of some near term discomfort  becaus the abil to refer the minut in later tes oni and public discuss was so use  in our last discuss  some of us express concern that expedit minut would constrain condit or conting deliber for fear of how they would be reflect in the minut   i read the polici paragraph in the minut for the last two year   not the last twenti year  i confess  bill   but in the last few year  the paragraph relat to our polici discuss contain few  if ani  conting statement that aren   t foreshadow by the announc   in fact  in think about your exampl of decemb      and march       in both of those case the announc said that we would be monitor develop care   so i think the announc foreshadow what the minut said about the possibl of an intermeet move  in term of condit  i couldn   t find anyth in look at the minut of the last few year that i felt would have done the committe harm if it had been releas earlier   now  i didn   t look back twenti year   condit in the minut is usual implicit  not explicit   discuss      give the reader a better sens of the variabl that are inform the committe   s decis at that moment  and they don   t typic say    if x occur  then we will do y      moreov  as i note a few second ago  there are alway way of cover discuss without contribut to instabl  i think we do that alreadi   as a consequ  earlier releas of the minut should not deter the committe from a free discuss of altern outcom and their polici implic  final  this is under our control   we will be set the preced over the next coupl of year that will guid futur committe   i think we can disciplin ourselv to maxim the gain and minim the potenti cost of this exercis   thank you
thank you   the floor is now open for discuss
i   ll speak first  partial becaus i   ve spent five year work with   on get us to this happi place  and i don   t share his sigh about it   i think expedit the releas of the minut is a use step for the committe to take   my view on this  i must admit  have chang   the last  e we discuss this  i was oppos to earli releas   this  e   though i agre with bill that it is a veri close call   i have move slight to the point that i think it is  on balanc  a good thing to do  the benefit are one that i think don has point out   the minut will be more contemporan in  e with the relev meet   they are a more subtl  nuanc  vari represent of what transpir at the meet than we can possibl provid in a one page statement   they also have the benefit of give us a touchston on which to review other commentari  they may actual in some sens drown out some commentari and highlight other   i agre there will be cost   i   ve worri a great deal   and i continu to worri   about the high attent that is like to be paid to these minut  particular sinc i think of them primarili as a reflect of histor relev not necessarili a predictor of the futur   but they do talk about    what has happen   i also worri about a point that bill made veri clear  which is the risk that these minut  sinc they will be an    event    where the committe is involv in the market between meet  would drown out other news when in fact   in term of futur polici deliber   that news might be more import than anyth that was in the minut   there are some cost that i think we can manag without much difficulti   for exampl  on the question of whether or not the minut gradual will becom smooth and polish and not be an accur reflect of what transpir at the meet  i think we and the staff can manag that  so given the close call  whi did i move from think this wasn   t a good idea to think it is  on balanc  a reason idea   the answer ul  is just the realiti of life   we alreadi are in the market between meet   current we have to be in the market between meet with an old set of minut as oppos to a more relev set of minut   unfortun  in spite of our effort to educ the market that this document is histor and   not relat to what has happen in the past six  seven  or eight week  they still react   perhap more than they should  though some  appropri   to the inform that   s in the minut   and they get it wrong  i think  about as often as they get it right  so recogn that we are in a posit   contrari perhap to the posit i   d like to be in   where we   re interact as a committe both on the day of the meet and then whenev the minut are releas  on balanc i think it make sens to have those minut be a littl more contemporan and a littl fresher  as oppos to be veri much out of tune   i say that becaus in either case the market treat them  some  appropri and at other  e inappropri  as a reflect of the committe   s view   so my view on this issu have chang  i   ve move to prefer  on balanc  to releas the minut earlier   and i think this experi has been veri  veri use in that regard
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve felt for a long  e that the minut  given the way we current handl the  e of their releas  are an unappreci or at least underappreci asset   so i continu to strong favor move up the releas date   i think don basic made the case  so let me just quick summar thing as i see them  in my experi  the minut are accur  they are comprehens  and they are valuabl  they illustr the think of the committe  and they get into the issu that we discuss when we consid polici   i think all of that is import to communic to the public   in short  i believ it would improv communic to releas the minut earlier  when peopl would have an incent to take a real interest in them   and that  to me  is the reason for do it  i agre that there are some potenti downsid  and i don   t want to overst or exagger the benefit   but i do believ that  on balanc  the benefit are rather compel   i also think that it   s certain possibl from  e to  e that market particip will read someth in the minut that we believ is innocu and make a lot more of it than we would   but in my view we shouldn   t be so paternalist and worri that  if market particip don   t get it right everi  e  someth has gone serious wrong   most market particip are smart  sophist peopl  and i think  on balanc  they will get it right most of the  e  and when they don   t  that   s their busi
i support the expedit releas of the minut   i think we should point out that on a number of occas this year the delay releas of the minut has actual confus the market   step on our messag from the most recent meet by send a somewhat differ signal   and although i don   t have a lot of market contact  a number of them did contact me at those  e and ask     what   s go on here      second  i would put more weight on the notion    that we all have to go out and give speech and talk and answer question and we worri about give the wrong signal and confus the market   it would be a comfort to have a committe document out there to which we can refer and which the market can use for put our remark in perspect   that will reduc the risk that we all face of inadvert move the market or creat a misimpress   and final  i would just note  as     s studi show  that a number of other central bank have use this practic effect and have not had serious problem with it
i support earli releas   we don   t have to do this  but i think it   s the sensibl thing to do  and i think it   s the sensibl  e to do it   i can   t improv on the argument made in favor of it by don  gari  and ben   i would say  bill  that the argument you led off with is sort of an argument for extend the delay and take releas of the minut out of the  e frame when they would be view as have ani signal valu for the futur stanc of monetari polici   you weren   t advoc that  but i think it   s awkward to suggest that we should releas the minut outsid the  e period of the meet to which they relat   in my view it   s better to take the risk of some nois ad to the signal by releas the minut between meet  closer to the relev meet  than to have the risk that the releas come after a new polici decis has been made and thus creat broad confus about how to interpret the minut in that context   general i think earli releas will add more perspect to our view about the outlook for inflat and output growth and will provid more context to the rang of view across the committe  therefor  i believ it will give peopl a better sens of the factor shape our decis  and in that sens  i think it would be help
i support earli releas of the minut  mr  chairman   i have for some  e  i think it will give a better sens of the committe   s view and the process of it think with regard to polici  and i believ that will serv the market well
i think the experi to date has been a veri good one   it has produc a much higher qualiti initi product becaus it   s written closer to the  e of the meet  person  i have had no problem keep with the tight schedul  despit a coupl of late comment on my part  and i want to congratul the staff on the work they   ve done to make the process more effici   i think we realli have   no matter what we do with it   a higher qualiti product for both the transcript and the minut as a result   so i would continu do what we   re do  no matter what decis come out of this discuss today  on the issu of earli releas  i think we   ve been conduct this experi in the best of  e  as presid pool mention   our statement has provid what the market has seen as near term assur  absent realli off the chart data  market particip have some sens that polici will continu in a particular direct   so  in that regard  releas the minut earli in this environ probabl wouldn   t have had a whole lot of effect   they would general have confirm what the market knew alreadi  now  i   d alway look at releas the minut earli as kind of a quid pro quo for take out of the statement the word that we   ve had in there for the best part of the last year or so orient the market toward the gradual natur of our do what we   re go to do   as i think back over my year on the committe  when we start to mention the tilt and then the measur pace and gradual natur of remov polici accommod  it was basic to give the market a sens of some condit around our action     i have felt that  if we releas the minut earli  the market will get their condit from the minut  they wouldn   t need it in the statement releas after the meet   we wouldn   t have to tri to figur out all the delic word that   s a shorthand way of tri to tell the market more than we need to tell them   i think the recent past has been a period of  e when we   ve need to tell the market someth about our expect polici path  but go forward that need is not like to be so great   the futur direct of polici won   t be so clear to us   and the market  in fact  ought to be arriv at it own thought about the direct of polici and take out insur in case it is wrong rather than look to particular statement of our for the reason to go in a certain direct  so i view the two communic as a packag   i thought we   d take a lot of the forward look commentari out of the statement   the    measur pace    languag  certain   in return for releas the minut earlier   that could have some good effect  don has gone into them   it could have some bad effect   there could be a  e issu where we end up releas the minut when someth els is go on and we   d have two addit point of nois   but i thought of this as a packag   so i   m find it hard to think about releas the minut with the continu of the    measur pace    languag in the statement   i   d rather chang the two thing at the same  e  in that regard  if it   s go to take us a while to decid how to chang the statement  i would continu the experi on the minut and keep ask ourselv the question that presid pool mention  both for now and in the past   are there reason that expedit the releas of the minut has more of a downsid risk than we now appreci   so i   d be in favor of the middl road here   i recogn that it   s a difficult decis to make  and i wouldn   t make it now   i   d make it when we   re readi to chang the statement  which i hope we   ll be abl to do sooner rather than later  and in the interim  i   d continu the experi
i would support earli releas   i would do it unequivoc   unlik cathi  i don   t view this as someth under the conserv of law and inform here   so if we give out more inform sooner  i don   t think we have to take anyth back   in particular  i think the statement are work veri well now  and i wouldn   t chang those in the least   i just plain support earli releas  let me make three other quick point   bill mention that  if we didn   t have earli releas of the minut  we   d still have a number of speech as a communic tool   well  member speech are member speech  they are not statement from the whole committe   i don   t think the two are equival  and i   d rather have someth from the whole committe   on the question of whether the market would misinterpret the data  i can   t see how bring the minut closer to when the data came out would increas misinterpret   this is a point don made   i think it would reduc misinterpret   and  third  i   d like to support a point that ben made  which is that  when the minut come out after we   ve given the statement for the next meet  there   s inevit confus about that   it has happen sever  e  and with earli releas of the minut we get away from that   so  to me  it   s becom clearer and clearer that we ought to go to earli releas and that we shouldn   t do anyth to our statement
mr  chairman  like roger  i was in the group origin that was veri uneasi about this   but i   ve come to the other side and believ that  on balanc  it is probabl the thing to do  let me mention just a coupl of thought  without complet repeat what other have said   i would also commend   and the staff and bill and don for help us understand some of the issu involv   i was think that more and more over the last few year   start with    dave and his staff and our own staff   we have use the concept of error band around our forecast   and it seem to me that there are  in fact  distinct opinion band around our view in a meet   i   ve been among those who have been veri uncomfort tri to boil down our post meet statement to a few phrase   i share some of cathi   s feel that  if we   re go to releas the minut earlier  we might like to have a tradeoff at some point and that might be the way to accomplish it   i agre complet with the point that ben  roger  and   all made about the fact that we   re make speech anyway and the market is analyz what we say   i   ve found myself over and over again a week or two after a meet  when it   s  e to go back out and hit the street again  wish that the minut were in play so that they could provid a frame of refer for my comment   i think it   s a distinct advantag to have the minut in the public domain earlier  final  i   d note a coupl of nuanc that perhap could go unsaid   one of them i say with some trepid   in the origin discuss  i rais some concern about not know what happen after all the comment come in or how they get resolv     has done a nice job of tell me what he did in term of the disposit of my comment   but i have no concept of what other comment came in and what kind of process he went through behind the scene to take them into account   i don   t mean that as a lack of confid in either   or you  mr  chairman  to tailor the final minut appropri   they   ve turn out pretti well   but there may be other secretariat or other chairmen that i   d be a littl uncomfort just turn loos and give a blank check   in the last discuss of this you suggest that it might be possibl to have a small edit committe so that somebodi would know what kind of comment were come in and how they were handl   so that issu of how differ are resolv when various comment come in still make me a littl uneasi     let me make one final comment   if we   re not go to releas the minut earli but continu to produc them earli  i wonder if we don   t leav ourselv a littl vulner to critic if somebodi outsid find out that we have  in fact  produc them but have put them on a shelf   if the minut are in final form and peopl find out about that  i think we   re realli vulner to somebodi say     whi didn   t you releas them      so i don   t know whether that halfway hous work or not   thank
mr  chairman  i think that the experi was veri help   my own feel is that releas the minut earli will provid use inform to the market   i think it will help us communic better   i agre  as other have said  that it will be veri help in our speech and interview   and other central bank are do it   also  strict from the standpoint of logic  we are produc minut  and we are go to releas them at some point   we now know that we have the technic abil to releas them earlier than we have been   it   s rather difficult to argu that we should delay releas them becaus we think peopl are go to misus the inform   that just  sn   t hang togeth from a logic standpoint   i don   t know that we could pass the    red face    test in make that argument in public  i agre with cathi in that i would also veri much like to take out the forward look statement in our announc   but as for the idea of packag these two chang togeth  i think it would be veri difficult to accomplish just in term of tri to get agreement among the committe   it   s difficult enough to get agreement on one piec of this let alon two piec at the same  e   so i just don   t know if it   s practic to tri to do that   if we decid to go this rout  i do have one minor suggest on the announc   but whi don   t i hold off on that until we decid whether we   re go to do this or not
i strong support expedit releas for a lot of the reason that governor kohn and other have express   i have a general predilect toward more transpar  the more inform in the market  the better   i just want to make three point   one is that bring this inform out earlier in  e would resolv uncertainti earlier   if we see ani market reaction to this  for the most part it would just repres a shift in the  e of market volatil   it  sn   t seem to me like that on net  in ani global sens  it   s go to add ani market volatil   so we shouldn   t let the magnitud of perceiv market reaction dissuad us or give us second thought down the road   the second point i want to make is that i do see this as allevi some of the pressur on the committe with regard to the draft of the statement   but  cathi  i think this cut both way   after expedit releas of the minut  the statement will stand as the committe   s latest communic for onli three week   to some extent  that could make it easier to communic and agre on phrase rather than harder  sinc onli three week are at stake rather than an entir intermeet period   i agre with don   i wouldn   t want to see the extent of the communic we do in the statement cut down   final  there   s one tini detail that i hesit to bring up  but it sort of surpris me   if it were up to me  i   d like to see it chang   appar  it   s the tradit that nonmemb    polici statement are exclud from the minut as they   re written  now  i don   t rememb ever notic this befor  and i can   t rememb see it in the orient packag i got    laughter
is that true
in the last sever paragraph  which bear onli on the polici decis  a statement refer onli to comment made by member   befor that  in the discuss of the outlook  the minut reflect the entir go around  so it includ all particip at the tabl
i think that   s the logic necessari posit for this committe to take
the one just enunci by
in the materi   circul last week  the propos was to make the distinct sharper by talk about member and other particip in the earlier section   but  again  when it come to who vote on the polici decis  it   s onli member
suppos we had a situat in which the nonmemb held differ view from those who vote but then we show a unanim vote   we   d get a lot of comment as to whi the indic vote was wrong   we can   t do it that way   the vote member have one privileg and one privileg onli   they get to vote on the polici at that particular point and on the natur of the statement   the discuss of what is go on in the economi and the issu that are on the tabl and the relev for potenti futur polici chang is a full committe discuss   but the specif polici decis that is report is the vote of the then committe   and the membership of the committe chang from  e to  e
mr  chairman  let me just say a coupl of thing   first  there is this mechan for distinguish between member and nonmemb   so a view about polici could easili be attribut to a nonmemb   second  mani statement about the economi by member as well as by other particip seem integr link with their statement about polici   today   s meet  i think  was an excel exampl of that   third  i view the purpos of the minut as a mean to communic to the public the deliber that occur at the meet  rather than the deliber of the committe
no  that is not the purpos   the purpos is essenti to give the reason whi we vote the way we did
well  that   s a differ philosophi  i   ll grant that
it has alway been that way   the point is that  if you divid the committe into two separ group and then discuss what those who vote on the particular statement thought and what those who didn   t vote thought  we are actual no longer talk about the feder open market committe   the feder open market committe is compos of the twelv member who have the right to vote at a particular  e   that   s the law   we can   t get around it
may i ask a clarifi question
in the discuss in the minut that refer to the first part of the meet on the outlook  where you use the term    most        mani     and    sever     is the denomin
it is nineteen
could i just say someth   we are realli discuss two thing here  one is the issu of member versus nonmemb   i would use the term vote member and other member  but be that as it may   and whether you discuss all of their perspect in the last part of the minut on the polici discuss   then there   s the other question  which relat to the chang that   and   propos  about whether to call certain peopl    other particip    in the first part of the discuss   i think that   s push it a bit   i don   t mind  if i   m not a vote member  not have my view includ in the comment on polici   that  sn   t bother me   but to draw a distinct between member and other particip in
well  you don   t have to do that   the basic statement is that in that last section of the minut we are mere stipul    the reason for the polici decis      in that context  onli the view of those who actual vote on the polici are includ  and we don   t make refer to anybodi els
that   s exact what i am suggest to you to do
that   s inde what we do
in tri to actual write down what was the oral tradit  we did find that not everybodi agre on what it was   one thing was clear   as the chairman said  the last two paragraph essenti are view as explain the vote of the committe   henc  in those paragraph  the    member    we talk about are the member of the committe
the problem is if you want to repres everyon   s view in the discuss of the economi sever paragraph earlier and you refer to them as    member      then you   ve use the same word to describ two differ set of peopl
are you use    member    in that differ way now
yes   unfortun  it turn out that the rule was that anyon in the discuss was call a member up to the last coupl of paragraph  and then onli member were call member in the last coupl of paragraph   that seem to be an unsupport inconsist  we didn   t want to exclud nonmemb    character of the economi and the risk to the outlook  and one way to do that would be to call them    particip     speaker      can   t you call the group in the last few paragraph vote member
yes  right   whi not call them vote member as oppos to member
the definit of the feder open market committe is statutori  and there is no such thing as a nonvot member of the feder open market committe
i was rap on the knuckl by joe coyn fifteen year ago on exact that point   the membership of the committe is twelv peopl  and there is no such thing as a nonvot member
whi not call everyon particip in the first part of the
we   re quit happi to do that  yes  speaker      that   s what he   s propos
that   s the propos
so up to paragraph     or whatev paragraph number it is  if you express a view you   re a particip in the meet   if you express a view that is includ in the last coupl of paragraph of the minut  it   s there becaus you are a member
you   re a member  right   okay
okay   presid
well  just briefli  i   d say that i definit support the public of the minut on an expedit schedul  given that it is feasibl   and i agre complet with don   s analysi of the benefit   it   seem to me that  in move toward perfect a ration expect kind of equilibrium  the minut releas in a  e fashion  when they   re still relev  contain enough inform about the committe   s reaction to data and how it process those data that it should help the market improv it understand of the rational for polici   and that includ the fact that there isn   t unanim on the committe  there is a rang of opinion about the outlook and the risk   just in the brief  e that i   ve been back on the committe  there have    been occas when the minut were releas at a point when they were actual mislead becaus the view of the committe had chang   i   ve found that unfortun  let me respond to cathi   s point   while i can understand that  if the committe decid to move back to more formula languag in the statement and to omit ani refer to a consensus about futur polici  some might view earlier releas of the minut as a substitut for those kind of statement   but i would consid that both unnecessari and unfortun   i support ned   s comment about that  in that i think it   s actual quit help to have an explicit statement about the committe   s consensus view regard futur polici   so i would not like to see this becom a simultan decis to forgo that in favor of the earlier releas of the minut
i have two comment   first of all  i see the decis as  on averag  a four week acceler of the releas of the minut  and therefor i think there are two consider  one is  is there a logist problem with earli releas   have had   track me down when i   ve been away from the offic at  e  i realiz that there is a burden in meet the public deadlin   but from what i   m hear  that is not an insurmount problem   the second is  will there be ani signific chang in the minut as a result of that acceler   we won   t realli know the answer to that until we get into it  and i think i   d support don   s evalu that it probabl is a manag issu   also  of cours  the first  e that we releas the minut earli it will be an earli releas   from there on  it will be a schedul releas  so i think we will get the earli releas onli onc    laughter  final  i don   t see this decis and the languag in the statement as a packag   i think on balanc the market would tend to see a less forward look statement as a net reduct in our communic  and i think we would have to revers that polici   that get back to a point that bill    made earlier  which is that we can   t retreat   i   m an incrementalist becaus we can never go back   i think our communic polici will continu to evolv   there is no end game   there is no destin   we ought to make this move but do it in complet isol and not have ani other correspond move along with it
like presid    i thought the experi on earli releas of the minut was motiv by the struggl that we were have in captur the full sens of the committe in the few word that are allow in the press statement   i also have been uncomfort with the code word that we   ve been use in that press statement   and those code word have proven awkward to remov without send unintend signal to the market   so i still prefer a shorter post meet statement with the earli releas of the minut  i also agre with presid     especi after read     s list of untest aspect of the experi   that we   ve been conduct it in the best of  e   that led me to come to this meet in favor of what cathi refer to as the middl of the road ground   let   s extend the experi through circumst that might not be consid the best of  e   i know that this is an unpopular posit  but i thought we were go to continu to perfect our communic strategi and that this would all be one packag   i can see  howev  in listen to my colleagu  that i   m in a minor in that view   nevertheless  i did want to take a more middl of the road approach and continu to improv our communic
when i propos the experi on earli releas of the minut  i thought that we were address a few question   the first one was  can we do it   do we need to chang the process   can we all focus our attent on the minut  given the  e constraint   and    given the new propos process  were we comfort with what would be releas   i think that was the experi   i think we learn a lot from that experi  but not everyth   we learn  for exampl  that we shouldn   t move to releas the minut on a friday   we also decid that we ought to plan to publish the minut three week after the meet   quit frank  i think that   s a good addit of a few extra day to allow for conting   i believ we would have had a harder  e meet the public goal ex post if we had start releas the minut on the previous friday  but one never learn everyth from an experi   so if there are thing left on the tabl  it shouldn   t surpris us   nevertheless  we now have a new process for produc the minut that is more  e   it bring more resourc to the work  has hasten attent to it  and actual is a discuss that   s more symptomat of the  e when the minut would be releas   i  therefor  endors the releas of the minut in a more  e fashion   i know there   s some concern about market reaction   most market particip are grown up  they   ll sort that out   i guess i trust market enough to think that they   ll figur out how to do it   i also share the concern address by presid guynn that  if we have these minut and put them on the shelf and then take them out sever week later  it   s just a matter of  e befor someon say     whi are you do that     so  first of all  i think earli releas is the right thing to do   i now know we can do it   and i think not do it put us in a situat of less disclosur than seem appropri   have said all that  i think we should do it
when we start this process  frank  i was quit dubious that this would be a success oper   i   m pleas to say that i was mistaken   i thought the staff ran an except effect demonstr that this is a feasibl oper   in the cours of discuss the differ altern as we went forward in the various iter  i think we    probabl enhanc our understand of the process and how it was function   so in that regard  i think the experi has work  i   m not concern  as you are  cathi  about the question of the tradeoff with respect to the statement and the minut  larg becaus i don   t look at the forward look statement as someth we   ll be continu in the futur   i look at that as an histor aberr that enabl us to do forward look project and stick with them  becaus we had this extraordinari period of increas product growth for a long period of  e   that essenti put us in a posit of signific control over inflat   inde  we had declin unit labor cost   which enabl us to effect say that we were not concern about inflat for the period ahead  know that product growth  sn   t chang all that quick   we were  therefor  abl to engag in an experi with our statement that last for well over a year  i submit to you that that was the aberr and that the futur will not look that way   we are go to find  when we eventu unwind from this    measur pace    approach that we   re not go to be abl   credibl   to reproduc that kind of descript of monetari polici in the futur  at least not without veri extraordinari event occur   so i think the issu is moot   when this period has end and we   ve reach where we wish to go with this polici of    de accommod     i think we will go back to a veri short term  balanc focus and give the type of indic of feder reserv polici that exist in the past  i think that there are risk to move forward on this earli releas of the minut  but i agre with the way bill put it   name  that it   s a close call   the way i would phrase it essenti is that  if we move forward and we find out in retrospect that it was a mistak  the cost is not all that larg  it   s certain not as larg as i think it would be were we to decid to move the transcript  e from five year to six week and found out that we were wrong   sinc we cannot revers in either case  i    think the cost in the latter case would be far greater than if we to move to the three week window on the minut and find out that was a mistak   we can live with that  i think we can live with it in a way that might requir us to chang the way we handl the minut or what we say in the minut  but it   s not go to be a big deal  so i would lean toward follow     s recommend that we begin expedit releas of the minut at the februari      meet and maintain a schedul of releas the minut of regular meet three week after the day of the polici decis   sinc i perceiv that that   s larg the accept view of this committe  i   d suggest that we put that on the tabl for a vote   call the roll
chairman  span  vice chairman   governor bernank   governor bie  governor   presid hoenig   governor kohn presid    yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes  i guess    laughter
this  incident  is a full vote of both the presid and the  governor on the ground that it   s a decis that relat to the polici of the committe  and all member and potenti member  in my judgment  should vote
okay   i   ll pick up the other in a moment   governor olson presid pianalto   yes i can   t repeat cathi   s way of say yes  but
yes  i guess    is a formal vote
okay   yes
i   m persuad   yes  presid pool yes  presid guynn yes  presid   yes  presid   yes  presid santomero yes  presid  n presid   yes  first vice presid holcomb  yes
i just want to congratul   on an extraordinarili well done job
mr  chairman   i congratul you  too     but may i make one minor suggest
instead of wait to announc this in the minut that will come out right after the februari meet  i would announc it earli in januari for sever reason   one  i think it would give more  e to the market to be awar of this chang   if we put it in the minut of this meet  which would be releas after our februari meet  that would give market particip about twelv trade day befor a new set of minut   those for the februari meet   will be releas   second   and i hate to say this   there   s alway a chanc of a leak   i would hate to see this come out befor we announc it
i think that   s a good point   but let me ask this   what are the reason not to announc it earlier
yes   let me take that a step further   what if we put someth about this in our statement today
i would strong support that  if you can do it   i would do it as soon as possibl   i thought you   d want to draft some word and have the committe look at it first
let me put it this way   i heard no discuss here that in ani way would preclud announc this decis today  given that we   ve come to a conclus and that it was effect unanim   with a coupl of    i guess    vote    laughter   so unless there   s an object  i would submit that it   s certain possibl to do this today   we have the  e to put a sentenc in the statement indic what the committe conclud and vote on regard this issu today
one possibl  mr  chairman  is basic to pick up the languag that you  in fact  vote on      the committe vote unanim to begin expedit releas of the minut with the minut of the februari      meet and to maintain a schedul of releas the minut of regular meet three week after the date of the polici decis      i would also suggest that we put more detail  in term of a paragraph or two  in the minut of this meet  so that market particip will know what is come   you will have preclud the possibl of a leak  and market particip will get more explan at a later date
fine   that   s excel
mr  chairman  will there be a question of whi we   re not proceed with earli releas of the minut for this meet
i   d say it   s becaus the discuss of this issu occur subsequ to the vote on the polici decis
should there be some discuss about nineteen vote versus twelv in that statement
let me go back   that would be the answer  but we could certain move it up if
as long as we   re into this  what   s the problem   if we can releas the februari minut in three week  whi can   t we releas today   s minut in three week
we could releas these minut in three week  if you so direct   i thought there were certain advantag to have a paragraph or two explain whi the committe made this decis and give detail of how the committe would do this go forward befor those in the market actual got the first releas
is that realli necessari
not if you say it isn   t    laughter
well  i think the logic of our decis forc us into the posit of do precis what governor   is suggest   let me ask  are there ani dissent to actual releas the minut of today   s meet on an expedit basi
may i suggest one possibl benefit of wait
by all mean  go ahead
you can all shout it down  but it occur to me that one possibl benefit is to give peopl who follow our everi word   and there are mani peopl around who do   a longer period of  e to get use to the idea and to read the minut of some previous meet in the context of what was go on at the  e   they could calm themselv down in  e to get the februari minut three week after the meet
three week is a long  e    laughter
all right   i   m will to be shout down on that   but that   s the onli reason i can think of for wait
are there ani argument that anyon can think of   the date these minut would be releas would be januari     if it were christma day  i think it would creat a problem
mr  chairman  either we are go to do this or we aren   t   we can   t start out by immedi say     oh  well  that date is not veri conveni
let   s at least think of what we intend to do   the proposit current on the tabl is     to announc that we   re go to releas the minut earli and     to do it in three week   i haven   t heard serious object  nor have i heard serious reason   which are far more import   not to proceed   so unless i hear object from anybodi  i would read it as the consensus of this committe to make the statement that we   re go to do it and to actual do it as of januari     is that accept to everybodi  sever   yes
so be it
mr  chairman  just one more question or suggest for     mayb you   ve alreadi consid this   when you releas the minut for the first  e  you might want to consid ad some of the secretariat   s clarifi inform about the convent in the languag   an explan of some of the terminolog   i don   t know if you were intend to do that  but i think it would be help
i did want to make clear the distinct between    particip    and    member
and the hierarchi of the languag around the term    major    and    sever    and so forth might be help  too
we thought of make a littl index card that we could hand out to fed watcher    laughter
we can expect to be ask if we are one of the    few    or one of the    mani
may we leav that issu of explain the terminolog to the secretariat to make a judgment on  sever   yes
in that event  i want to confirm that the date of our next meet are tuesday and wednesday  februari   and           this meet is adjourn  and we are off to have lunch with our former colleagu  bob    end of meet
