the meet is call to order   would somebodi like to   move approv of the minut of the august    meet
without object   dino kos  pleas
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that were circul just a littl while ago   the top panel of the page   show three month u s  dollar cash deposit rate  the libor fix  and also the three   six   and nine month  forward deposit rate  from june   to septemb      sinc your last meet  three month cash and forward rate trade in a narrow rang as market particip react to mix econom data   the three  and six month forward rate continu to trade below the cash rate  suggest that market particip were assign some  probabl to a reduct in short term rate  especi onc the equiti market began to declin again after the earli august bounc   while short date deposit rate move in a narrow rang  treasuri yield fell  especi in the middl of the yield curv   as shown in the two middl panel on page    yield on treasuri issu have been fall for some  e   the two year note was yield about      percent this morn  a new low for that secur  with the latest declin in yield coincid with the equiti market sell off   the most pronounc declin in yield sinc the middl of august occur in the five  and ten year area   the five year yield was at about      percent this morn  and the ten year yield was at about      percent   the explan for the sharp fall in yield are mani  though none by itself is fulli satisfi   market particip have cite a weak economi  although interest most forecast for third quarter gdp were rais in  recent week   poor busi sen ent was also cite  as were the corpor scandal  geopolit concern  and occasion rumor about problem at particular financi institut    howev  sinc the biggest move were in the middl of the curv  it would seem that mortgag hedg was in part the caus and in part an acceler of the sharp downward move in yield   as interest rate declin sinc decemb  the volum of mortgag refinanc increas  prepay shorten the durat of mortgag portfolio  and the quickest way for a portfolio manag to bring the portfolio durat into align was to buy noncal treasuri   those typic are in the five  and ten year sector   an ad factor in recent week has been the expect by mani market particip of increas hedg need of fanni mae  which last  week report a durat gap of minus fourteen month compar with it target of plus or minus six month   appar mani dealer and investor did some back of     the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix      the envelop calcul and conclud that fanni would need to buy a veri larg amount of treasuri to close the gap   while there is no evid that the govern sponsor entiti conduct ani such transact in the treasuri market  those who clever thought they would front run fanni may have ad to the buy wave   not surpris in this kind of market  volatil have been high  the mortgag hedg need show up in volatil measur as well   the market for option on swap is a key risk manag tool among investor in mortgag back secur   the bottom panel depict the mortgag banker associ refinanc index and the three month option on a ten year swap   impli volatil have risen to more than    percent along with the recent refinanc wave  as investor tri to stay ahead of the prepay cycl   let me turn to the corpor market on page     dure the summer the corpor bond market was one of reduc issuanc  wider spread relat to treasuri  wider bid offer spread  and general reduc liquid  make it difficult for investor to adjust the risk in their portfolio   in the intermeet period  the situat improv at the margin  but that improv was from some veri extrem condit  and sen ent in this market remain veri fragil   spread on invest grade debt narrow to about     basi point   still veri wide but better than earli august level   as shown in the top panel   issuanc has also pick up  as you can see in the middl panel  though the market have been veri discrimin about which compani have had access   condit in the secondari market have improv sinc your last meet   liquid is report better   and the veri wide bid offer spread revert to more normal level in the week or two after the last meet   the high yield sector show some sign of improv in mid august  as the equiti market ralli and the august    deadlin for certif pass   but in septemb  issuanc has been weak  and spread again are begin to widen  final  in the commerci paper market  there has been at least some stabil at lower level of issuanc   i would note that one market that has continu to function well is the asset back market  includ the market for asset back commerci paper   but even this develop suggest that investor are demand oblig that have an ad dose of protect   i think investor can be excus if they remain skittish   as one might expect after this year   s concern about account  corpor govern  and reduc earn prospect   and if they feel a bit burn by the corpor market   the bottom panel graph the month increment return that an investor has earn from corpor bond relat to treasuri of the same durat   in the earli to mid     s  the month increment return was about   basi point  with a standard deviat of about    basi point   sinc      that increment return has actual been minus    basi point   that is  the return on treasuri has been higher   and the standard deviat has more than doubl   in short  investor who have conclud that the corpor market has high risk and low return would not be out of bound  at least base on the experi of the past four year or so   turn to page    japanes equiti market have fluctuat wide as anoth fiscal period end approach   in the run up to march     almost six month ago  there was talk of a crisi in the bank system  given the declin in equiti price on the nikkei to below          in respons  the author impos a seri of rule chang on short sale  which trigger a sharp short cover ralli   last week the market had to absorb a differ surpris when the bank of japan announc that it would buy stock direct from the bank   the announc had a short live effect on the equiti market  though bank stock   the   line in the top panel   did bounc   the effect quick dissip sinc the market is wait to see what els  if anyth  will be done by the govern to clean up the bad debt situat   interest  the effect on the bond market so far has been more pronounc   the ten year jgb yield  shown in the middl left panel  was head toward   percent as gloom about japan   s prospect built up   over the past three trade session the yield shot up from about      to      percent  and this morn it was at about l    percent   the ironi is that in the near term the announc has not done veri much for stock but has advers affect jgb price  which itself is a major asset class for japanes bank    while the long end of the curv is back up  the short end is in demand  at least for the  e be  even at rate that are effect or actual at zero   the ministri of financ   s treasuri bill and financ bill auction have been stop out at about     basi point   now  you might think this would be an asset that would not be in much demand   but the bid to cover ratio in recent auction have been about     to   or     to    and in fact  it appear that about half the accept bid at recent auction were at par   that is  investor were incur the administr cost to buy the bill at no return rather than take the credit risk of just leav the money in a commerci bank   as for the bank themselv  they  too  have a lot of cash look for a home   the middl right panel show the growth of deposit sinc the earli     s and also the contract of loan dure that same period   with that much excess cash slosh around the market   and littl in the way of invest opportun   market particip expect the current environ to persist and  if anyth  see more of the yield curv get pull down toward zero   the bottom panel graph the current yield curv  the solid red line  along with two other snapshot   from one year ago and from eighteen month ago befor the bank of japan revert to it zero interest rate polici   the current two year yield is at about   basi point  and the middl of the curv is be tug lower by the weight of all that cash look for a home   as yet  howev  this strategi has not help to pull japan out of it period of stagnat   turn to euro area market briefli on page    the top panel graph the three month euro deposit libor rate  shown in black  and the three month  six month  and nine month forward rate of that same three month deposit   those forward rate  which earlier this summer had been trade at a premium to the cash rate are now trade about    basi point below it  despit word from the ecb suggest that it is veri comfort with the current stanc of polici   in part the same set of econom and polit factor that affect u s  expect are affect euro area rate   forecast for growth are reced quick  a fact that has also been reflect in equiti market   european stock index have fallen sharpli this summer   sinc june    the dow jone euro stock index   a broad index of major compani in the euro area  repres by the solid red line   has fallen more than    percent  includ declin ye day and today   the sector that has been hit hardest and led the declin is the insur sector   the dash red line   which has seen it market valu cut in half dure that  e   europ   s insur industri has been hit by loss not onli relat to the terrorist attack  the flood in europ  asbesto suit  and the like but also notabl by the sharp drop in equiti price and loss in their credit portfolio   one question that has been ask over the past year or two  as the level of default grew  was which balanc sheet were absorb these loss sinc few indic seem to be pop up with bank and secur hous   well  it has taken a while  but we final seem to be get some of the answer   just for comparison  the u s  insur sector has also seen it share clip   the dash blue line is the s p insur sub index  which fell about    percent over that period  about the same as the broader index   follow the pattern of the u s  and other major market  long term bond yield in the euro area have declin as well   the yield on the ten year bund to take one exampl   shown in the bottom panel   has fallen about    basi point sinc earli june  includ this morn   s price action   given the weak in major european economi  one might ask whi yield  which are still near    basi point abov compar u s  yield  did not drop even more   part of the reason might be the outsiz influenc of the mortgag market in the unit state  but part may also be relat to concern about backslid on stabil growth pact target by sever of the major euro area govern   final  let me say a word on reserv   the graph on page   show the growth of currenc over the past two year   dure that period  currenc grew most in a month rang of   to    percent  through june the growth rate fluctuat around    percent  which was abov longer term trend   sinc june  the month growth rate has fallen sharpli into the low singl digit and show littl sign of a turnaround  this has allow the desk to slow it outright purchas of treasuri secur and also to reduc the size of it long term repo book from about     billion this spring to about     billion now   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote for approv of the domest oper   and i   d be happi to answer ani question
you didn   t explain whi the currenc growth sudden disappear   is it intern
it   s both domest and intern
by our es   mr  chairman  the foreign hold of u s  currenc have fallen rather sharpli over the last coupl of month   just for background  in      and      foreign hold were grow at a clip of about   percent   our es  are that in juli their growth was around     percent  and then it slow to   percent in august and actual has contract in septemb thus far
is that becaus of argentina and brazil
in term of the direct  it   s a varieti of region
it   s everyth   it   s from a number of region  and there   s also a slow in the domest compon   realli  the growth in currenc is slow in all area
domest currenc growth is around   percent
do you have ani explan for that
the uncomfort one is that domest currenc is contemporan correl with spend
the question is  is it   no  let me put it this way   what is  the correl between currenc outstand and spend  let   s say  knock off the      bill which
the domest compon of currenc is correl with contemporan spend   the correl is not particular high though
i hesit to give you a number  but we certain will
unfair question  good answer
the last  e we had a middl ea n conflict  in the gulf war  i  think currenc went way up   is that right
the inflat rate was much higher then
actual  mr  chairman  in term of a staff model of currenc the r squar is around     and it   s high correl with nomin pce with a signific t statist
what is happen to corpor yield in japan   what do the spread look like   we veri rare hear discuss of that
it   s an excel question   and the problem at least in part is that the data are not great   what one hear are anecdot report
i   m just ask about price   do you mean the price are  not avail   you don   t have them
yes  but i think what peopl typic focus on is the cost of credit  which often is provid by the bank   so if the question is what is the cost of credit and the borrow is get credit from the bank  that inform is a littl harder to get   i don   t have the exact spread on the tip of my tongu
mr  chairman  i do
oh  do you   good
i have a chart of japanes corpor versus govern debt spread  the aa has been a littl choppi  but the spread is about    basi point  the bbb is around    basi point   both have been spiki  up and down a bit  in the last week or so
but the spread are not rise
there is no discern trend
the reason i rais the issu is that if there is a propens to hold jgbs for fear of privat credit risk  especi in the bank  one would have expect a veri signific open up of corpor yield   and i gather your chart  sn   t show that  unfortun  the japanes don   t have a secur market in the sens that
right   i can   t tell you what issuanc has been  so i have no idea if this is a reflect of no issuanc and no trade and so forth   actual  the spread has been trend down a bit in the bbb from the middl of this year to most recent   so there is no sign here that spread are blow up or even widen
i   ve tri to make a big point that the japanes don   t have  a secur market and that all of their intermedi is in bank   i guess it   s true     laughter  presid pool
i just want to offer a quick observ   you talk about the tremend oversubscript on the japanes treasuri secur despit littl or no yield on those invest   given that there   s an obvious altern  which would be u s  treasuri that have a posit yield  there must be an overwhelm view in japan that the yen if anyth is go to appreci  not depreci  against the dollar   otherwis one would think that there must be some import institut constraint or the japanes would be put money in europ or the unit state
i think the answer from all that i   ve seen   and i   ve look at this in consider detail   is that one cannot explain these yield differenti without advert to some notion of the equival of    buy american    in japan  where in a sens the presumpt is that one must support japanes institut   i say that becaus there   s just no credibl argument for these yield   well  mayb for the short term secur but not ten year jgbs   given the fiscal outlook and the demograph outlook
unless one is convinc that the yen is go to appreci over the long run against the dollar   otherwis it just  sn   t fit
yes  and that argument
it  sn   t make ani logic sens either
exact   so i conclud  mere as a fallback explan    have examin  la sherlock holm all of the altern and found them want   that therefor the miss altern must be the true one   but that is the type of reason that the logic cours will tell you is veri  veri fragil   presid jordan
thank you   dino  with regard to your refer to the possibl that the declin in longer term u s  treasuri yield is associ with fanni mae   s hedg need  i   ve seen that mention in the press too   i know noth about the flow through fanni mae  but the presumpt must be that the amount that they requir compar with the float stock is quit larg and   it   s sort of a tomato crop theori of bond price here   that fanni has to do someth els   i don   t know what the other balanc sheet entri are   what els do they do or  not do if in fact they do buy ten year treasuri to hedg
let me make two point  presid jordan   first  the commentari from the market was that generic mortgag hedg and hedg of mortgag back secur portfolio was associ with the declin in yield  which was one aspect of the stori   then in the last week  sinc fanni mae announc it durat gap  this other aspect aros  which was the expect that fanni mae itself would be jump into the hedg game   now  in talk with dealer  nobodi has seen ani of these flow   and fanni mae in other set has said that they realli don   t use treasuri in this way   there are other altern they could use to tri to bring down the durat gap   a step up in purchas of mortgag back secur  for exampl  or an acceler call of debt   short of actual do what peopl expect them to do   and fanni is fair sophist  enough so that they probabl would not do what everybodi expect
okay   but that still leav me a littl puzzl about how good of a hedg this is   except for the idea of callabl debt  which i hadn   t thought about as a cours of action they could take  what are the altern   if they had previous hedg  whether by use ten year treasuri or someth els  and we got this kind of declin in mortgag rate  then the hedg could work   the gain on the treasuri  if that   s what they hold  would compens them for their loss on the mortgag portfolio   but in their case it   s certain not appar to me that the invers is true   somebodi els  a mortgag bank compani  for exampl  can do that   if rate rise  they have a loss on their treasuri  and they have a gain on their mortgag portfolio   is that possibl with fanni mae   i can   t see them go out and say  we will take loss on our hedg portfolio and we   re go to sell someth els and take gain on it
i can   t speak for the interwork of how they manag their hedg    what  i was tri to do was to explain the commentari in the treasuri market   my point was that fanni mae has other mean of hedg   altern in term of accept the risk  which may have an impact on their earn if rate go the wrong way on them   so my messag was that the cours of action that was expect by some in the market and that was show up in wall street  journal articl was not necessarili the one they had to follow
i understand  but it still leav me uncomfort think that hedg activ by fanni mae work the same way as hedg activ by anybodi els   that   s not obvious to me  given the natur of what they would have to do if rate were to move substanti against them
that   s a possibl  yes
mr  chairman  you and presid pool partial answer the question  i want to ask   i was go to ask dino what his answer would be if his second cousin from texa call him and ask whi peopl in japan were will to go to the troubl to buy a bond with zero interest   i can see that there may be a patriot reason to keep the fund in japan or an exchang rate risk reason not to invest in asset of other countri   but what about the  altern of keep the money in a suitcas or a safe deposit box
well  i think some of that is go on as well  though perhap not as much as  in argentina where peopl have been buy safe   but certain we have heard some commentari about peopl keep cash as oppos to put it into a bank   let me make one other point regard your question about whi resid haven   t taken their money out of japan  there is a risk avers aspect relat to the fact that sever  e in the last ten year when money has start to flow out there have been exchang rate loss   the most promin case was in      when the exchang rate began to depreci rapid and the ministri of financ began interven aggress to cut off that avenu   they basic said we   re not go to let the yen depreci   as a consequ  there was a    yen swing the other way in a matter of day   that kind of experi is someth that stay with peopl  they rememb the pain  and that make them risk avers for the futur until that memori wane   so i think that   s anoth aspect that we shouldn   t overlook
but whi bond rather than liter hold cash in japan
well  i think in part there may be an avers to credit risk   earlier this year we were hear that one thing the japanes bank were do to fund their dollar asset was foreign exchang swap  swap u s  dollar for yen   they were do these trade with foreign bank  non japanes bank  which then had yen that they were rais effect at negat interest rate   so what one could then do was to invest at zero and still captur a posit margin   you would rather buy a bill at zero  let   s say  than put fund into a bank where you didn   t like the credit risk   so that was one class of action where it was ration and it made sens   there are other class i gather that i   m have a harder  e tri to explain
ani further question   vice chair
move approv of the domest oper
without object   we now move on to     and    son
thank you  mr  chairman   a year ago  as we gather here to discuss the outlook  we on the staff struggl mightili to make a use contribut to the econom analysi of the fallout from the unpreced terrorist attack that had just occur   for onc  the overus phrase of econom forecast everywher   that the uncertainti are unusu larg   was actual true   although we made an effort at the  e to present what we thought was a balanc forecast  it seem much easier for us to envis the downsid risk to that project   in the event  develop dure the past year have  at  e  remind me of cross the street in london  i   m often so focus on look to the left  that i don   t see the car come from the right that   s about to hit me   similar  amid all the concern rais by those terribl event  we simpli didn   t anticip the upturn in activ that was about to commenc   that upturn is now near a year old  and we see it continu as the most like outcom   but signific question still attach to the strength of this expans   on that score  much of the recent news has been on the posit side of our august project   in particular  the data on domest spend have been almost uniform stronger than our expect   the most strike exampl has been sale of new motor vehicl  which not onli didn   t retreat after the incent induc surg to    million unit at an annual rate in juli but actual increas still further in august to      million unit   even apart from motor vehicl  consum spend appear to be on track to post a solid gain   near   percent for the quarter  which is about    percentag point fa  than we had project last month   to be sure  the hous start figur for august came in a bit below our forecast   but permit edg up for the month  homebuild    survey remain quit posit  and there are few report that ani notic soften has occur   moreov  favor develop have not been confin to the household sector   read on shipment for juli suggest that outlay for equip like increas sharpli   inde  ad in the appar strength in transport equip  we are project a    percent annual rate increas in e s spend in the current quarter  more than twice the pace we had project in august   and those gain have been widespread  with spend in most major categori come in abov our expect   of cours  a few bleak spot remain in the busi spend pictur   outlay for communic equip have shown no sign of improv  and the overhang of vacant space continu to weigh heavili on the nonresidenti construct sector   taken togeth  privat domest final demand   that is  consumpt plus invest   are project to rise at a    percent annual rate in the current quarter  near     percentag point fa  than in our august forecast   we believ that some of that strength in sale is come out of inventori  and thus our upward revis to the growth of real gdp was a smaller    percentag point  bring the project increas in the current quarter to    percent   moreov  that upward adjust come on the heel of what we expect to be a similar size upward revis to the second quarter gdp figur to an annual pace of about     percent   despit these favor develop  we have carri none of that stronger near term growth forward in the forecast   rather  we have revis down the growth in real gdp over the next few quarter by enough to offset those upward revis  so that the level of output we are project for the fourth quarter of next year is about unchang from our previous forecast   in fact  we are expect growth in activ over the next four quarter to be littl differ from the pace of expans that we have experienc over the past four quarter   so  what give   there are sever reason whi we have made larg offset adjust to our forecast  despit the stronger incom read on real gdp   one reason is that the end of the inventori liquid   at least outsid of the motor vehicl sector   seem to have occur more quick than we had previous anticip  and thus the posit contribut to growth from the swing in inventori invest is not expect to be as larg go forward   a second reason is that we are skeptic that the recent strength in the order and shipment figur is yet signal a substanti acceler in capit outlay   the data are noisi  and we are expect a sizabl portion of the jump in juli to be revers over the next coupl of month   our es  for industri product of busi equip have not shown the degre of improv implicit in a liter read of the juli shipment figur   i   d also note that the ip measur for these categori line up reason well with the anecdot report we have receiv from busi   report that for the most part have remain lacklust   moreov  some of the recent surpris on equip spend has occur in busi purchas of motor vehicl and deliveri of aircraft  area where we expect outlay to drop back in the month immedi ahead   labor market develop also support a cautious approach to the recent spate of solid spend data   employ has been move sideway in recent month  and hour work have  on net  continu to drift down   the increas in initi claim  over the past few week might even suggest some deterior in labor market condit   current level of claim are more consist with small aggreg job loss than the small increas that we have incorpor in the forecast   we would have been less troubl by the recent behavior of the labor market if that was the onli signal of weak   after all  a drop in hour might be taken as just a sign of fa  growth of labor product   but the fact that the signal from the labor market seem to have been corrobor by weak in industri product has given us paus  factori output exclud motor vehicl has been flat sinc june   and that pattern seem consist with the survey of purchas manag  the discuss in the beig book  and the report we have receiv from our busi contact   although we do not read the recent data on the labor market and industri product as signal an impend return to contract in activ  we do believ that these develop constitut downsid risk to our project   one that counterbal the upsid risk associ with the recent strength in spend indic    our forecast now anticip that growth of real gdp will not move abov that of potenti until the second half of next year   the basic minus and pluse in the outlook remain much the same as they were in august   on the minus side of the ledger  household are expect to continu to restrain their spend in respons to the consider hit taken by the asset side of their balanc sheet   and we anticip that the general climat of caution pervad the busi environ will be worn away onli slowli as profit continu to recov and as overhang of unus capit are reduc   on the plus side  we believ that with real short term interest rate close to zero  monetari polici is set to facilit the process of balanc sheet repair  to s ul interest sensit spend  and eventu to contribut to abov trend growth as the factor restrain demand abat over the next year or so   an associ drop in the exchang valu of the dollar and further impetus to aggreg demand from the feder govern add to the pickup in activ that we believ will becom more visibl by late next year and into        onc again  in assembl this forecast  stronger spend data and weaker hour have confront us with the challeng of interpret anoth appar outsiz increas in labor product   we project an increas in nonfarm busi output per hour of about   percent in the current quarter   a figur which  if realiz  would bring the four quarter growth in labor product to about    percent   of cours  there are still plenti of miss data for the third quarter to prove us wrong  and  as we are remind everi summer  all of these figur should be view with some  suspicion befor they go through an annual revis   but even assum that there was a two standard deviat downward revis to product   and there is no reason to think a downward revis ani more like than an upward one   output per hour would still be up more than   percent over the past year   unlik the astonish   to   percent increas that we saw at the turn of the year  the more recent increas are almost certain not the result of busi be surpris by unexpect strength in demand   and as i note in the juli chart show  we don   t believ that an adjust cost stori  at least in it convent rendit  can be quantit larg enough to explain the upsw in product   one obvious explan for the perform of the past year is that structur product is grow more rapid than we are es    as you know  we did not make that our baselin interpret  but we do see it as a decid risk to our forecast   an altern simul that we includ in the  book show that fa  growth of structur product would boost project growth of real output  lower the unemploy rate  and put core inflat on a more pronounc downtrend   we think a more like explan is that firm  find their profit margin still under enorm pressur  are discov way to util exist resourc more intens   in some case  that may mean work their employe even harder than befor and harder than might be sustain over the longer haul   in other case  profit pressur may be forc organiz innov or effici enhanc   in still other  busi may be more fulli and effect util some of the resourc  especi capit equip  that they acquir dure the boom year   there are limit  of cours  to this process  which is ul  govern by the under rate of technic progress   the problem is that we don   t realli know where those limit are   in this forecast  we expect product to grow more slowli in the quarter ahead   but in contrast to some of our forecast earlier in the year  we do not expect ani revers in the recent gain  and we have held the level of product further abov our es  structur trend and for a longer period of  e than would be suggest by our model   we think this strike a reason balanc  but needless to say there are consider uncertainti here   an implic of this revis to our product forecast is that the labor market remain softer for longer than in our august project   we have also revis up our forecast of the unemploy rate  in part becaus of weaker prospect employ growth and in part becaus we have now assum that temporari extend unemploy compens will be continu through      rather than end in the middl of        all told  the unemploy

reflect the implic of our abov trend forecast for product and the effect of the unemploy insur program   should you be worri about that   i don   t think so  larg becaus over relat short period of  e     s law is obey with rough the same frequenc as a    mile an hour speed limit on the new jersey turnpik    laughter   with the unemploy rate remain well abov our es  of the natur rate  it might appear surpris that core consum price inflat fall onli a bit more than   percentag point over the forecast interv   but we think there are sever reason for onli a modest declin in under inflat go forward   first  as we discuss in juli  price inflat appear to be less sensit to resourc util in recent year than previous   second  the notic benefit that we were get earlier from the effect of a rise dollar on import price revers somewhat over the next two year   and final  the recent small upsid surpris on actual inflat and the approxim stabil of most measur of short term inflat expect suggest that there is like to be consider inertia around recent rate of inflat  taken togeth  these influenc lead us to expect declin in inflat through       but onli small declin     will now continu our present
the staff outlook for real econom activ in the rest of the world is slight darker than that we present in the august  book  as some of the recent data have fail to meet our expect and have disappoint market  in respons  we have revis down a bit our outlook for foreign real gdp   we still believ that the most like outcom will be that output growth abroad will general strengthen in       and we have now ad some further project acceler in        but downsid risk seem to predomin  and the rebound from global weak in      remain uneven and still a bit elus   the occas of the imf and world bank annual meet later this week prompt me to look back six month to their spring meet to assess how econom and financi develop over that interv compar with our expect at that  e and to look for factor at

character both the industri countri and the develop countri   not surpris  the actual cours of econom event was less smooth than that   foreign growth surpris us on the upsid in the first half of the year  particular for the industri countri   nevertheless  we now see real gdp growth in the industri countri in the second half of this year and the first half of next year as like to be weaker than in our march project and below that now report for the first half of this year    the reason behind our project of near term weak in the industri countri differ import for canada on the one hand  and for japan and the euro area on the other   in canada  real gdp growth dure the first half of the year was except vigor at an annual rate of more than   percent   growth at this pace is not sustain and pose the risk of trigger inflationari pressur if it were to continu   accord  the bank of canada has rais it polici rate    basi point sinc march   a pace of polici tighten that exceed what we had incorpor into the march  book   the effect of these higher rate on both consumpt and fix invest should becom evid over the next sever quarter   in addit  a swing in inventori behavior made a substanti contribut to growth in the first half  of this year but should prove to be transitori   final  the pattern of u s  real output growth is of particular import for canada   taken togeth  these factor paint a pictur of moder  rather than bli   growth in the near term that continu over the forecast period   in contrast  japan and the euro area both appear to have experienc some good fortun in the first half of this year after negat real gdp growth in the fourth quarter of last year   but both have as yet fail to develop ani momentum that would sustain demand and lead to a firm of recoveri   in japan  doubl digit export growth more than account for the rebound in real gdp over the first half  as domest demand again contract on balanc   much of the increas in export was to other economi in asia  and we do not see the scope for export growth to continu at it recent pace   given the ongo problem in japan of financi sector weak  monetari and fiscal polici inact  and moder deflat  we expect that domest demand will not expand enough to result in anyth other than weak growth over the forecast period   in the euro area  the expans in the first half was the result of improv net export and a boost from reduc inventori liquid   in our forecast  we have these factor continu to contribut  albeit at a reduc rate  along with some  rebound in final domest demand to yield relat weak real gdp growth for the next sever quarter   subsequ  acceler in fix invest and consumpt should boost growth to between     and   percent dure the second half of next year   the continu listless perform of the german economi is a major factor behind the subpar outlook for the euro area   declin equiti price and global financi market volatil over the past sever month have undermin busi and consum confid in the euro area   german stock price have fallen further over the intermeet period as european insur compani  in particular  have been hit hard by portfolio loss and high claim   with output growth in

will firm by the middl of next year but recogn that current there seem to be littl upsid risk for such a forecast   among the develop countri  the emerg economi in asia and mexico are project to show strength and to experi a return to vigor growth by the end of the forecast period  although the pattern is expect to differ across these countri  elsewher in latin america  financi and polit stress

the next few quarter be weaker than we now expect   similar  our forecast that the recent bounceback in mexican output will prove durabl is especi depend on the path of output and demand in the unit state   overal  the slight gloomier tone to the staff outlook this  e   not aris from a judgment that the global high risk spot  such as brazil  are now more like to experi sever crise or to caus greater spillov effect on other countri  rather  it is that  among the major foreign industri countri  onli canada has experienc a robust recoveri   the failur to date of the euro area and of japan to move beyond sluggish growth to a pace that reduc excess capac and trigger a reviv of invest spend is reflect in the small downward revis that we made to our project for near term foreign growth  and

question   presid broaddus
i have a question for     the staff forecast certain seem reason to me     but obvious there are alway risk of error on both side of a forecast such as this   in that context  i alway find the altern scenario provid in the  book help and use to think through   with that in mind  i would ask  have you consid an altern scenario that combin  sever of the downsid risk cover in your simul or mayb even add a coupl   one could think of a situat where invest remain weak  hous activ stop  and there is heighten fear of a terrorist attack becaus of some event somewher in the world that keep consum out of shop for a while   one could perhap add in for good measur a further slump in the stock market   what i   m tri to get at here is  what kind of condit would be requir to push us into a deflationari situat   and if we were confront with such a situat  how persist would that be and how respons would it be to the polici action we might take
let me make a coupl of remark on your point   obvious  we can construct consider grimmer scenario than the one we present in the  book   and as i think we   ve mention on a coupl of occas  that is an area of research we   re work on  one of the weak in the altern scenario that we present to you is that we would like to  consid the covari of the possibl of these scenario in way we think this type of analysi   not adequ captur   so  the thrust of your concern is a good one  and it   s one that i think we need to address better go forward  we have run stochast simul of the model use our baselin forecast to look at the probabl that we would hit the zero bound   i think this move in the direct you   re suggest   in those scenario  depend on how we character the monetari polici reaction function   and  again  those scenario depend import on that specif   we come up with a probabl of between    and    percent of run into that zero bound over the forecast period   that is notic   obvious  given the confid interv on the forecast go out  it probabl shouldn   t be too surpris that there would be the possibl of a seri of bad shock that would lead to that situat   it certain isn   t trivial in my view
incident  am i correct that there has been a fair signific increas in corpor liquid in the last year or so
yes  corpor have been take advantag of what has been a recept bond market to acquir a lot of liquid asset and in fact have a lot of liquid asset on their book
there   s been a gross up in a sens
is it basic long term liabil and short term asset  as best we can judg
yes  we   ve seen an increas in both   as i think we show ye day in the staff brief  the ratio of liquid asset to total asset has increas in the corpor sector over the past year or so
so that can be read in one of two way or perhap even in two way   one is that it is a measur of the extent to which caution has confront the busi communiti in the last year and they are feel vulner  which is the other side of pull back on capit expenditur   on the other hand  corpor have the cash avail to use in the event they need it   so we may have a signific increas in the financ gap  but it could veri readili be accommod disproportion from a reduct in liquid balanc as distinct from further increas in debt
yes  i would agre that that   s the general pictur we see current  the weak in borrow has been larg demand driven  not a suppli constraint   better corpor credit can go to the market and rais fund   they have been do that  presum in some sens to protect themselv against market that might turn less recept in the futur   but the weak in borrow also reflect the fact that corpor have accumul these asset becaus they have not been do a signific amount of invest   inde have been liquid inventori   and reduc the demand for those credit
thank you  mr  chairman   it   s a comfort to me to know that al broaddus is worri about deflat becaus it mean that i   m free not to give it much thought   laughter   i want to ask   a question about canada and how much we realli know about the current situat as a basi for the staff forecast   in your staff   s pre fomc brief to the board ye day there was a comment in the text that the hous market in canada is expect to slow   and there   s a chart in your materi that depict the spike in hous start and employ this year   but canada   s popul is less than that of california   canada has had an increas of a half million in employ and        in hous start in a year   do we have current  reason reliabl inform on what has happen dure the last year to their legal and illeg immigr  especi as we make it more difficult to get into this countri   i know that the ferri run from kingsvill to sanduski alway use to be complet full go in one direct and none of the passeng spoke english  but immigr via that rout is be control for the first  e in my memori   do we know anyth about what is go on up there
to be honest  i don   t   i sincer hope that there are mani peopl who for other reason are pay a lot of attent to immigr control in canada   but it is not someth that has been rais in the context of the econom debat about the reason that canada has led the way in this recoveri   they have had a hous boom in term of hous price and hous start   and part of the stori is that they have had an auto boom that is  i   m sure  to some extent a part of and deriv from the u s  auto boom   they have not had the same degre of capit overhang that we have experienc  and for that reason they see themselv as have a recoveri that has fewer headwind   in realiti they have been out in front of us   i wouldn   t rule out the thought that immigr has someth to do with it   i just honest don   t have an answer for you
i have a question for you     about the discuss on product in your remark today and also the altern scenario with fa  product growth includ in the  book   you talk about two possibl explan for this extraordinari growth in product   one is that structur product has increas  and you deal with that in the altern scenario   the second is that employ have employe work harder  and i think you ad organiz effici to that as well   some research we   ve done in chicago would suggest that if employ are have employe work harder  employe also are go to be work longer hour   but  of cours  as you said  the hour work have been drift down  and over  hasn   t increas signific   so i   m just wonder how you reconcil those fact with this favor explan of the higher increas in product growth
first  let me say that i wouldn   t necessarili character it as a favor explan   in fact one of the way that i mention in which busi could be get more output out of their exist resourc is that they actual are learn how to use the equip that they current have avail to them   the capit overhang may be allow busi to rais output without ad a signific number of worker becaus they are use their equip more effici   so it isn   t just the employe margin   you   re right  certain  in suggest that the flat in the workweek is not consist with work employe harder  don   t forget  though  that the workweek that we measur and that we know anyth about involv just product worker hour   one can certain imagin in the servic economi that some of the effici have been achiev by cut out white collar  middl manag type  whose workweek is not measur in our employ survey  and work the remain manag longer hour   so some of that could be go on as well   that   s the onli way to reconcil the two becaus  as you point out  there is a tension between the product worker workweek and what we   re actual see in product   my guess is that a few of these thing actual are go on in differ sector and in differ area   some may involv more effici use of capit and some may just reflect work worker harder   the point would be in some sens that one couldn   t look at the recent behavior of product and necessarili expect it to continu indefinit at that pace becaus take up slack in overal resourc util is one of the way in which these gain are be achiev
thank you  mr  chairman   dave  when i read the  book one of the thing that struck me was how littl inflat is project to declin over the period   i appreci your take the  e to explain whi that is the case   but it seem to me that over a two year period a more convent rule of thumb   along the line of what would come out from a phillip curv analysi   would have the inflat rate go down mayb not to where al was talk about but close to    percent   the chanc of that happen  sn   t seem to me to be small   i believ that there is some signific probabl that it could occur   did you think in term of what the chanc were that some more tradit relationship could reassert  themselv and how signific that might be
obvious  there are mani differ es  phillip curv   our forecast actual is reason consist with our es  of the phillip curv   our at least has a relat small coeffici on that gap variabl   so i don   t think we view this forecast as necessarili at odd with our es  relationship   as i indic  we think we   re alreadi see some signific swing in import price  they had been declin about   percent in       and we think they are like to be rise about   percent by some  e next year   that   s a swing of   percentag point   we don   t see a lot of eros in short term inflat expect  and long term inflat expect have come down onli some   so there could be some risk of a more signific break on the inflat expect side that would allow inflat to come down more sharpli   know how sensit the result of those model are to specif  i certain wouldn   t want to rule out the kind of figur that you cite   we get number like that  for exampl  in phillip curv that use capac util rather than the unemploy rate  and there   s not a lot to differenti model that use those two variabl measur   and as you point out  rule of thumb base on past phillip curv experi would suggest a more pronounc downdrift in inflat than we   re show here
i was go to ask you whi canada has done so well in term of econom growth and if you thought that the relat long term declin in the canadian dollar  rate was a primari factor   i don   t believ you mention that in respond to jerri earlier
no  and i think that is a good point   i appreci your mention it  the industri countri that on the whole did the best through the recent downturn and the upturn is australia   i   ve ask myself over and over again whi it is that australia has done so well  and now in term of the recoveri  canada is come right behind them as an economi that is outpac our and outpac those of all the other industri countri   some peopl when they talk about both of those countri  but main canada  point to the fact that their export in particular are commod base   but it goe against everyth i think i understand about the global economi to believ that dure a downturn those economi would fare better rather than wors  they typic are hit harder as manufactur fall elsewher  there   s an acceler effect on the demand for their export   it usual make them more vulner rather than less  but both australia and canada are economi that have had substanti currenc depreci  they have allow that to happen   have not resist it by tighten monetari polici   and have not suffer particular on the inflat front as a consequ for a host of reason that we   ve talk about befor   we   ve discuss  for exampl  whether the global economi is more competit and so forth and whether inflat target per se has help to make that happen  they have enjoy some relat price advantag   canada is an energi export  or at least self suffici in that regard  and that may help to some degre in this environ as well
this lead you to believ that we could use a littl more currenc  depreci ourselv
well  i   m alway the one who is sit around worri about the current account deficit and our net extern indebted   it   s not that i don   t think the u s  economi can be maintain at full util of it resourc either way   but i think that in the long run some dollar depreci is a necessari step  so i don   t regret it when it come along  i am skeptic that the canadian  becaus they are the tail and not the dog of north america so to speak  can sustain such strong growth ani more than mexico can sustain strong growth when the u s  economi is not perform well   so for those reason we do expect to see the canadian economi conform more to other industri economi and experienc growth closer to their long term averag  more along the line of what our is do  i will say that one bank of canada analyst whisper the word    product    in my ear not too long ago   and i have suggest to some of our peopl that we look to see if we can find some answer there becaus that is the one area we thought the u s  experi might most readili be replic in canada   so mayb they are begin to experi the initi stage of some of the develop that occur in the u s  economi three or four year ago   no doubt it   s a mixtur of all these thing   some exchang rate depreci  some success in get their inflat rate down  a hous boom  an auto boom  and in general a work out of the inventori cycl and less perceiv overhang of capit   that togeth add up to the stronger canadian perform
presid  n
thank you   dave  you mention along the way that the initi claim data seem more consist with small declin in employ rather than small increas  and yet you   ve maintain the small increas in the  book forecast   could you give me a sens  of your think that has led to that more op ist conclus
sure   one factor was that when we put the  book to bed we had onli one week of initi claim at            laughter   claim data are volatil enough that we just didn   t take serious that one week   s data   now  that level was sustain last week   there was an old rule of thumb in the divis that we had to see at least three success week of evid in the data befor we took it serious   i don   t know if that   s quit the right number of week  but at this point  if that level of initi claim were sustain go forward or rose even further  i think we would have to revis our employ forecast

thank you  mr  chairman   after listen to all kind of peopl over  the summer  i   ve come to the conclus that perhap i should alway listen to equal number of manufactur and retire becaus manufactur alway want lower rate and retire alway want higher rate   or mayb better yet  i should just save myself some  e and not listen to either group  most report from our director indic that not much has chang recent   that   s similar to what     was say about his district onli i didn   t sens that the tone among our director was quit as negat as i thought   was suggest for his   to me  neither report of strength nor report of weak tend to domin   but let me note just a few thing i heard from director   a fresh report on the coal industri in the region indic a stronger demand than had been anticip earlier  which is due primarili to higher coal consumpt by power plant  that busi has been veri good   the strength i mention in the spring in busi at roadsid hotel chain and famili style restaur continu through the summer  as did the weak in urban center hotel chain   employ of union truck driver was report to have continu to increas in spite of the bankruptci of consolid freight compani   and sale at the annual septemb auction of thoroughbr in kentucki were even wors than the juli auction of colt   we were told that dollar sale were down    percent  and it was primarili becaus middl east buyer didn   t show up this  e   at a recent meet of our communiti bank advisori council  sever member describ their busi custom as be high liquid   these custom had line of credit in place  and they had attract invest opportun   they simpli lack the confid to proceed   as one banker put it     small busi are healthi but afraid     on the nation economi  i want to comment about some cyclic versus secular trend  a former member of our small busi advisori council who run a metal fabric compani near lexington  kentucki  attend a joint board of director dinner where governor olson spoke on septemb  l   actual we were in covington  kentucki  so there were a lot of refer to what it was like over half a centuri ago when the chairman play with a band there   in fact  it was pretti excit
i don   t know if i should admit to this  but in the back room there were veri peculiar thing go on    laughter
so we heard   as for his view on the economi  this small businessman describ it as    saw tooth with a posit bias      that   s just the way they talk in kentucki  i think   the saw teeth are obvious in the month to month chang that are regular report   but ascertain whether or not there is a posit cyclic trend has becom especi difficult for two reason   one reason is that we   re now in a period where year over year comparison are wors than useless   they are high mislead   for exampl  peopl in this room know that  if i were to say that dure the most recent reserv settlement period end on septemb    there was a    percent drop in nonborrow reserv from a year earlier  all of you would know that that is useless inform   of cours there was  and we know whi   but compar a period with the same period a year earlier is the way a lot of data such as retail sale  corpor earn  and so forth are report   that is not go to tell us anyth  and it may mislead a lot of peopl   for exampl  when we get the octob car sale figur  the headlin number is go to be report as the biggest month drop in the histori of the seri   that   s pretti useless inform  secular trend also are hard for peopl to filter out   when the august employ figur were releas  our director conclud that the continu weak in manufactur employ suggest that the expans was not on firm ground   but manufactur employ was weak throughout most of the ten year long expans of the     s   at the end of that expans     million more peopl were work than at the end of the prior expans  but manufactur employ was down         on balanc over the ten year period   and even if one assign a signific share of the help suppli employ to manufactur  it was still a weak perform   break it down  durabl good employ was report to have risen         over the ten year while nondur good manufactur fell by         over a decad of econom boom   and that   s probabl an understat   the chairman of our board also sit on the board of hamilton beach  which i assum still has an sic code of a small manufactur of applianc   but hamilton beach has not made ani invest in ani facil that manufactur anyth in over a decad   all the item that are sit on the shelv of wal mart with a hamilton beach label on them are bought from contract manufactur  someplac in the world  the point is that there are power secular trend stem from this continu global of the economi that are alter the profil of our nation economi   they were do so befor the cyclic contract  and they will continu to do so dure an econom upturn   in fact  these forc are just as like to strengthen as to abat dure a cyclic upturn  we will have to look elsewher for confirm of ani kind of posit bias to the pattern of the saw teeth  final  regard dave     s open comment   if a year ago at this  e dave had not onli anticip the subsequ shock but then went on to forecast accur what actual has happen over these past twelv month  i suspect it would have seem simpli not credibl  even given our post septemb    polici action   the point is that the u s  economi over these past twelv month has perform much  much better than anyon had ani reason right to expect  which is a testament to the inher resili of a market economi   and that   s veri import to keep in mind   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the southeast has  continu to advanc at a lacklust pace sinc our last meet   and it   s my sens from convers with busi communiti leader that we have lost some of the momentum and  cautious op  that we were see earlier in the year   consum spend is show the same pattern that it has at the nation level   home sale and residenti construct remain strong in most of our market  yet there are continu report  especi from the chairman of my board  of grow soft in higher price home   also like the nation  auto sale remain veri strong  given the reinstat of incent   retail sale of nondur good rose onli modest across the region in august  and back to school sale were report to have been soft and disappoint  state budget are feel the pinch of tax receipt that are run below forecast  leisur travel to resort area in the district has improv slowli  support primarili by drive  travel   but busi travel and relat convent busi  which is import to mani of our major citi  has been weak and continu to disappoint   busi spend remain subdu  with the except of our grow and vigor southern auto industri  manufactur appear to have lost some momentum as well   almost ani postpon expenditur is still be defer  and busi are not ad signific to payrol   the larg intern temporari employ compani headquart in atlanta tell us that the growth in temporari employ demand that was show some  pickup in the spring and earli summer has plateau   and there has not yet been ani signific sign of employ want to convert temp to perman hire  a clear identifi stage in an employ rebound which that compani say was evid in past recoveri  probabl the weakest sector in our southeast region is commerci real estat   that market is essenti dead in the water  and larg contractor who do the bulk of this work report that there are not even ani earli convers with busi about new project   inquiri further back in the construct food chain   to architect in our area   brought the same report  even new public project fund by state and local govern seem to be dri up as current work is complet  reflect the grow pressur on state and local budget  consum lend continu to outpac commerci loan demand   while we   re hear mix report on consum bankruptci and default  data be share with us by the larg credit report compani  equifax  suggest that debt servic burden have come down over the past year  especi for those in the highest incom class   consist with this observ  our bank examin report that consum credit qualiti at district bank is either hold or improv  with no signific surpris   somewhat contradictori to that inform  we   ve receiv sever recent report  includ some from particip at our small busi advisori  council meet last week  of slower payment on account   while some of that deterior appear to be at the consum level  most report seem relat to trade credit where compani  especi larg compani  are stretch out their payment  at the nation level  we interpret the new data sinc our last meet as decid mix  not offer ani new encourag of grow momentum over the near term but perhap suggest that the downsid risk that we were concern about six week ago have abat at least somewhat   at the same  e i judg uncertainti to have increas  and the consequ of a possibl war with iraq have certain contribut to that   as solid recoveri get push further out in  e  mani are express grow frustrat and impati   with few sign of signific increas in capit spend and employ over the near term  my own view is that the path of the economi over the next sever quarter may well be a bit below that trace out in the  book   the more i learn about the extraordinari capac yet to be work out of the telecom industri   and the now more appar structur problem in the airlin industri that go well beyond the septemb    effect  the even longer delay rebound in commerci construct  and other various excess and imbal that are be work through   the harder it is for me to expect a big  near term upsid surpris   have said that  i still urg us to be patient while those correct get made   as i   ve suggest befor  further cut in rate could onli delay those chang and slow the ul  recoveri   in fact  it seem to me that the veri low  below long term equilibrium  interest rate that have been in effect for a long while now may have contribut to the develop of some of the excess   moreov  the low rate may alreadi be slow the adjust process and could be help to creat still new imbal   a number of observ of the massiv overcapac in the telecom sector trace some of those excess to the readi avail of low cost capit that encourag even fring and upstart telecom supplier and servic provid to invest well beyond ani sustain level of capac   my commerci real estat friend tell me that the commerci real estat oversuppli is adjust less rapid than would be the case if carri cost on margin properti were not so low   and the now histor low borrow rate on home and auto may be encourag various player in those sector to develop unrealist expect about a sustain level of activ  although i would not yet character price develop in hous as a general hous bubbl  i   m hear more and more report of what might be character as pure specul hous and properti deal  most in florida   these deal are all driven by claim  that sound as if the properti can be resold in a few month or a few year at a nice profit so at current interest rate how can one pass up such an opportun   of cours  there   s a bit of a catch    in that these slow adjust induc by low interest rate have serv to sustain some measur of stabil as the economi work through other adjust   while i   m certain not suggest that we consid ani polici tighten at this meet  i do think we may alreadi  be in a bit of a polici trap   i recogn that some downsid risk remain  includ some  potenti larg and negat shock  but i do not think we should exacerb our long term problem with still lower interest rate unless the downsid risk loom larger or the negat shock are realiz   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   at our last meet in august  i report that the recoveri in the third district appear to be slow from the pace seen earlier in the year   incom data reinforc this assess   although auto sale in the region remain robust  retail sale of general merchandis slip from juli to august   some merchant remark that the long spell of hot weather damp sale of fall merchandis  especi apparel  retail tell us that their outlook for sale over the balanc of the year is uncertain  so they   re be cautious about their inventori plan   consum spend on tourism and relat activ has been below last year   s level in each of our three state   while day trip number this summer were higher than last year  overnight stay and spend per visitor were down  result in less busi at most vacat area   residenti real estat activ also appear to be moder but from relat high level   hous permit issuanc has move up this year  but builder contact in august said their new home sale had slow a bit   residenti real estat agent report that sale of exist home also slow in juli and august but that the rate of sale remain high by histor standard and price appreci continu at a rapid rate  commerci real estat market have remain soft   although there has been onli a small increas in the metropolitan philadelphia area vacanc rate from the first to the second quarter  rent concess have becom more common and more generous   the valu of nonresidenti construct contract award in the region has fallen sinc spring when the total was boost by contract for casino  offic  and educ build   our contact in commerci real estat say they expect some improv but probabl not until next year  loan volum in third district bank have been flat to down in recent week  as strong growth in residenti real estat loan has been offset by declin in busi lend  labor market in the district have stabil   after declin in the first and second quarter  employ in our three state was flat in the first two month of the third quarter   the tri state unemploy rate remain below that of the nation   averag     percent in the first two month of the third quarter  down from     percent in the second quarter  activ in the region   s manufactur sector paus this summer   in august our  busi outlook survey index of general activ dip into negat territori for the first  e sinc last decemb   the index strengthen slight in septemb  return to posit territori with a read of plus      a level that is consist with not much chang in region manufactur activ this month   our index has a reason good track record in predict nation industri activ  so the modest rebound suggest that recent declin in manufactur activ in the district and perhap in the nation may have abat  in septemb the index on new order and shipment also move back into posit  territori   we also saw some improv in capit spend plan over the next six month  this index rose from about   percent in august to about      percent in septemb  which is somewhat closer to the rang of read normal record in expansionari period   as a summari measur  our index of current econom activ are indic slight  posit growth in the three state  third district condit appear similar to those in the rest of the nation   in my assess  the econom recoveri continu at the nation level but at a slower pace than earlier in the year   the real issu is that the recoveri has yet to develop ani kind of traction to help it build momentum   it is look veri much like the so call jobless recoveri of          inde  in term of job growth  this recoveri has gotten off to the second slowest start in ani postwar recoveri   this part reflect the fact that the servic sector has becom a much larger portion of total payrol employ  and job growth in that industri is normal weak in the earli stage of a recoveri   but in both      and      the recoveri in servic employ has been even weaker than averag   in      the financi headwind includ job loss in financ  this  e the shock of septemb    and the collaps of the tech bubbl have advers affect the broad servic sector  includ airlin and travel  telecom  and it  as well as the financi sector  two other similar to      are the sharp declin in busi and consum sen ent   although not to the level of        and the concern that the recoveri may be stall  you may recal that by decemb      the  book had forecast two slight negat quarter base upon a veri negat novemb employ report  which was later revis  today  we face the linger effect of septemb    on the nation psych  the aftermath of the burst tech bubbl  the negat reaction and ad uncertainti center around corpor account scandal  and increas anxieti over the possibl of war with iraq   these are just some of the headwind that our economi must fight through   nonetheless  there are offset to the headwind  not the least of which are accommod monetari and fiscal polici   low interest rate are sustain consum spend on hous and durabl  which is an essenti part of the outlook   and some categori of invest spend are begin to post increas  overal econom growth this year is expect to averag around   percent  although the risk remain  as mani have note  weight toward the downsid  the question today is whether more s ulus is need now or whether patienc is a virtu   my prefer is to give the current accommod polici more  e to work   i don   t want to rule out a rate cut in the futur  but in my opinion at this point we don   t have suffici evid for one   thank you  mr  chairman

stronger than a year ago  turn to the nation  i   ve been struck by what seem to me to be two mark chang in incom data and sen ent sinc our last meet   at that meet i was concern about the impact that negat financi condit were have on the prospect for a continu recoveri  and i was concern about whether or not monetari polici was accommod enough to act as a balanc to those headwind   these financi market condit seem to eas a bit after  august      incom data on durabl good order and shipment  retail sale   especi for auto but in other area as well   home sale and permit as well as the perhap fluki drop in unemploy seem to point to firmer prospect for growth   then as geopolit fear grew  even after an unev day of remembr on septemb     market volatil increas with new round of investig of corpor wrongdo   incom data on unemploy claim  purchas manag    sen ent  industri product  and an expect drop in motor vehicl sale seem to signal that growth prospect had dim more than a bit  all of us who have been speak dure this intermeet period have comment on the bump in the road to recoveri   current those bump seem particular larg  at least to me  reflect these shift sand  our forecast  assum an unchang feder fund rate  has weaken a bit for the last quarter of this year and for        we now see q  over q  growth in      at     percent and at   percent in        this is a bit below our es  of potenti in both year  so we see unemploy move up to     percent by the end of      and inflat move down  these headlin number don   t differ a lot from the project in the  book  but frank i find both of these forecast a bit worrisom   they suggest that three year of below potenti growth  no progress in reduc unemploy  and fall inflat repres an outcom with which we might be comfort enough to leav polici unchang   moreov  all of these forecast reflect  at least in my view  the best case   downsid risk predomin  and peopl have talk about them   just to name a few   will consum stay the cours on spend if job growth  sn   t acceler   will technolog spend turn the corner ani  e soon  given slow to moder growth here and abroad and plenti of excess capac   and i have to say that the increas risk of a war with iraq and continu turmoil around issu have to do with corpor govern suggest that equiti market risk abound    it is true that polici may be pois to address at least some of these risk   low interest rate buoy the consum as do tax cut   chang in tax incent may help boost lacklust busi spend at some point   but unless good reason to invest emerg  it is hard to believ that tax incent  or for that matter lower interest rate  will drive spend all by themselv  product growth remain strong  though that has exacerb the jobless of this recoveri  the economi may in fact heal itself  as the  book suggest  without further polici s ulus   but i think there is at least some reason to believ that that won   t happen ani  e soon   now  it   s possibl that lower interest rate now could have unforeseen consequ   not just in term of inflationari growth over the longer term but in the natur of the bet be taken in financi market and perhap in real estat market as well   along the line refer to by presid guynn   and it is also true that if a war on iraq or some other as yet unrev corpor malfeas produc some untoward econom respons  we will need a bit of ammunit to work with   these may well be reason to hold off   but in my view the polici choic isn   t easi   my person prefer would be for polici that encourag stronger growth in this environ of even lower project inflat  though i would agre that such a stanc is not without it own risk
thank you  mr  chairman   the first sentenc of the beig book summari say that econom activ has slow in most district but with consider variat across sector of the economi   that describ my district veri well   on the weak side  just to give you a bit of the detail  manufactur activ has clear soften appreci late   that includ the furnitur industri  a fact that is a bit disappoint becaus one might think it would be s ul to some extent by the continu strength in new home construct and sale   i spoke to the ceo of one of the larger north  ina furnitur compani  and his theori is that younger famili are stretch so hard to pay the elev price for new home that onc they move in they have to sleep on the floor    laughter   the other realli weak sector in the district is agricultur   of cours  we   re not the nation   s breadbasket  but like you folk in the kansa citi district and elsewher in the midsect of the countri  tom  our farmer are suffer mightili from the sever drought we   ve had on the east coast   those are the comment i would make regard the weak side  on the brighter side  as i suggest earlier  hous activ is still quit robust across our region   ditto for new car sale   it seem as if all the reserv bank met with their small busi council in the last coupl of week  and we did too   i had at least one favor report out of that meet   one of our member report that a power tool compani that had earlier move a plant from south  ina to mexico recent had move it back to south  ina   my council member specul that this was becaus most of the mexican workforc has now move to the unit state and a lot of them are live in south  ina    laughter   serious  with respect to the sector that are perhap most problemat for the nation outlook  despit the weak in manufactur we do hear some report of a gradual pickup in capit spend   but my sens is that most of this involv equip replac  driven by the shorter use live of much of today   s equip and the tax incent that were introduc earlier in the year   it  sn   t seem to us to reflect ani signific  increas op  among busi peopl about the near term and intermedi term outlook   and final on the district  our labor market remain general soft pretti much across the region   so we see a mix pictur in our region overal  lean on balanc to the weak side for the moment  with respect to the nation outlook  person i am reason comfort with the  book forecast   i believ it   s plausibl and  frank  while it   s not a roar forecast  under the circumst i think it would not be a bad outcom if it materi   but as i said earlier when i ask that question of    as alway there are risk in the project on both the upsid and the downsid   of cours  most of the focus current is on the downsid risk  and i   ll come back to that   i would say  though  just to cover the full rang of possibl  that i think   and i guess i differ with jack guynn a littl on this   there is still some potenti for an upsid surpris given what in my view is an accommod current polici stanc   of cours  that is recogn in a coupl of the altern scenario you put out      and a number of jerri jordan   s comment reson with me   i think there   s an upsid possibl  what seem to be damp the recoveri now is a quit pervas caution in the busi sector   firm are reluct to make commit for fear that a sustain expans is not go to take hold and becaus of the uncertainti regard iraq   but if growth pick up as the  book project  this caution and the headwind it creat could dissip   the point i would make here is that it could dissip fair quick at some point in a manner similar to what occur in the latter part of      and earli        in that event we would need to react prompt  and preemptiv as we did in        i believ we would do that   so unlik my concern in the past  i think we   re pretti well cover on the upsid at least for now  again though  as sever peopl have point out  most of the focus now   seem to be on the downsid risk   that certain seem to be the sens of the major of comment around the tabl this morn  and it was the sens at our last meet when we move to the tilt toward weak in our statement   broad  my view is that our current stanc  which again i think is quit accommod  is suffici to handl what i would term garden varieti downsid risk  like persist longer than expect busi caution  somewhat weaker than anticip consum spend  or perhap a moder deceler in hous activ   what worri me    and this will realli make you comfort  jerri   is a veri serious downsid scenario featur a sharp further drop in household and busi confid and spend and a credibl threat of deflat that will bring us face to face with the zero bound  let me just add a quick footnot on that   we discuss this issu at length in our special  topic session in januari   i thought it was a veri good and complet discuss   i didn   t have the sens  though  that we reach much  if ani  consensus regard how we would respond in practic  oper  if such a situat emerg   it appear to me that current the feder reserv is quit appropri do extens conting plan with respect to a number of our oper around the system   iron  i   m not at all sure that this committe is fulli prepar to deal with a zero bound conting if we   re sudden confront by it   and that strike me as a fair glare omiss in the system   s overal current conting plan   i don   t know exact the best way to tackl this problem  but in general it seem to me that we should perhap consid bring togeth the right peopl to review the option we have if a situat like this aris   i think we laid those option out pretti well in the discuss in januari   i would like to see us determin what the most credibl option would be and then have that group help us think a bit about how we would implement some of these option if we were sudden in a posit to have to do that   thank you

thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be brief becaus in my view veri littl has chang on balanc sinc our discuss at the last meet   as far as the district economi is concern  perhap one way to character it is to distinguish between the consum and busi sector   the consum sector continu pretti much as we have been discuss around the tabl for a good number of month now   spend at retail has been strong   auto  of cours  have done veri well   and tourism activ has been good   hous continu to do well  and home improv spend is anoth notabl bright spot  the agricultur sector has pick up in mani part of the district where the drought has been allevi   problem still persist in a few place  but geograph the drought area has diminish  so in fact agricultur is do a littl better   and base on anecdot report  it appear that the labor market is show a few more sign of activ across a broader rang of job opportun  so that   s a plus   on the other hand  in manufactur and relat busi  activ is pretti quiet  as it has been for some  e   littl has chang there  as far as the nation is concern  i guess it   s repetiti to say  but i think an economi with modest growth and low inflat is the most like outcom and an accept one   we ran the incom month and quarter data through our var forecast model  and it produc basic the same forecast for this meet that it did for the previous meet   i take that to mean that the model didn   t interpret the incom data as provid ani larg surpris or that  ani surpris were offset   my point is that the outlook  sn   t seem to have chang veri much base on what has happen over the intermeet period  i do continu to think that a signific and broad base expans in busi spend is probabl still some  e off   there has been some discuss  of cours  of the jobless recoveri  and that is not a prefer outcom   howev  if we look back at          as i recal   depend on exact how one interpret the data   it took a year and mayb as much as two year befor we saw some realli signific and sustain increas in employ  nevertheless  that expans turn out to be a veri long live and healthi one   one observ  of cours   sn   t make a trend  so i don   t think we ought to draw too mani conclus from that except to say that we may be well serv by some continu patienc

growth in the eleventh district   s economi seem to have stall sinc the august fomc meet   a sens of drift come through from our beig book contact  our recent board and advisori council meet  and mani of the latest avail statist   in term of employ  texa show sign of recoveri in the first quarter but has been slip sinc then   this would suggest a doubl dip recess   but if we use broader measur of econom activ  texa has yet to emerg from the recess   either way  the district economi seem to be lag the nation so far this year  in part becaus we have a larger concentr of industri that declin dure the recess   these includ transport  which is still suffer from the effect of septemb     high tech  which in our region is still suffer from the telecom bust  energi  which is still feel the effect of last year   s drop in oil and gas price  and mexico  which is onli begin to overcom the impact of the u s  manufactur recess   mexico   s special burden is that it is link to the unit state at the point of our worst perform sector  the manufactur area   overal condit in the high tech industri remain bleak  and high tech employ continu to declin   as one of our director put it about ten day ago  the outlook is    softer rather than firmer      activ is not expect to improv in the next six month  and industri observ don   t expect a recoveri in the telecom sector to come until after        if there is an island of strength  it   s the wireless industri  go forward  downsid risk seem to predomin over ani upsid potenti   first  overcapac continu to discourag invest in new equip   relat new equip avail through bankruptci is be sold at fire sale price  undermin the sale of new equip   second  purchas manag remain cautious about invest  and budget for spend on new technolog are constrain   this phenomenon has given rise to longer replac cycl and purchas in smaller increment   final  ventur capit fund to texa firm is down    percent from year ago level  although that may be one of jerri   s mislead statist   if there is ani light at the end of the high tech tunnel  it   s come from small and medium size firm that can now afford to absorb some of the worker laid off by larger compani   peopl they could not compet for dure the boom in stock option and salari   this confirm what our director and member of our small busi advisori council have been say about declin compens in high tech industri  anoth area of concern in our district is commerci real estat   offic vacanc rate are run around    percent in austin  up from onli   percent in the first quarter of last year  in dalla  vacanc rate are run at    percent  up from    percent earli last year   the vacanc rate is    percent in houston but is expect to rise to the mid   s within a year   rent concess on commerci properti have persist for month  and our beig book contact don   t expect a turnaround ani  e soon   residenti market had been hold up pretti well until a coupl of week ago   even the lower end of the hous market has begun to show a softer tone despit low mortgag rate  the resumpt of growth in the mexican economi and preliminari sign of strengthen in the maquiladora industri are provid some encourag to the texa mexico border region   the latest export statist show a sizabl rebound in texa export to mexico  canada  europ  and asia   howev  the    percent declin in the mexican peso sinc the begin of august   not bode well for the futur   the general consensus seem to be that the nation came out of recess at the end of        it is difficult to come to the same conclus for the eleventh district   look ahead  our own intern forecast is for texa employ to declin slight over the remaind of this year  on the nation economi  i find develop to be a bit  but onli a bit  more encourag than in the dalla district   signal of strength in auto and hous are routin offset by stumbl and sluggish elsewher   and the deterior condit of the economi of most other countri give me paus   last month   s tepid employ growth  half of which is account for by hire by the transport secur administr  underscor the continu weak in the labor market  as i read through the  book i kept want to believ the staff forecast   i agre that expansionari monetari and fiscal polici togeth with reason strong product gain could offset the headwind come from the stock market  excess capac  and the lack of busi confid  all of which are lead to a deferr of hire and invest   but i get sweati palm when i think about the downsid risk   what if busi invest  sn   t continu to strengthen as expect   what happen to product growth if invest spend continu to declin and we get  for lack of a better term     capit shallow    instead of    capit deepen      what if foreign growth continu to slow over the remaind of this year and next year instead of improv as project in the forecast   what if deflat in durabl good and disinfl in the rest of the economi continu to gather momentum   will we have to deal with deflat and a zero bound at the same  e   and with overal inflat trend down sinc we last lower rate this past decemb  how much has the real feder fund rate move up recent   are we as accommod as we think we are  gdp deflat has move from the low   percent area in the last two year to the low  s this year and over the forecast period   seven or eight year ago we use to joke that we were onli one recess away from price stabil   i think we   re just about there   in the beig book report we continu to find few sign of overal price or wage pressur   normal i am not  comfort by rise commod and gold price  but the strength in these indic give me some comfort now becaus they appear inconsist with a deflat stori  perhap the mild of the recoveri togeth with it movement in fit and start is due to the mild of the recess   and mayb consum and busi confid have been driven down by event risk that are now behind us and both will recov soon   as i weigh the downsid risk against the upsid potenti  i   m move toward support of a move to lower interest rate   the risk of set off a new wave of inflationari pressur seem minim right now   the main question to me is whether at current level lower short term interest rate would do ani good
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to concentr on anecdot inform that has some forward look element to it   i hear the same sort of report of a mix situat and feel of uneasi that everybodi els has mention   just briefli  let me note with regard to the hous industri that we had a luncheon with real estat develop and builder and i did not detect  in that group anyway  ani tone of excess op  or bubbl if you will  i thought there was a substanti air of caution and an understand that busi was good but it wouldn   t necessarili alway remain that way   so for what it   s worth  that   s my assess of the mood in that industri   mayb it just reflect midwest conservat  i don   t know  as you may have seen in recent press report  wal mart and other retail have a somewhat downbeat forecast   wal mart had sale growth of   percent  and my contact at the compani point out that that was against year ago figur that were depress by the event of septemb      he also note that about   percent of wal mart   s growth is es  to be come from k mart becaus of the latter   s continu difficulti as it oper in bankruptci  wal mart had been experienc   to   percent growth  and they just don   t have a clue as to what is caus this downshift   they track sale veri  veri close   one thing i find interest is that they do know there   s a paycheck cycl   peopl tend to go shop when the paycheck come in  so sale general rise at midmonth and at the end of the month   my wal mart contact said that they interpret the recent more pronounc paycheck cycl as suggest more liquid constraint on the part of consum   peopl can   t afford to shop until the paycheck come in  inventori level at wal mart and other retail continu to be in excel shape   look ahead  wal mart has not chang it order for the holiday season  but wal mart manag believ from talk with supplier that sever other larg retail have cut back their order for the holiday period  my contact at up report a downward revis in their forecast for the air packag express busi   their expect for next year is that volum will be basic at year      level  so they   re not expect much growth there   they are anticip have to lay off     to     pilot along with other aircraft crew  and they are reduc new aircraft order for the next three year from ten to eight per year   my contact said that they would have reduc those order by more but it was too expens to get out of the option contract they had enter into  they are in the process of park twenti aircraft soon by send them off to the desert   these are old aircraft   ten    s  eight dc s  and two    s   he expect that those plane would never fli again  up is take them out of servic becaus they just don   t need the capac ani more  he also note that custom want more discount  so the price environ is pretti rigor  and up is expect downward trend next year in term of the price situat   my contact at fedex was a bit more op ist   i think fedex has develop some busi through the unit state postal servic  which is work veri much in their favor  and they are expect a good fall season   for the peak fall season they anticip that volum will be up   to   percent relat to last year   that would be the first genuin growth in two to three year accord to my contact   a repres of j b  hunt truck compani told me  that his firm has yet to see the usual fall pickup in busi and that their custom are nervous   volum is a bit stronger or a bit weaker  and there certain is no upward thrust in it   so i   d say that the overal view from these scatter report is that peopl see the economi as essenti flat to slight up current and they don   t anticip ani chang in that situat in the forese futur   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the tenth district has remain pretti much in a hold pattern sinc our last meet   it has maintain earlier gain but has shown no further improv sinc earli in the summer   manufactur activ was flat for the second month in a row in august  after improv most of the year until then   in our bank   s august manufactur survey  product and new order both remain slight below year ago level  and firm are still cautious op ist about the outlook for six month from now   but that op  is not translat into ani increas hire or new capit spend   firm are hold back  our district   s labor market remain general slack  with firm have littl difficulti find well qualifi worker   fortun  the announc of job cut have slow in august and so far in septemb   consum spend remain general solid  though not quit as strong as earlier in the summer   retail sale were unchang or down onli slight in most of our area   tourism in colorado has fallen off but remain fair good in the rest of our region where it is import for incom   residenti construct remain strong throughout the district   home sale have also been solid  although inventori of unsold home in the denver area have risen and that has been a subject of some press articl recent   energi activ in the district has edg down late but still is fair good   and price pressur  as you   ve heard is the case elsewher  remain quit mute in our region  our farm economi is now in recess  due i think import to the widespread drought that we   re experienc and that i talk about briefli last  e   crop price have ralli as crop have wither  but farm incom will drop sharpli this year   higher crop price have not offset reduc volum from crop loss in mani area of our region   in livestock  which is our primari agricultur incom sourc  the produc are book rather sizabl loss   now  the higher crop price may mean reduct in govern payment  but as you probabl all are awar  there is now talk about a supplement aid packag for that industri  let me talk briefli about the nation economi   the econom news  as has been point out by other  is mix   consum and busi spend have been fair robust  while manufactur output and employ have been general weak   in addit to weigh the recent econom report in this uncertain environ  i understand that part of our job is to judg how the current oppos forc on the economi will eventu play out and to decid what we should do about it   current tend to push the economi forward  as other have mention  is the stanc of monetari and fiscal polici    low interest rate  especi for hous and auto  have led consum to continu buy   sever factor  though  are hold the economi back   busi spend remain sluggish due to the overhang of the surg in invest that occur in the late     s  as   point out   and for some sector  invest spend is go to remain sluggish for quit some  e  anoth factor that is keep growth sluggish   and it   s an import one from the comment i   ve heard here   involv  as presid santomero said  the headwind of uncertainti  we don   t know if or when an attack on iraq might come   we have no better idea about the likelihood  the magnitud  or the natur of a futur terrorist attack   we are feel perhap a littl better about the corpor scandal  but we don   t know where that stand   and in the face of this knightian uncertainti  the natur busi respons has been and is to hunker down  to wait and see what develop  and to hold off on ani major spend until we know more  busi individu after busi individu has told me that stori   that said  it   s interest that in both the  book and our own bank   s project we still are anticip gdp growth of   percent this quarter      percent next year  and   percent into        that is pretti much what we expect last  e   i can   t help but wonder what the outlook would be if this heavi hand of uncertainti were lift   of cours  i recogn that we   re unabl to predict these other potenti event  and we have to be prepar to act if they continu to hold us down as they are now
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m gradual chang my mind about the econom outlook   for most of the year that outlook has been moder to weak   monetari polici has been accommod  and we have felt that this accommod polici would be suffici to restor econom health   for most of the year the recoveri has been sputter  with some good data and some bad data   but we have persuad ourselv that we are  in the end  on track for a complet recoveri   perhap so  but the recoveri date has been push further and further into the futur   in the  book  for exampl  even though the near term spend data were a bit stronger than anticip  the staff actual lower the forecast slight   the high spend for auto and hous was not enough to make up for the linger and perhap chronic weak in nonresidenti structur and communic equip   the intern economi is weaken   again not dramat but steadili   in place such as europ and japan   on the anecdot side there is plenti of negat evid in the beig book and in other report we   ve receiv from the reserv bank  includ what almost everi presid has said today  one implic of this mix pictur is that the committe may have gotten lull to  sleep   we have been look for the smoke gun of a doubl dip recess   we haven   t seen it  and we have content ourselv with a moder perform economi for a longer and longer  e   evid in favor of this claim come from an examin of success  book forecast   in march the  book baselin case was for a      unemploy rate of     percent   it was rais to     percent in may      percent in june      percent in august  and now is over   percent in this month   s  book   the date of return to full employ has  gone from      in the march forecast until some  in      in the current  book   we have been toler a longer and longer period of less than full employ   of cours  the fact that the forecast output gap has chang suggest that we can   t forecast it perfect   inde we  can   t   but how should we interpret this fact   we know that output is at less than full employ level by most reason measur right now   do we see anyth on the horizon that restor full employ in ani reason period   the staff certain  sn   t  except in one of their simul scenario   almost everi speaker today didn   t seem to see anyth  and i don   t either  the evid is less dramat on the inflat side but still point in the same direct   the forecast in march for the core pce in      was     percent   that has been written down onli slight to     percent this month   but the futur forecast for the core pce show a steadi if small reduct in core inflat in the next few year  arguabl end up below some reason inflat target level   this lead to a situat in which unemploy is high now and   not seem to be get lower while inflat is low now and seem to be get lower still   believ  unlik jack guynn  that lower interest rate would s ul spend  it seem to me that if a      percent fund rate was appropri earlier in the year  as we all believ then  it is too high now   our basic dual mandat would seem to argu for a reduct in the fund rate   this reduct would have to be explain as forward look polici   not a respons to this quarter   s strong growth but to expect of futur soft and a respons that is not direct at the acut problem of a doubl dip recess but at the chronic problem of a prolong output gap   we could buttress the case by invok negat uncertainti and insur polici  but i would argu the case even if i felt that the baselin  book forecast were perfect accur  with onli garden varieti negat  one could rais sever object to this recommend   let me briefli consid three   one is that long rate are near a floor and won   t drop   sinc the last fomc meet  long rate have declin    to    basi point   both the nomin and real long rate are drop  inflat and inflationari expect are drop   whi is     percent a floor level to long rate   i just don   t buy this sticki argument  i think we could budg long rate down  and i think that would help the economi   and for those who worri about the zero bound  rememb that one import lesson of the literatur on the subject is that it   s import to get rate down earli and fast  a second object is that monetari expans rais those type of spend that are alreadi strong   we   d all prefer it if there were some way to s ul the laggard type of invest spend   but outsid of tax measur  and even they may have a limit impact  there  sn   t seem to be much we can do direct about that   short of work on invest direct  i think we have no choic but to work on the invest acceler indirect   last  let me say a word about militari risk   there   s incred uncertainti about those risk  we don   t know what kind of conflagr  if ani  there might be with iraq   nor do we know what ani such conflagr would do to oil price or whether it should forc us to rais or lower interest rate   one can come up with scenario on all side of this issu   but whatev the case  a militari event would be a discreet event  as was septemb      if we were to meet the next day to size up the risk and chang polici  nobodi would question that   therefor  i think we can leav that set of uncertainti for the futur and get on with make polici for today   s situat   to me that say we ought to cut rate   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in it public statement the committe has  been character polici as accommod sinc march  and real overnight interest rate have been around zero and well below equilibrium level sinc late last year   while the economi has inde proven quit resili  as presid jordan note  even after near a year there is no evid that output is head back to   much less abov   the level of the economi   s potenti  as might have been anticip with this polici stanc  both the committe and the staff have identifi a number of factor counteract the effect of s ul polici   mani of them relat direct or indirect to the unwind of the overbuild and overvalu of capit stock in the late     s   some of these restrain forc abat late last year  as overhang in inventori and capit good were work down in mani industri   and that contribut to the reviv in econom activ this year   but some of the forc actual intensifi over the summer  and that threaten to damp growth go forward   in particular  an unusu mid recoveri heighten of percept of risk this spring and summer great widen credit spread and decreas equiti price  in reaction to these same percept and to their financi market consequ  busi caution   our umbrella term for the residu and not quit understood shortfal in spend   also seem to intensifi   this was relat in part to the account scandal but not entir  in my view   equiti price began to drop sharpli and credit spread to widen befor the collaps of worldcom   and i think both investor and busi are have troubl  as are we  understand how this invest cycl will unfold  that my i has been deepen by the behavior of product   in contrast to the second half of the     s  busi have been abl to realiz huge increas in effici without much capit deepen   these product gain boost household and busi incom  but the drive to take advantag of new technolog has provid less of an impetus to busi spend than i had anticip earlier this year  the reason expect is that these forc will abat over  e  allow the effect of polici s ulus to show through   the key question is how fast that will occur   we   ve gotten some mix news on this over the intermeet period   the ambigu consequ of product increas persist inasmuch as we appear to be experienc anoth larg gain with slow growth in the capit stock  on the posit side of the ledger  credit market have stabil  allow bond issuanc to resum   we did get through august    without major new disrupt or tidbit of bad news  moreov  and import  privat final demand has turn out somewhat stronger than anticip   project of both consumpt and invest have been revis up for the third quarter   but whether these upward revis portend stronger growth ahead has been thrown into doubt by anecdot  earn warn  and further substanti declin in equiti price  which indic that privat sector gloom has not lift and may even have deepen   and labor market remain weak  evidenc busi caution about new hire and limit gain in household incom  there is no reason to expect that these restrain forc will go away veri fast and in the staff forecast they lift gradual   gradual enough that the growth of the economi   not exceed the growth of it potenti until late next year   in effect  the bad news is seen as alreadi in the market and reflect in busi decisionmak   as the economi continu to expand  equiti price should strengthen  risk premium narrow  busi becom more confid  and previous declin in household wealth weigh less on spend   but all this is project to happen relat slowli   even with the exist polici s ulus   so that output gap persist  this seem to me a reason forecast  given what we now know   but it   s import to recogn that we are in unchart territori in my view  especi when it come to busi invest  the result trajectori for the economi is not all that bad   output growth   pick up over  e  eventu exceed the growth rate of the economi   s potenti  and over the forecast period inflat declin slight from recent level   but that outlook is not entir satisfactori either  as governor   just point out   inflat is alreadi about as low as it ought to go in my view   societi is gain littl in exchang for the lost output implicit in an economi oper below it potenti   moreov  a declin in inflat   leav the economi more vulner in the event of further negat shock that the feder reserv could find difficult to counter  given the alreadi low nomin fund rate  this may not be a major risk in the staff forecast  where inflat  sn   t fall much   but if the declin in inflat is not minim   if the path of disinfl were steeper becaus demand was a littl weaker or potenti output a littl higher than in the staff forecast   it would be a more import concern  to be sure  our abil to move the    not all that bad    outcom toward the op  may be limit  given uncertainti about the economi and the effect of polici action   and even if improv were thought to be possibl  now may not be the  e to give it a tri   we can talk about that later  but i do think the greatest challeng to policymak in this and the next sever meet is not like to be the threat of a relaps into recess on the one hand or the intensif of inflat pressur from easi polici on the other   rather  like the vice chairman  i see the challeng as whether the risk and cost of an extend period in which the economi is grow but onli moder and where progress in erod the margin of underutil resourc seem unlik will justifi an adjust of polici
thank you  mr  chairman   the initi line of the  book indic that the tenor of econom report has been mix   obvious that is true   howev  like other around the tabl  i think the pictur that emerg is realli quit clear   i see it in three separ part  a triptych if you will  in the middl panel is the baselin forecast  which   pick up on what governor kohn and other have said   i would describ as not all that bad but also not all that good   as we   ve alreadi talk about  what we   ll have accord to the baselin forecast is growth that continu to be under potenti for most of the forecast period   the result would be a posit output gap that linger throughout the forecast period   resourc  particular in the labor market  are like go underutil for sever more quarter  and inflat  if anyth  gradual reced   even with an accommod polici i would describ this as a fair bleak baselin outlook that may call into question our resolv with respect to achiev the two goal that the congress has given us   one might argu with respect to the baselin that there   s realli noth monetari polici can do at this stage becaus of the long and variabl lag that we all understand exist   howev  to that core part of the pictur i add two other that may suggest a slight more heighten sens of awar on the part of the committe  first  i think some of the assumpt that support the baselin may turn out not to be as true as they appear to be on paper   if one look at the household sector  as the staff analysi indic  it perform depend on a number of under assumpt   some of them i think are true   i do believ that product increas and the tax cut alreadi pass by the congress will sustain consumpt growth   howev  some of the other assumpt i am less certain about   for exampl  the staff seem to be implicit assum that hous price will  continu to rise   i would argu  base on some recent inform with respect to whether it   s the level of mortgag rate or the chang in mortgag rate that drive both hous price and refinanc  that that   s realli not clear   inde  it seem unlik that hous price or refinanc will continu to go up at the rapid pace they have recent   i would note that some of that is still in the pipelin   but i   d say that dure the cours of this forecast we   re like to see it gradual erod  assum mortgag rate don   t continu to come down some  anoth thing that worri me a bit about the baselin forecast is the assumpt that there won   t be anoth extend round of negat wealth effect from equiti price   the staff assum that  dure this forecast period  equiti price will go up   howev  dure the intermeet period we   ve alreadi seen equiti price move down by somewher between   and   percent   and the impli volatil of stock index futur suggest a great deal of uncertainti about futur equiti price   if one add to this the fact that corpor warn have tend to move toward the disappoint side  i think that bring into question some of the basic expect with respect to wealth and how that will continu to influenc household and household spend plan  a final element that worri me a littl about the baselin is that i think we may be underes  the degre to which this nag underutil of resourc lead to the possibl of veri paltri increas in wage and salari  which again could have a bit of a negat impact   so i see obvious downsid risk to the household sector forecast in the baselin  i see someth similar with respect to busi fix invest  the forecast call for bfi to turn veri sharpli from negat     percent this year to posit     percent next year and to      percent in        the factor expect to support this turnaround includ some that are certain  such as tax incent and a depreci capit stock   but again  there seem to be a  great deal of uncertainti with regard to some of the other factor   for exampl  the forecast suggest that an increas cash flow and an increas need for capit to meet grow demand are two element that will s ul busi to invest  result in a turn in bfi from negat to posit   howev  i would say that neither of those develop is at all certain   we   ve alreadi seen in the most recent indic  for exampl  some suggest of an ongo slow in product  not an increas   similar  i think a soft job market is anoth indic of a soft product environ   i   ve alreadi indic that we   ve heard corpor warn about disappoint top line growth   so that leav basic onli ongo restructur and product increas  both of which are power but neither of which is certain enough to produc the kind of turnaround in busi fix invest that the staff is expect   so that   s the second part of the triptych  if you will  the third part of the triptych is the intern environ   we   ve alreadi talk about geopolit uncertainti  and there   s noth new i could say there   i must say  though  that as i repres the fomc and the system in intern meet i   m struck by what i think of as the passiv of policymak in europ and in japan with respect to their weaken situat   we   ve alreadi seen the bank of japan attempt to do someth fair strong and interest  but it turn out  at least at this stage  not to have had much effect   and it   s my observ   other have said this as well   that the situat in europ seem to be get no better and probabl is get wors   we   re often critic in these intern meet becaus we have imbal within our economi   my respons to that is that the problem is not imbal within the u s  economi but imbal between the u s  economi and the  economi of europ and japan that seem to present the major challeng  as you may or may not know  i am a real fan of modern art   but even i  have look at a lot of interest pictur  can recogn a truli ugli one when i see one    laughter   and i would describ this pictur as move from moder unattract to potenti much more unattract   the question is what to do about that   if i were not a more disciplin person  i   d discuss that in this round  but i will wait until the next one    laughter
i   m just go to summar my remark sinc mani of them echo the comment we   ve heard around the tabl today   i believ the econom data that we   ve been see recent continu to show veri mix sign about the strength of the recoveri   i would also echo the concern express by other about the direct in which our forecast are go  sinc the begin of the year  our staff forecast for the fourth quarter of this year and for      have continu been revis downward   in the past two month product worker hour and averag week hour have declin   we know that manufactur has been the weakest sector in this recess and recoveri  but we   re see industri product slow  not expand   and inflat in our forecast is also continu be revis downward to level that give me some concern  base on our discuss at the januari meet  on the posit side  howev  inventori liquid appear to be level off  and the forecast has sale increas come from new product by the fourth quarter   while busi fix invest appear to be near the end of it seven quarter declin  sustain growth is not forecast until the begin of next year   equip and softwar invest has alreadi begun to grow  and hope that should support continu improv in product   nevertheless  i share the concern mention that we may be experienc a capit shallow becaus of the length of  e we   ve gone without an increas in invest  the risk to the forecast to me appear to be increas on the downsid  though  econom growth forecast in the euro area have been revis downward  and problem in other region indic weaker support for u s  expans from abroad   and i  too  am struck when i go to intern meet that other countri seem to be wait for the unit state to pull them up  not the other way around  retail sale  especi for big ticket item and durabl such as automobil  still appear to depend heavili on discount   rise hous price have sustain the consum   s wealth posit against fall equiti market  and ani declin in hous price could have signific  impact on consum spend   howev  sinc i still have a hous in memphi for sale  i   m less inclin to believ that there   s a widespread bubbl    laughter
is that hous for sale
are you bid
no  i   m just point out that there   s a bubbl
overal  i believ that one other concern mention around the tabl is increas come to the forefront  and that is that the economi appear to be veri fragil   that bring into question the abil of the economi to absorb ani futur shock that may come from the various sourc that we   ve talk about today   we don   t have a robust recoveri   in summari  i believ the risk of a slower econom recoveri and inflat hover around   percent are move us veri close to the  e when we must consid further rate cut
much like governor bie  a lot of the comment that i have prepar have alreadi been state  so i will just mention a coupl of point   one is on the subject of fiscal polici   as the chairman testifi two week ago  the budget enforc act provis are about to expir next week   also  we will end the fiscal year without a budget for onli the second  e in our histori   and start as earli as perhap this week but no later than next week  the govern probabl will be fund on a seri of continu resolut from now until either februari or march   the signific of that  i think  is that from a fiscal polici perspect the govern will be lock in uncertainti for the next five or six month  i   d note a coupl of observ from the bank industri  mani of which have alreadi been discuss   the minim busi lend activ that is occur tend to be for  restructur or lend to achiev addit effici   one issu that i think is of some concern is that share credit or syndic credit are particular tough to arrang   the  except is leverag busi buyout with strong partner  although there is some indic   as presid   and some other mention   that we may be see a bit of strength among medium size busi   what i   m hear from banker  howev  is that they sens that we   re at the bottom of the cycl but they   re unwil to say so becaus they have said so now for some  e   so there is a reluct to suggest that this is the bottom   also  we   re hear word like    fatigu    and    stagnat    be use to refer to the econom situat  i was particular struck ye day by the report that we got   the chart that was mention earlier by dave   and the chairman   show corpor america in it most liquid condit in a decad   about thirti six year ago i start do cash flow analysi for debt servic  and i don   t rememb a  e when ampl corpor liquid was compat with the express    tough  e      when you combin that with the fact that the bank industri is in a strong capit posit  a strong liquid posit  and has good asset qualiti  i can   t figur out if that should be reassur or a point of concern   i think  on balanc  it   s more reassur   and come back to someth presid jordan said earlier  given where we were a year ago  if we had known then that there was so much dri powder in the system  i think we would have found that veri reassur  on the other hand  the term    fatigu    and    stagnat    suggest to me that there is a nervous impati in the air   combin with our fiscal circumst  that impati is certain a caus for concern   my feel  howev  is that if the market is impati  mayb this is the  e for us to be patient   on the other hand  as had to be done two or three week ago in this citi  there was enough anecdot evid out there that it was deem necessari to move to a slight heighten state of concern   i think the same is true for us   it seem to me that it may be  e to move from a code yellow to a code orang
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with mani speaker today that the recoveri remain disappoint soft   the reluct of firm to hire or invest is particular discourag given continu strong spend by consum and the remark growth of product   the consum and busi sector can   t diverg indefinit   that can be resolv in one of two way  and one of them is rather unpleas  a particular strike aspect of the  book forecast to me is that it envis continu declin in core inflat   as shown in the tabl on page    of part    the rate of increas in the core pce deflat is project to fall from     percent in      to     percent in        over the same period the core cpi inflat is project to fall from     percent to     percent and growth in the gdp deflat from     percent to     percent   some altern  book scenario have the core pce deflat fall to below   percent by        i think inflat as low as project is potenti a serious risk for the economi   to the extent that we believ the  book project for inflat as well as the unemploy rate  both of which suggest slack for the forese futur  this seem to me to be a prima faci case for eas polici at this point  i understand  of cours  that thing are never that simpl   there   s an enorm amount of uncertainti to be reckon with  and uncertainti suggest caution for central banker as well as for busi   one concern i do have about eas now is that it might exacerb the imbal in the economi by further heat up sector that are alreadi strong  such as residenti construct and auto  while onli indirect benefit invest and the labor market   i also appreci the danger of excess fine tune  overst  and overshoot  for these reason  i understand that we may want to wait to see how event unfold befor take further action   i hope  though  that we will not set the threshold for take action too high   the strategi of preemptiv strike should appli with at least as great a forc to incipi deflat as it   to incipi inflat   thank you
thank you veri much   that complet the roundtabl  we turn now to vinc reinhart
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to start with an observ about the market reaction to the announc after your august meet  use the materi that were just distribut   at that meet  some  member state a prefer to retain an assess of balanc risk as to your dual object on the concern that market particip would read a shift toward econom weak as signal an intent to eas immin   in the event  as shown in the upper left panel of your first exhibit  our es  of the path of the feder fund rate expect by investor shift up a tad in the near term immedi after the releas of the decis   appar  market particip interpret the decis as evid of a reluct to eas soon   but this appar reluct  the switch in the risk assess  and the associ word  against a backdrop of declin equiti price  seem to suggest a downward revis to the econom outlook consist with the feder fund rate be    basi point lower over the next two year than previous anticip   most market yield   such as the ten year treasuri yield in the middl left panel    trend lower in subsequ week   this movement is hard to squar with    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix      econom data releas  which were most mix   one way to quantifi this is to compar what happen with what would have happen had market react to the surpris compon of those releas as they had on averag over the prior ten year  i   ve mark the major data releas by vertic line in the panel  measur their element of surpris as the actual valu less the expect as survey by money market servic on the preced friday  and es  the averag respons with a regress use the experi over the prior ten year   as note in the middl right panel  the es  contribut of macroeconom data to the chang in the ten year treasuri yield over the past six week net to about zero   that is pretti much how the staff react to the data  in that the outlook present in the most recent  book   not differ materi from what you saw in august   one possibl explain the    basi point drop in the ten year treasuri yield is that other event intrud  includ warn on earn that further deflat equiti valu  elev concern about anoth war in the gulf that prompt a bit of a flight to safeti  and heighten mortgag relat hedg flow that dino mention   anoth possibl  though  is that your polici choic at the august meet  amplifi by subsequ public statement  sensit market particip to the potenti for slower growth in spend and product go forward than previous expect   while the near term econom outlook was about unchang over the intermeet period  you also receiv inform in the  book about the anticip perform of the economi over a longer period   in that first look at       the unemploy rate end that year about where it is right now      percentag point abov where the staff present put the natur rate of unemploy   in the interim  the unemploy rate is project to rise a bit from  it current level  a prospect that you might find like given the stubborn high level of initi claim for unemploy insur   as a result  the  book pose the possibl of the unemploy rate averag close to   percent over the next    year   the    policymak perfect foresight    simul report in the bluebook and repeat as your next exhibit offer potenti path for the fund rate that make more substanti inroad into resourc slack than in the  book   to be specif  these simul take the staff outlook and the frb us model as assur represent of how the world will evolv over the next five year and assum that policymak care equal about deviat of unemploy from it natur rate and core inflat from an assum target   even with a penalti place on chang the fund rate  the perfect foresight policymak embark quick on a path that send the real fund rate deepli negat by the end of this year   whether the inflat goal is   or     percent  much as in these simul  you might view eas polici   or    percentag point at this meet as take the opportun provid by the ongo favor inflat environ to ensur more solid growth of aggreg demand with an eye toward make more progress in fo  employ gain   polici eas at this  e could find addit favor for two key reason   in particular  the committe may harbor concern about the sustain of the econom expans   in the staff forecast  household spend is expect to flag some  soon as the allur of buy still more car and suv fade as incent becom less generous   real activ continu to expand despit this rough patch becaus firm are anticip to pick up their spend on capit good and to rebuild  their inventori stock   in an environ of heighten risk avers  busi may not be quit that will to step into the breach   moreov  econom growth has cool in mani of our key trade partner  and you may have doubt about whether policymak abroad will have the willing or abil to offset this weak if it should intensifi   polici eas might also be warrant if the committe found the  book too pessimist on an import aspect of econom perform   the staff has explain the good output per hour perform of the past few quarter as actual product drift further abov an unchang trend of structur product   if  as note in an altern simul in the  book  the staff has been too cautious on that score and the trend line has in fact rotat up  core pce inflat may be head south of   percent by year end       potenti below the rang mani of you would defin as price stabil   this might be particular worri if you take the declin in some  measur of longer term inflat expect over the intermeet period as evid that market have put more weight on that possibl as well   although simul such as the one on this exhibit might be taken to support a move of either   or    percentag point at this meet  there is obvious a lot more that has to enter your deliber than the mechan applic of a model   in particular  market particip will read what you do and say close for signal on your assess of econom prospect   in the current situat  it may well be the case that the s ul effect of lower interest rate would be offset some if that action were accompani by the retent of a statement that the risk remain tilt toward econom weak   if so  this might inclin the committe   if it thought eas were appropri   toward a larger move rather than a smaller one to allow it to assert more credibl that the risk were balanc   an unfortun aspect of this sort of interact between the decis on the fund rate and on the balanc of risk assess is that it may make modest polici adjust more difficult to accomplish at this stage in the polici cycl   one potenti way to ensur that the polici process remain flexibl is to consid the possibl of an intermeet move should incom inform indic that spend was lose momentum or geopolit event turn advers   but your outlook may be such that polici eas of ani magnitud would be judg to be inappropri at this  e   make the case for keep the fund rate at    percent at this meet can be accomplish by list what was wrong or omit in my discuss of the policymak perfect foresight simul   and some of you may believ that is a long list inde   but whatev it length  the list has two subhead   inadequaci of the process itself and problem with it maintain assumpt   as to the former  the process of calcul an op  path for the fund rate use the frb us model may lend itself to recommend excess fine tune of the economi for two fundament reason   for one  the model has the properti that u s  monetari polici has a small  but discern  near term effect on spend while inflat depend on a long cumul of output gap   this offer policymak the opportun to vari short term interest rate at a high frequenc to shape the near term dynam of spend without give up much on inflat in the longer term  you may assess the abil of polici to affect aggreg demand over the current and next coupl of quarter to be much smaller than the point es  in these number  for anoth  these model simul are done under complet certainti  suggest a degre of confid in the channel of polici that you are unlik to share   in the current circumst  the committe may be particular unsur as to how financi market will react to ani polici surpris   in the presenc of this kind of uncertainti about the polici multipli  the committe might want to shade it desir polici set toward that which will not surpris market   with investor count on polici stay on hold  this would counsel inact at this meet   but the committe may also favor keep polici on hold becaus it outlook differ from that condit the simul i   ve been discuss   as shown in your final exhibit  the real feder fund rate alreadi lie below zero  and the gap from  most es  of it equilibrium valu remain substanti   while survey measur of consum confid have move lower  household have been avid buyer of big ticket item  perhap suggest their spirit are undim   addit  the committe might be concern that ani addit polici impetus would flow through a relat narrow channel  feed the recent rapid rise in home price and further encourag household to stretch their balanc sheet   while this might support toplin gdp for a  e  it might also creat imbal that will pose problem down the road   this  of cours  is not a new tension in policymak   by definit  interest rate sensit sector bear the brunt of adjust in interest rate   with the outlook about unchang  hold the fund rate at    percent would seem to be consist with retain the balanc of risk assess tilt toward econom weak  especi consid what appear to be low odd of a pickup in inflat in the forese futur   while it is true that two date that caus concern ex ant   the august    recertif deadlin and the septemb    anniversari   prove unev ex post  enough in the world remain uncertain to justifi that judgment   inde  market remain skittish  the potenti for militari action in iraq seem signific  and the threat of terrorist attack at home was rais to    high    sinc you last met
question for     obvious  you have been convinc as usual   i think there   s an emerg consensus within this group as to how we ought to be look at the economi and polici   in this regard  i believ it   s import to summar a few develop and list various altern that we confront  first  i think it   s fair evid that unpreced level of equiti extract from home have exert a strong impetus on household spend   we see this in the incom aggreg data on such spend  though not in measur that reflect consum attitud and psycholog  we know  for exampl  that the level of exist home turnov is quit brisk and that the averag extract of equiti per sale of an exist home is well over           a substanti part of the equiti extract relat to home sale  which is run at an annual rate close to      billion  is expend on person consumpt and home modern  two compon  of cours  of the gdp  the long durat of the current elev level of home sale is a bit of a puzzl   at some point it has to drift down to a more normal rang  but it   s not do so thus far   similar   the histor high level of refinanc in the third quarter  as reflect in the data on applic report by the mortgag banker associ  is creat a veri larg increas in cash out  we es  that they  too  are run in the      billion rang at an annual rate  up veri signific from where they were a year or eighteen month ago   perhap more import  there is no evid of a slow in refinanc activ   the averag rate on new  thirti year fix rate mortgag is well below the averag rate on outstand mortgag   this differenti play an import role in model of refinanc activ construct here at the board   the model  which fit the histor data veri well  suggest that refinanc activ should continu quit strong in the month immedi ahead   accord  we are like to see fair high level of actual cash flow  the moni made avail from the cash out  until the end of the year and perhap beyond  the impact of this develop is not easi to isol from the rest of what is go on in the economi  but there is no question that a good part of the robust of household expenditur stem from this sourc   car and light truck  which have been quit strong  are exampl of the type of larg ticket item that are disproportion purchas when equiti is extract from the sale of a home   it seem like that increas in the averag size of cash out will persist  and one would expect these moni to have an impact on purchas of motor vehicl and other big ticket item   inde  i suspect that   s what we are see  it   s hard to know how long this process can go on  as governor   mention   in my view  it has been induc to a substanti extent not so much by the level of the thirti year mortgag rate but by the fact that the rate has been fall at a fair pronounc pace   our model on exist home sale actual suggest that the level of the mortgag rate is what determin the level of exist home sale  but this is a complex issu  and it remain to be seen whether in fact the net chang in the mortgag rate has an impact on sale   obvious  it must have an impact on refinanc becaus  if the rate on new mortgag stay under the averag rate on outstand mortgag for an extend period and fo  heavi refinanc activ   those two rate must converg   and as they converg  the propens to refin must invari fall  there is some evid of modest slippag in the sale of motor vehicl after the quit rivet increas in such sale in juli and  even more surpris  in august   through the first twenti day of septemb  motor vehicl sale slip back but they continu to be well abov normal in that we are still see sale in the area of      million unit  a total that would have been view as bizarr excess a coupl of year ago  we saw a fair pronounc drop in last week   s chain store sale  which is consist with the report we   ve heard around the tabl   howev  i must caution you that those chain store sale figur are not all that use as indic of overal merchandis sale  especi the week data that we look at   motor vehicl sale obvious are as close to an exact number as we  get in econom statist  and the es  we are talk about basic come direct from the motor vehicl manufactur   inde  it is essenti their tabul  car for car  that appear in the person consumpt expenditur compon of the gdp   so in apprais consum spend  there is a veri big differ between motor vehicl sale and chain store sale   one is realli accur  the other is close to dubious   even so  the fact that both are move in the same direct is suggest in my view of some slow in the growth of overal retail sale  anoth posit element in the outlook is the fact that inventori are get tight   our week industri product data suggest a veri modest increas for the month of septemb but probabl not enough to prevent some inventori liquid from continu   i say    continu    becaus i frank don   t believ the latest book valu figur that we have   the reason i say that is that the inventori pattern that we get from the industri product index togeth with our effort to track the movement of good indic that  after some buildup in the second quarter  inventori accumul turn decid negat in juli and august   that in turn is consist with the fact that industri product has flatten out quit signific even though industri consumpt still seem to be rise   what all this indic is that the gdp data and the industri product index are tell us differ stori   inde  when we endeavor to infer activ in the industri sector from the gdp data  we find that it is rise relat to our offici industri product number   to be sure  there is a question as to which is the more accur es    a fair signific part of the initi month es  of the industri product index is base on the hour data and the judgment that we make concern product   we can   t be certain about it accuraci but  as dave   point out  the anecdot inform   seem to be more consist with the slower pace of industri activ indic by our index than is infer from the good and structur compon in the gdp data  take out the markup and make the various judgment for import and export that one would get from the gdp system   i conclud that we are deal with a fair tight inventori situat  which is a plus in that we also have  as was mention befor  fair good liquid in the corpor sector  in a sens this economi is in a posit to move forward if a number of the negat that i will get to short are remov  anoth obvious posit is the behavior of the product data   i  at least  believ it   s an unequivoc posit  although the employ figur clear are not  it   s realli quit startl to see how signific the product number are   in the gdp account  we tend to look at the product data  and those data are show fair strong increas   nonfarm  product was up     percent at an annual rate in the second quarter   did you say you   re use   percent for the current quarter
actual  we reduc it to about     percent  allow for some revis in the hour data that we got late last week
so  for all practic purpos product is still veri strong as measur from the product data   it   s even stronger when calcul from the data that are base on gross domest incom   the statist discrep between the two es  is increas becaus the growth of the gdp measur from the incom side is moder stronger than what we are see on the product side   obvious  that relat strength spill over dollar for dollar into the altern product es    and  of cours  that   s the reason that nonfinanci corpor product base on incom side data is a good deal stronger than overal nonfarm product   for the last four quarter through the second quarter  the incom base product gain was     percent for nonfinanci corpor   that is a quit startl increas  and inde i would imagin that busi firm have expend a great deal of effort to increas product through various mean  includ the use of previous unexploit effici   at least  that was a fair solid argument that could be made earli this year  but it get pretti thin this far out into the recoveri   one would think that busi firm had scrape the bottom of the barrel six month ago   what we have is veri substanti multifactor product growth becaus clear we   re not get veri extens capit deepen  someth is happen  but it is not evid in the data   the hour figur we pick up independ from the household survey track the payrol hour fair close  and a substanti part of the strength that we see in the gdp data is in real product number   so  it   s not a data problem   it   s a data dilemma  but the answer is not that the data are faulti  interest enough  there has not been a signific acceler in profit  we   ve gotten some  but margin actual have been flat for the last three quarter   the reason is that we  are get some price deflat in the corpor sector   part of the acceler in product is show up in lower price rather than in higher profit margin   nonetheless  the data themselv look pretti solid and fair impress  and one wonder whi all the corpor manag are so gloomi if those data are accur   well  they are gloomi larg becaus they have no price power   they see veri weak nomin sale  with the price of mani of their product fall abrupt while the growth of their real output is quit signific   inde  that   s where a good part of the product gain are come from  it   s this basic attitud in the corpor sector that i think is the sourc of most of the major negat   as i will argu in a minut or two  i think they could veri readili have been overcom were it not for two fact   one is the corpor govern issu  the other is the veri obvious increas uncertainti aris from geopolit risk   you will recal that the economi seem to be do reason well through june   and even though it   s difficult to  prove and inde there   s some evid to suggest the contrari  my view is that the worldcom scandal is the issu that realli hit home   it told us that enron was not alon   and inde the worldcom situat come close to make enron look inconsequenti with respect to the scope of the malfeas that is gradual be reveal   one had to dig to find the misrepresent employ by enron   their procedur were veri sophist  with all sort of special purpos vehicl and other question account procedur   worldcom didn   t do it that way   they just put in big fat number  forgot everyth els  and got away with it   my shock at the account profess has not worn off  i think the impact of all that is now fade   and inde were it not for the rise in oil price and the geopolit risk that are emerg  i would say the chanc of the  book forecast be realiz are quit reason   all of this is eerili reminisc of octob        in  fact  i just look at a chart that reflect the emerg uncertainti of the gulf war   you will recal that the price of oil was go straight up after iraq   s invas of kuwait   it peak in octob  and the war was not activ engag until mani month later  what occur  as best i can judg  is that either the tax effect of the oil price rise or the repercuss on confid had a veri materi effect on the economi despit the fact that the nation bureau has label the peak of the expans as occur in juli        if we look at the individu data  noth realli move down signific until octob       and then everyth fell out of bed   between juli and octob everyth tend to drift   the first sign of a signific downward tilt in the economi was  as i recal  a fair mark pop in initi claim  we haven   t quit seen that thus far   yet  as of earlier today the price of west texa intermedi oil was over     a barrel   i haven   t seen the latest price quotat  so oil price have move up fair quick  and the effect seem to be spill over into the stock market and have a varieti of other predict repercuss  as a number of you have indic  the rest of the world is scarc help our economi  inde  the economi in europ   i should say the euro area   and japan are continu erod   the unit kingdom is do better   who said the japanes are the japanes
japan is japan   i said that
japan is japan  that is the equival   i subscrib to that veri incis thought without defin what it mean
well  it has to be true    laughter
oh  stop your erudit    laughter   the problem that we   re confront with is that we use to believ that the monetari respons to an oil price spike was indetermin   inde  a veri strong argument was made in earlier year when such price spike occur that the appropri respons of the monetari author was to tighten  not to  loosen  polici on the ground that the central bank should prevent the oil price increas from spill over and induc inflationari pressur in the non oil segment of the economi  the histor experi is now suffici conclus in my view to suggest that that   s not what happen and that oil price spike have a negat influenc so far as gdp is concern  that outcom   not show up in our econometr model larg becaus the coeffici that we get in our model reflect the impact on gdp of the averag chang in the price of oil   and if  within a limit rang of that type of coeffici  we put back into our model the price chang that actual occur in earlier period befor the start of a recess  the model will not forecast a recess   inde  that happen  e and  e again  and we are confront with the obvious question as to whi it happen  this suggest that the coeffici may in fact be signific higher under certain condit  or it may be that the coeffici are nonlinear and rise with the rise in the price of oil   as a result  the margin impact increas as the rise in the price of oil occur   the troubl  unfortun  is that we have too few observ to test that hypothesi in ani meaning way and what we know is larg anecdot   anecdot are in effect small sampl   they have small sampl variat  but the mean of a small sampl is better than not have ani inform at all  i think the way this lead us to look at current event is to recogn that somewher within the next month or two this uncertainti is go to resolv itself   one scenario is that we are go to get the impetus from develop that i would associ with potenti pent up demand   that is  consider liquid in the corpor sector  veri tight inventori  capit invest that has been held down to a mark degre  product that is still improv  cost that are still improv  and profit margin that presum are at least hold or mayb even rise   those factor are the tinder for a strengthen economi  if we take away the negat psycholog  and they are realli quit posit   inde  it could turn out that the upsid scenario present in the  book is too low  i believ  howev  that the evid is tilt more strong to the other side base on what histori tell us   we have to be veri care at this point becaus we   re go to get import statist in the next sever week   the august data on manufactur    new order are go to tell us a great deal   the general expect is that after the sharp rise in juli  order are go to come off   to   percent or someth like that   if that happen  that will tend to confirm that the capit good market are still in an uptrend and that the  book basic is on the right track   if on the other hand that number turn out to be veri signific lower  it will confirm that a real pullback is occur   and inde it would be reason appropri to attribut that weak to the grow geopolit risk that we   re see and the general fear that are emerg   after all  this economi has behav in an extraordinarili resili manner  take one hit after the other  and it didn   t slow signific in        inde  we might have benefit in retrospect if it had slow more   that would have given the economi a greater bounc come out of the recess   but becaus the declin was limit  we do not have a strong bounceback  and we   re now get confront with advers psycholog factor   one can say that some of the latter are endogen  but there is no mean of which i   m awar to factor endogen into our frb us model the uncertainti of a possibl war with iraq   and this is where a realli import question occur  i think we have to be care about how much of a margin we have befor deflat occur  although my answer to the question of what we do if we eas too much is to recogn there is noth written in stone that stipul we should oper onli in the overnight market  there are numer posit nomin interest rate as we move out on the matur spectrum  and there is a great deal that we could do in the way of monetari expans even if we are deal with de minimi overnight rate   so i don   t think that the downsid barrier is as rigid as we general believ unless we take as a given that the central bank can onli oper in overnight fund   if that   s the case  then potenti deflat is a more worrisom concern than i think we   ve allow for   howev  i don   t think that is the case  my own view at this point is condit by our not know what the august order data will show or what the next initi claim number will be   howev  we know that it is quit possibl  if histori is ani guid  that we may be near the end of a deep funk   if i may coin a word   and that we may come out of it fair quick and wonder later what was bother us   i doubt that will happen  but i don   t think it   s appropri to rule that out as a possibl   i have seen too mani instanc in which that sort of a turnaround has occur  much to our chagrin  as a consequ  i would prefer not to move today even though i know there is a good deal of sen ent around the tabl to do so   but i do think we have to convey in one way or anoth that  we may well move befor the next meet   i   m a littl concern about the next meet itself  larg becaus   what is it date
a wednesday   the previous day is elect day
well  it strike me that even though we don   t take account of polit consider in our decisionmak  there will be mani peopl who will wonder what we had in mind   so i think we should tri to convey someth addit in the statement that we will releas after today   s meet  not just the usual    we   ll keep monitor busi condit      in ani event  i would like to stay where we are and obvious retain the negat balanc of risk statement while also indic in our statement someth along the line that the uncertainti are due in part to the emerg of heighten geopolit risk   what i think such a refer will do   and inde the possibl of war in my judgment is where the real uncertainti lie   will be to character our explan more as a form of insur instead of be seen as an indic that the feder reserv has turn veri sever negat about the outlook   and becaus we are in a period where there is extraordinari uncertainti about what is happen  we have a disproportion credibl   accord  i think we have to be care about convey an impress that we think the economi is weaken becaus that can be a self fulfil propheci   in sum  i would veri much like to find a way in which we can portray this polici decis as one intend as insur as distinct from our more usual type of polici move that are direct toward longer term econom object   i happen to believ that if we could somehow take the geopolit risk and move it asid  if all of a sudden saddam let in the inspector and they realli were abl to look everywher in iraq  the equilibrium price per barrel for west texa intermedi oil  as best i can judg  would probabl be around     or     a barrel   i believ the market price would move in that direct fair quick and that would have a veri posit econom impact  so i view the geopolit risk as a good part of the uncertainti that are confront us  and frank i think we ought to say that in our press statement  if inde the committe agre   so that   s where i am   to summar  my inclin is to do noth at this moment   stay with the balanc of risk toward weak  but to keep in mind the distinct possibl that we may want to move befor the next meet   vice chair
mr  chairman  i concur with your recommend  but i would like to explain whi   if we were to move today  i believ that would send a signal that we know someth about the economi that nobodi els know   the market  the american peopl  and those around the world simpli are not prepar for that  now  one of the reason they   re not prepar for it is that we on this committe have had too much to say recent   becaus of the geopolit consider go forward  i think it is  extrem import that   with the except of the chairman  who happen to be give some speech tomorrow in london   all of the member of the committe use common sens and remain quiet about monetari polici   i say that becaus it will be veri difficult for us to amplifi on the statement that we will releas after this meet   few of us   probabl none of us   can pretend to be great geopolit expert  so we shouldn   t be give speech about geopolit   if we say that we didn   t take an action but we still believ that the risk is on the downsid  i think we   ve said everyth that need to be said   say that the outlook is gloomier creat problem  and say that everyth is okay is contrari to what we   ve heard at this meet   so i sincer hope that we can maintain some disciplin  second  i do believ that the econom situat will like clarifi itself in the next four or five week  and therefor if we move at all   and i say if   it may well be in an intermeet move   thank you
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   let me outlin a few thought that i had as i walk into our meet this morn   i start with a question  will growth momentum develop soon   you mention that we might know in a few week or perhap in a few month   clear  we have heard a lot of negat report   it   s not that the economi is sink but just that the momentum isn   t realli there   if the answer to my question is    yes     that the momentum can be reason expect to develop  then we need to be patient   altern  at some point presum our patienc will becom exhaust   in fact  we might even look back and wish that we had been a bit more impati a littl sooner   so an option is to attempt to give the economi a kick in the rear end to get it move rather than just wait  now  we do seem to be face with a general malais  particular in the busi sector   i often tri to think about what   s go on by ask myself what real surpris i can imagin    what two standard deviat event or data are we confront with   that would chang the way we view the outlook   i think there are two  realli   you mention one   product   i would add what has been go on with long term interest rate  particular the real long term rate of interest   in fact  those two develop togeth produc a puzzl   if we look at most of the real data  relat to the forecast that we made last spring  they are one standard deviat or less   that is  the data are not come in all that much differ than one could reason expect   there are no big surpris in gdp  industri product  and so forth   but the product number is a surpris   and  of cours  that mirror  i   d say  a modest downward surpris in employ growth   with output come along more or less in line and with employ growth be minim  that give us a product surpris  by the same token there has been a rather substanti declin in the last six month in the ten year bond rate  for exampl  the ten year index bond rate is down about     basi point  that is  rate other than shorter term rate have come down a lot  too   so  we have a product surpris  which presum one firm after anoth is look at  and yet one way to read the declin in the expect real rate of return is that the long run growth prospect for the economi and product growth have been mark down   i don   t know how to reconcil a declin in the real rate of interest with a step up in product growth   i think that   s a puzzl  i do believ that we need to be open to a rate cut in the futur   as you were talk about the possibl of an intermeet move  it occur to me that if we get what i   ll call an iraq  relat event  some geopolit shock  the stock market probabl is go to react to that news befor we do   and one of the issu we   re go to have to face is whether our action would be view as bail out the stock market   i think we have to be veri care about that becaus i just don   t like be in the busi of respond to the stock market   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i endors both part of your recommend  includ the implicit part about deal with geopolit risk in the statement   let me take a minut to talk about two or three other issu  one issu that a few peopl rais was a concern about unbalanc growth   in that regard    pick up on a point that he and i discuss ye day  which is that  by definit  interest sensit sector move more than other sector in respons to chang in interest rate   one of the committe   s mistak back in the     s  i think  was be too concern about tank the hous market and  therefor  the fomc was slow to lean against inflat   be concern about s ul the hous market should not slow us down here becaus hous is an interest sensit sector   to put the philosoph question on the tabl   if the choic is between unbalanc growth that get the economi back to trend or a perfect balanc economi that   s grow infinit below trend for a long period of  e  i know what my loss function look like   so i would leav that one off our list of concern  i   d also like to cover two other point that you made   one is the date of our next meet  novemb     i would argu that  if the data are clear  they are clear  and we will do what we should do
yes  we   ll do it anyway
clear  you didn   t disagre with that   the other point is that it will be interest to see if in fact for the first  e  at least in my short period on the committe    though i know you   ve been look at the economi on a daili basi for fifti year    the next two data releas clarifi the situat    laughter   if they do  i will be quit shock   i suspect that the next  e we get togeth we   ll have a littl on one side and a littl on the other
i hope you   re right
those are my comment  but i do support your recommend
thank you   governor
i can be veri patient with those who have more patienc than i have   laughter  but i   m afraid i   ve seen enough evid of weak alreadi
is that the end of the sentenc   presid hoenig
i support both part of your recommend  mr  chairman   as i said earlier  it would be nice to see how this economi would be perform if we could lift this heavi hand uncertainti  but at the moment that is not an option   i think that   put us in the posit of have to watch the situat care   and if the economi  sn   t improv or if we have a disrupt event  then we have to be prepar to move  whether in the intermeet period or at the next meet
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support both aspect of your recommend   with inflat about as low as i believ it should go and with the possibl of persist output gap and further declin in inflat  i would argu that the princip threat to good econom perform is subpar growth   and i certain think our statement ought to continu to make that point  i   m not yet readi to lower rate to address my concern without more evid   i do give some weight to the stronger data on privat spend that we   ve gotten over the intermeet period   especi in light of the difficulti of forecast and the uncertainti  i   m will to wait for ad inform though  like governor    i wonder whether it realli will clarifi everyth or rais new uncertainti  if the incom data over the intermeet period confirm the weaker pictur portray in the anecdot that we   ve heard around the tabl  then i think the committe   need to give serious consider to eas the stanc of polici further   as to whether that should be at a meet or between meet  i think the committe has been well serv by tri to keep action at meet   i don   t think novemb   is a problem   it   s the day after the elect   it would be a problem if it look as if we had put off take an action until after the elect   so i think it would be appropri to move intermeet  if the data suggest that that   s the right thing to do  or at the meet if we can wait
thank you  mr  chairman   i concur with your recommend becaus i think that the near term is domin by uncertainti of a global natur   for the longer term  though  all deflat or disinflationari impuls are not equal   and deflationari pressur in the good sector come from extraordinari product gain in that sector   not call for a polici respons
i support your recommend   in my view the key issu are the  uncertainti and the inabl to get traction in the recoveri   i think we will get some clarif on where the economi is  go forward   so i think the best thing to do is to wait and see
thank you  mr  chairman   i support both part of your recommend   i just want to make two comment   one relat to the point you mention about the credibl of the feder reserv and the feder open market committe  which i think is extrem import   i support fulli your suggest that we describ ani eas move as a form of insur  becaus the situat could chang quick   if we lower rate  we may find that we will have to move in the other direct veri quick as well   we have to be prepar to do that   so describ it as insur or put it in that context i think help the credibl of this committe   the second point is on whether we should move befor the next meet if appropri or at the meet becaus of the elect   i think we must let the data decid   if it   s appropri to move  we should move
i don   t wish to impli anyth other than that   i was be faceti when i was talk about that
i didn   t think you did impli anyth other than that  but i just
fortun  i think we have built up a degre of credibl such that the notion that we would move for polit reason hasn   t realli arisen    other than among an inevit number of comment   in a veri  veri long  e   and i believ that   s realli to the credit of this organ   i think our record has been realli quit impress in that respect
absolut   and we all want to keep it that way
you bet   presid broaddus
mr  chairman  i strong support your recommend   i want to make clear that what i was talk about earlier was conting plan   think about what we would do if we hit the zero bound   and that   s a differ issu   but with respect to the immedi situat  look at the whole probabl distribut around the forecast and not just one tail of it  i think stay with our current stanc is best for now  i would make one other comment   ned   made the point that when you   re in the vicin of the zero bound and you see weak  it   s import to move in order to avoid get there  and i certain agre with that   but what i   ve taken away from what i   ve heard in confer and read about this topic is that in such a situat  the central bank has to move veri aggress and decis to establish credibl for our abil to undercut the deflationari impuls   i don   t think a small move of  say    point would do that   that  in my view  would smack a bit of fine tune   so to me it   s not so much a matter of  e as of amount   as we go forward  if we see evid that the economi realli is begin to weaken  given our proxim to the zero bound we might want to consid a move of more than   point   i think that   s an issu that we ought to have on the tabl at that  e
mr  chairman  i don   t think our individu view of where we are or even what is around the corner in the next few quarter are all that differ this morn   in fact  i   m  probabl on the less op ist end of that rang of outcom   as my earlier comment suggest  i   m probabl still in the minor today in term of my think about our polici option   i understand and certain respect the view of other  but i have a differ view of the risk and reward of further eas at this point   base on my understand of where the economi is  i don   t think we   re deal with the need for an interest rate cut at this point   i don   t think it   s go to speed the adjust that we   re still hope to see made  we   d love to see some more invest spend  but not a singl businessperson i   ve talk to has suggest that a slight lower interest rate is go to spur invest spend   in fact  i   m struck by the telecommun industri  which i think is a po  child for the excess we   re tri to get work out   the ceo of the larg babi bell that run the phone compani in the southeast point out that they cannot possibl grow their way out of the mess they have in that industri   the onli thing that is go to bring ani kind of equilibrium to the industri is further contract in the number of firm that are involv   i think the ceo would worri that ani addit eas at this point might prolong the  e that it will take to get some of the margin player out of the busi   it might even lead to addit irrat price in the short term  which would onli exacerb the problem of get back to profit and stabil   so  use that as an exampl  i just don   t think that a rate cut is like to have the kind of effect we intend   i   m not even sure that  if we could induc addit car and hous purchas  it   s someth we realli want to do   and i   m not as convinc as other seem to be that creat an environ where peopl extract still more equiti from their hous is all good  in summari  i have to say that  while i certain understand and support the notion of retain the balanc of risk sentenc as it is in the draft statement   and i think the way you suggest is the best way to do it   i believ there is still a case for some patienc   i think we should trust in the resili of the economi and it fundament abil to work through this situat  assum that one of those terribl geopolit risk that you talk about  sn   t materi   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i concur   i can be patient as well   i must say  as i indic in my earlier remark  that i   ve had concern similar to those that presid  guynn just mention about the downsid risk of move interest rate ever lower   but i am concern as well about the persist econom gap we have  gap from what i would consid to be a more op  rate of econom growth  pace of employ growth  and inflationari chang   i don   t view the outcom we   re see in the  book baselin and the altern simul as op    and those  i think  are sort of the best case outcom we can hope for  so i am concern about that  i have to agre with governor   about this issu of data clarif   i   d be surpris if there were a smoke gun in ani of the data over the next two or three week that   s go to tell us unequivoc that we should either maintain our current stanc or move rate lower   and  frank  i have a deep prefer for move at a meet as oppos to outsid of a meet   but that   s someth we   ll just have to talk about when the  e  come   i think that   s all i have to say
i support both part of your recommend   in the brief period of  e   that i   ve been here  it seem that everi word that is chang in the press statement that accompani our polici announc generat ten addit question  but even have said that  i think it   s veri import to acknowledg the geopolit risk today   i think that   s particular critic
mr  chairman  i support both part of your recommend   i   m not yet readi to lower rate  and i hope that the data we receiv over the come period will clarifi the issu we have discuss  although i doubt that they will clarifi the situat great   my hope also is that a decis can wait until the next meet
mr  chairman  i support your recommend   but i guess i   m more  anxious than presid parri becaus i am get veri concern about the lack of momentum and robust in the recoveri despit the geopolit situat   i do think we need to pay close attent to what is happen as the data are releas in the next few week
mr  chairman  i thought you gave an eloqu case for eas today  and i realli thought that   s what you were recommend right up until the end of your remark  i agre with governor   that the  e has come to go ahead and eas   i also tend to agre with governor   in that i doubt that we   re go to learn anyth veri definit by wait a littl while   and i agre with presid broaddus that when we do eas we need to do so by at least    basi point
presid  n
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  and i would remain open mind about whether we will need to react in the intermeet period or not   but i would caution against respond to what are inher noisi data   we   ve had a lot of experi with that   and also against hold ourselv to a standard of previous  book forecast   i say that becaus  as bill pool mention  for the most part the result this year have come out pretti much as expect if one were to put ani realist confid interv around those forecast  they certain have been larg consist with what i expect for the year as whole when i submit my forecast in januari and juli
mr  chairman  i can support wait for more inform   i   m a littl uncertain and confus about the role of geopolit concern in the statement   we don   t want to tie ourselv to say that we would act onli if certain geopolit event occur   in particular  if the sluggish continu but the issu of iraq is unresolv  would that preclud action
i   m mere stipul my view that  if the corpor govern issu and the geopolit risk were somehow remov  sever thing would happen   the extraordinari pull back by the corpor communiti start with the corpor govern issu  whose effect has been veri evid and acknowledg by busi contact  but even that did not fulli undermin what was a relat continu recoveri   if busi firm chang their account practic  we get a differ view of the world   if on top of that we get consider uncertainti in the geopolit area  we are not go to find ani econom model that can conceiv captur such a develop   in my view  howev  it   s not someth we have to know in advanc   we   ll know it when we see it    i   m just say that we ought to be prepar to move befor the next meet in the event that we get signific negat number   i   m not suggest that the number due to come out in the next week or so are necessarili go to be definit  but i do know that  if this economi is tilt over into a declin  that will be obvious to us in the next three week and it will show up in a number of differ area   if it  sn   t happen that way  that will mean that the expans is continu  and inde i think the possibl of a lot of momentum when the malais is lift is be underes    i do not believ that we can effect make a judgment that econom activ is go to be x percent below potenti by the middl or the end of        i don   t believ ani of our model can even remot answer that question in a use way   to be sure  they will generat number becaus that   s what model are told to do   but my experi is that such forecast incorpor the weakest capabl that economist possess   onc the economi start to move  it absorb excess capac veri quick  and when it start down  the revers is also true   the veri unusu case is the presumpt of an economi that will do noth  which is essenti what the  book is say   so i don   t think we can look ahead to a simpl decis   it is go to be a tough one
mr  chairman  i appreci your analysi   i   m just wonder how you   re go to get all of that in the statement    laughter
i wrote it in disappear ink
may i make a comment
i think there   s a littl confus about what we mean when we   re talk about the import of geopolit event   it   s not as if we mean that a geopolit event is  say  that we start bomb iraq three or four week from now   mayb we will  and mayb we won   t   rather  the point is what the geopolit environ   to the level of uncertainti and the effect of that on the real economi   that   s a lot easier to convey in a coupl of word in the statement
if somebodi could tell me that we were go to invad iraq tomorrow  the uncertainti would disappear   look  our experi with the gulf war is that the maximum negat effect of the gulf war occur immedi subsequ to the invas of kuwait by iraq   it dissolv after the first two or three month  but it was pretti fierc in the  earli stage

okay   would you distribut the propos languag of the   yes  ye  ye  ye ye   n ye ye  n ye ye ye    press statement
all this silenc suggest agreement
peopl haven   t read it yet
they read fast
what we have tri to do in the statement  basic  is to captur the tone of this meet and to relat it to the previous statement   as you can see  it   s restructur from the august statement  but the onli thing that   s new in it is the refer to geopolit risk   is this okay with everybodi as it stand   let me remind those of you who  dissent that we have a new polici now regard the disclosur of dissent vote   we are go to state not onli who dissent but also what the reason were for ani dissent
not the reason but what the dissent would have prefer to do
the direct of the polici they would prefer
yes  of cours  that   s right   it   s the direct they would have prefer   but i think we all agre that discuss of those dissent by the dissent would be inappropri   the reason for ani dissent would be written subsequ in the minut of the meet  which will come out  as you know  immedi after the next meet  so it would be appreci if no one get involv in ani discuss of this becaus i assur you that you will be get a horrend number of telephon call   i would suggest to you that the best thing to do is not to answer them becaus if you get into ani discuss at all you will find that these caller are veri experienc journalist and they will get you to say thing you had not meant to say   i say that from bitter experi   i decid the onli safeti valv i had was to marri one    laughter
mr  chairman  may i just say one word about this phrase    owe in part to the emerg of heighten geopolit risk      is this commit us to take a polici  action base on someth that is happen outsid of the unit state
if someth is done in iraq
i just worri that that is how it   s go to be interpret   my own sens is that there are a lot broader reason  even beyond geopolit risk   and you cover some of them befor   for the consider uncertainti that exist   i think highlight it this way almost put a spin on it that say  in effect  if someth happen out there we definit will do someth and if noth happen out there we won   t   and i don   t think that was the sens of the committe
is it interpret that way
i certain don   t interpret it that way
no   as a matter of fact  i think it   s a subset of the broader statement in the first half of the sentenc   i don   t think of it that way at all
all right   i knew i   d be in the minor  but i   m worri about it
that   s all right   if in fact you are correct  then the statement is wrong   but it say    consider uncertainti persist       owe in part to the emerg            it   s the uncertainti that is the critic issu  not the geopolit risk
i know you can read the sentenc that way  but i guess i   d feel better if the    in part    claus had someth beyond geopolit risk or if that were just left out and the sentenc stop with the word    employ
i think condit have chang enough that not to acknowledg the geopolit event in one form or anoth strike me as misrepres the situat   let me just ask a more general question   when i accept three speech tomorrow in london  onli one of them had a question and answer period afterward and i had intend to answer onli question regard corpor govern and other nonmonetari polici issu  have heard the discuss here  it might not be a bad idea if i spent a littl  e on the oil price issu and it implic and a few other matter relat to the outlook without specifi one way or the other how we should act   i say that becaus  in the event we decid to move  it wouldn   t be half bad if some of those point have been made and then a move won   t come as a particular shock   what   s the recommend of committe member
my view is that it   s not just not half bad  it   s essenti that you do that   i think we need to prepar the market for the possibl  not the certainti  that we may make a move
i don   t think you should ever be restrict from talk about monetari polici after a meet for some artifici  e period that we   ve predetermin   i think your comment as you suggest would be good
anybodi els have anyth to add   bill
i would just comment that there is alway a risk that someth you say will lead peopl to read between the line and will rais more question than you   re abl to dispos of   that   s obvious a risk   i would also say that the two dissent will prepar the market for the possibl of futur action  probabl in a way that   s quit clear and   not rais ani other potenti problem
i agre with that
mr  chairman  i think you should be prepar and will to take question   i think it serv a use purpos of provid inform   obvious someon could take what you say the wrong way  but that   s go to happen regardless   i think you   ll do more good than harm
anybodi els have ani recommend
i agre with tom hoenig
i agre with him  too  more communic is better than less
my sens is that the less said in this press statement the fewer question we   ll have  but you can clarifi ani question in a dialogu type of environ in a way that we can   t do in a statement
okay  i   ll tri my best   i can   t guarante that what i say will alway come out the way i want it to   but i   ve been around long enough that i can put more word into fewer idea than anyon els i know    laughter
we all agre that you have a uniqu talent in that regard
thank a lot
but  mr  chairman  you   ll be speak in a foreign languag there
is there anyth els on the agenda that we need to  discuss  speaker       lunch
the next meet is wednesday  novemb    the day after elect day   if it were the day befor  we   d have a problem  end of meet
