good morn  everyon   mr  kos  will you start us off  pleas
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the handout that is in front of you   with the year end approach  i thought i   d look back at      a bit  one of the more surpris market develop has been the steadi   if low key    appreci of the u s  dollar   that strength is all the more surpris after the dollar   s depreci in      when it appear that the current account imbal had hit a threshold that was impact exchang market   but  as shown on the top of page   of your handout  the trade weight dollar has appreci by   percent sinc the start of        the dollar   s strength was broad base against all major currenc   as shown in the middl left panel  the dollar ralli from below     yen to     yen   that last    yen   from     to       came in a near straight line and was coincid with prime minist koizumi   s victori in the septemb elect and the ongo improv sen ent about the japanes economi   risk appetit among japanes investor seem to have risen and capit outflow have acceler  as investor look to pick up yield in fix incom market not onli in the unit state but also in market such as the u k   australia  and new zealand   as shown in the middl right panel  the dollar has also risen against the euro   at the start of      the euro was trade at about         today it is below        sen ent toward the euro has been poor  given lacklust growth and the widen interest rate differenti with the dollar   but i   ll comment more on that later   among the few currenc that the dollar depreci against were the mexican peso and the brazilian real   both countri have substanti higher nomin and real interest rate   and both central bank in recent month have been eas polici   at this point  you might be ask yourself  whatev happen to the issu of the current account deficit   weren   t the imbal suppos to lead to a weaker dollar  certain  that explan appear to work last year when the dollar was fall   the bottom panel of the first page graph the trade weight dollar   the red line   and the current account balanc for the unit state as a percent of gdp sinc        the blue bar   ideal  this should show that when the deficit is high  a weak dollar follow  while there have been a coupl of period when grow current account imbal were follow by a subsequ bout of dollar weak  for exampl  in the period after        there are exampl of just the opposit as well   the dollar strengthen in the earli     s and also the late     s in the face of high and rise current account deficit   when look at quantit  the correl between the current account and the next year   s exchang rate is weak     the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix            what  then  explain the dollar   s strength   the most compel explan    and this is tentat  i should say   appear to center around the economi   s strength relat to other major economi   that differ in perform is  in turn  reflect in interest rate differenti  as shown on page     this page graph the sovereign g   yield curv in    the u s  treasuri curv in blue  and the g   curv exclud the unit state in red   the composit yield curv are base on gdp weight for each countri   at the begin of       u s  short term rate were lower than those of other major countri and the u s  curv was steeper   by the begin of       and with the tighten cycl here alreadi well along  the entir u s  yield curv had shift abov the other  as shown in the middl panel   that interest rate differenti continu to  widen dure       with the prospect for further widen if futur market in the g   are to be believ    of cours  all that tell us noth about the futur cours of exchang rate   perhap growth and interest rate differenti will continu to drive exchang market  or perhap the current account will final hit some threshold where a sharp depreci is trigger   unfortun  review past relationship   not help answer that key question   turn to page   for a closer look at recent monetari polici expect in the  g    the top panel graph the   month cash rate for the dollar and euro   in the solid blue and red line  respect   and         and   month forward rate in the dash line   this graph depict the widen of differenti between dollar and euro interest rate dure the year   but it also show the recent uptrend in rate in the euro area  as the ecb final tighten by    basi point earlier this month   although that uptrend was contain by the ecb   s deliber attempt to signal that this was not the first of a string of move along the line of the u s  cycl    short term rate from forward rate agreement for japan  shown in the middl panel  suggest some back off from earlier expect about how quick the bank of japan  boj  would enter a new tighten cycl  with   month forward rate fall about    basi point over the intermeet period   although the boj has signal an intent to exit it quantit eas polici in the second quarter of       there has been substanti push back from politician   furthermor  the boj itself has said explicit that even after the exit from quantit target  short term rate would  stay at or close to zero for some  e afterward    despit actual or expect further tighten of monetari polici in mani countri  risk appetit remain robust   as shown at the bottom of page    stock market have ralli in most region   in fact  in local currenc term  the s p has been the laggard   howev  when convert into dollar  the return on foreign market are reduc  given the strength of the dollar  and after that adjust  the s p   s perform look a lot more like stock market perform elsewher in the industri world   emerg market equiti market have been boom in local    currenc term   and for specif market such as brazil and mexico   whose currenc have appreci    return express in dollar have been turbocharg    turn to page   and continu on the theme of healthi risk appetit  the top panel graph the high yield and embi   emerg market bond index plus  spread for the year to date   high yield spread have stabil at around     basi point    higher than level observ last spring but still low by histor standard   in contrast  sinc the last fomc meet  emerg market debt spread   the   line   have continu to tighten to all  e low   invest grade spread   in the middl left panel   show a similar pattern   exclud the troubl auto and airlin industri  corpor financi health remain strong   earn and cash level are both high  and leverag is relat low   that said  a bit of re leverag is in the pipelin  judg by the increas flow in lbo deal and announc stock buyback   the big credit stori in novemb  of cours  was the worsen outlook for gm   cds  credit default swap  spread for gm  shown in the middl right panel  are now trade about      basi point over libor  compar to just over     basi point for the high yield cdx index   near term prospect for gm have deterior signific  so much so that the credit yield curv for gm has invert   in other word  it is more expens to buy credit protect against a gm default in the next    month  than it is to buy credit protect against a gm default over the next   year   in addit  seller  of cds protect on gm have start to demand up front payment from buyer of protect   they are    front load    their coupon payment of the swap becaus of fear that gm will default befor they have receiv ani payment from protect buyer   the worri about gm were like reinforc by ye day   s announc from standard and poor   s that it had downgrad gm to singl b   recent declin in volatil in both equiti and debt market reinforc this low  risk concept and are consist with the strong risk appetit in market   while the vix has shown some period spike this year  the movement this year are veri small compar to histor chang   fix incom volatil is also low  as shown in the bottom right panel   turn to page    let me say a few word about the system open market  account  soma    the top panel graph the growth of soma in dollar term for each year sinc        so far  soma has expand by a bit more than     billion in         somewhat less than the growth in recent year   the main driver of soma   s growth is growth of currenc in circul   as shown in the middl panel  currenc growth    again  measur in dollar   has been trail off in recent year and is like to have it weakest year of growth sinc the late     s   we don   t know the caus of that fall growth rate  although greater use of credit card  debit card  and other form of electron payment may at least part explain this develop       look at shorter period  the bottom left panel graph for      the year on   year growth rate for currenc   currenc growth has deceler from a     percent growth rate at the begin of the year to about     percent   the noisi panel on the bottom right show the growth of currenc in the year end period for each of the past four year as well as this year through last week  with project for the remaind of this year in the burgundi dot   dure the      year end   the blue line at the top    currenc grew about   percent from novemb to the peak in late decemb befor the reflow began   the follow year the year end season bulg was less pronounc  and that pattern has continu in each year sinc   again  it   s not clear what is drive this process  but greater use of altern form of payment sound reason   in ani case  the smaller hump in season demand will  if it persist  make the manag o   reserv more straightforward in the futur   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper by the desk   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
with respect to your yield curv on page    implicit there are three observ from which you could presum get what you   re tri to get at  name  some form of weight interest rate differenti for the three observ   these do move the exchang rate   what happen if you take this back in  e   is there ani explanatori power in this relationship
i didn   t look at it that  close   i suspect that if one look at the relationship over a long enough period  probabl not a whole lot   that   s a suspicion
i thought we found approxim zero
this is a longstand paradox in intern econom   when you run uncov interest pariti and embodi the forward rate as the expect futur spot rate  you actual get the coeffici with the wrong sign in those regress if the  e seri is long enough   and you never get it to confirm interest rate differenti relat to exchang rate onli in the posit direct and with the magnitud that you expect   there are all sort of reason for that   my short one is that you   re run two endogen variabl on each other and  therefor  the regress  sn   t make ani sens  and so the result don   t make ani sens
well  this is a veri interest chart  and i like the color   but what   it tell us     laughter
well  there are  e when interest rate differenti seem to be the right stori  and this is one of them
i do suspect that the price of pork belli on occas     laughter
in defens of this chart  let   s just say that there are also theoret reason whi at  e there is this relationship
then there   s a question of whether the theori has ani fact behind it
we need to believ in someth    laughter
anyway  let me move on to my second question   you mention with regard to the perform of equiti market that on the bottom of page    if you took  the s p exchang rate adjust  it would look more like the rest   but you alreadi do that when  you   re show everyth in u s  dollar term
that was my point   i   m sorri  i was not clear   my point was that the s p look as if it underperform the other  but when you look at it in common term against the dollar  the  s p  sn   t quit look like the laggard that it   in local currenc term
okay   presid pool
you comment on currenc growth slow down as a consequ of domest issu  but is it still true that about half of our currenc is held abroad   probabl a lot of it  circul in place like russia that have been unstabl   so  one explan could be that there   s a    grow stabil in some of these area that have been heavi user of dollar and that some of this currenc may be flow back   that   s just a guess
yes  that   s a good point  and we   ve had that discuss here in the past   in fact  the es  are that two third of the currenc is oversea
two third   okay
we have good data on shipment   the shipment data say that the currenc is come back   what we don   t know is how much is go out by other mean  whether legal or illeg   through thing like remitt  for exampl   if one look at the other indic that is use  which is the number of      bill issu  and make some assumpt about how mani of those go oversea   then that reflow from oversea is tame   it   s damp a bit  so i think there   s some truth to what you say  but it   s hard to quantifi   and in ani case  the interest thing about this bottom right chart  at least  is that it   s probabl driven most by domest factor becaus there is evid of the domest holiday fluctuat
in term of the season
in term of the season  yes
i might add  presid pool  that we do make es  of the growth rate  of the domest compon as well as the growth rate of the foreign compon   accord to our  es   the deceler over the past sever year has occur in both compon   but we   es  that growth for the domest compon would be about flat or slight negat for this year  for the first  e in mani year   mayb ever   wherea the foreign compon  accord to our es   has slow from growth rate of around   percent earlier around the turn of the decad to a  littl less than   percent recent   of cours  these es  have to be taken with a big grain of salt for the reason dino indic
further question    if not  vice chair  would you kind make  the appropri motion
without object  the transact of the desk are approv  mr
thank you  mr  chairman   in the spirit of the season  i a  tempt to report that i bring you great tide of comfort and joy   howev  this is  after all  the feder reserv  so it is probabl more appropri to simpli note that tide have improv modest over the intermeet period   while not quit in the miracl categori  we have rais our project for the growth of real gdp over the next two year and lower our project of price inflat   as you know  we revis up our es  of the growth in real gdp in the third quarter by more than a percentag point and left fourth quarter growth unchang   as a consequ  real output is now project to expand at an annual rate of near   percent in the second half of this year   about    percentag point fa  than we were forecast in octob   the surpris strength in recent month has been widespread  but clear  one of the standout area of strength has been consum spend   to be sure  sale of light motor vehicl were a bit softer than we had expect  but that was more than offset by consider stronger consum outlay in other area   this morning= retail sale report for novemb provid further evid of the under strength in consumpt   although spend in the retail control categori  which exclud sale at auto dealer and build suppli store  drop     percent last month  that declin was more than account for by lower gasolin price   in real term  we es  that spend was up more than   percent for the month   that figur is somewhat stronger than we had expect and would like caus us to revis up the growth of consumpt near    percentag point at an annual rate in the fourth quarter   busi spend also has been strong of late   we are now project that growth in real spend on equip and softwar will averag     percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year  an upward revis of near   percentag point from the octob forecast   the surpris was concentr in capit spend outsid the transport and tech sector  where the incom data on order and shipment of capit good suggest that the earlier lull in spend has end   after be about flat in the first half  we are project real outlay in this categori to rise   percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year   as you know  we had been puzzl by that earlier weak and had been anticip a recoveri of spend in this categori   in the event  that recoveri has occur a bit earlier and with more forc than we had reckon six week ago      in light of the   percentag point upward revis that we made to real gdp growth in third quarter  it may appear a bit surpris that we onli carri the higher level  and not a higher growth rate  into the fourth quarter   but part of our upward surpris in the third quarter was in non auto inventori invest   with stock appear reason well align with sale in most sector  we didn=t see the need to make ani further upward adjust to this aspect of the forecast   moreov  some of the third quarter strength in gdp reflect defens spend that seem like to have been pull forward from the fourth quarter   both of these judgment appear to have been support  and then some  by incom data in the past two day   ye day= month treasuri statement and this morn   s read on retail inventori suggest that both defens spend and inventori invest are like to be even weaker in the fourth quarter than we had written down   balanc these softer read against the stronger retail sale data would leav our forecast for real gdp growth in the fourth quarter unchang at about     percent   in contempl the forecast for      and       we had to make some assess of the sourc of the strength in activ in the second half of this year   as we had anticip would be the case back in septemb  we are now in the posit of have to interpret whether the error in our forecast of aggreg activ reflect mises  on our part of either the hurrican effect or of the under behavior of the economi   we do believ that some of the surpris strength of activ is probabl  attribut to smaller negat effect from hurrican than we had previous pencil in   to be sure  product in the energi sector is come back a bit more slowli than we had expect  especi product from the off shore platform in the gulf of mexico   but outsid of energi  product appear to be recov more quick  output of chemic  paper  rubber and plastic  and some area of food process improv notic in octob and novemb   and we look to be get a bigger plus from the product of construct suppli   on the spend side  the hit to consumpt of hous servic  food  and gasolin   area that we had thought would be affect by hurrican relat disrupt   appear to have been smaller over the past few month than we had incorpor in our previous coupl of forecast   of cours  most of this remain educ guesswork and need to be taken with a grain of salt  but all in all  we are inclin to attribut a few tenth of the surpris strength in second half growth to smaller hurrican effect   we have interpret the remaind of the surpris as suggest that under aggreg demand has been stronger at prevail interest rate than we had previous project and that  all els equal  some of this strength will carri forward into next year   spend receiv a further boost in the project from the upward revis that we made to stock market and hous wealth  which total about    trillion over the forecast period   all in all  it= a stronger demand pictur than we were envis at the  e of the last meet      howev  the inform that we have receiv over the past six week has not been confin sole to aggreg demand   develop on the suppli side of the economi also appear to have been more favor than we had expect   the surg in output growth last quarter was accomplish with almost no increas in hour work  consequ  output per hour in the nonfarm busi sector rose at a     percent annual rate in the third quarter and is now es  to have been up more than   percent over the past four quarter   as op ist as we have been  the data have continu to outflank us on the upsid in recent quarter    in respons to this continu good news  we revis up our es  of structur labor product   in addit to an upward adjust to the level this year  we boost the growth of structur labor product about   percentag point to a bit abov   percent in both      and        capit deepen is make a slight larger contribut to this es   but most of the upward revis has occur in multifactor product   despit be near a decad into this favor product wave  there are few sign that the effort or abil of busi to implement greater technic and organiz effici are flag   on balanc  the revis that we made to aggreg demand were a touch larger than those we made to aggreg suppli  and we es  the output gap to be slight narrow  on averag  over the next two year than in the previous forecast   in respons to these develop  we rais our path for the fund rate anoth    basi point  to     percent by earli next year   despit these modest adjust  the basic contour of our forecast remain unchang   after increas    percent this year  the rise in real gdp slow to     percent in      and   percent in        that pattern reflect sever power crosscurr   we expect activ to be boost earli next year by rebuild effort in the gulf coast region   moreov  with energi price project to level out after increas sharpli over the past two year  the drag on aggreg demand from the earlier run up in price should begin to ebb   but these posit are more than offset by fade fiscal s ulus  the lag effect of tighter monetari polici  and a gradual diminish impetus to consum spend from equiti and hous wealth   in sort through the detail of our forecast  it should be pretti obvious that a flatten out of activ in the hous sector is one of the princip sourc of slower aggreg growth   after contribut about    percentag point to growth in real gdp per annum over the past four year  we are project residenti invest to be a rough neutral factor over the next two year   but that is still all forecast   to date  the hard data on hous have remain solid   hous start have remain at elev level  new home sale hit a record high in octob  and hous price as measur by the ofheo purchas index continu to increas at a doubl digit pace through the third quarter   that said  report of cool in the hous market seem to me to be more frequent and more widespread than was the case six month ago   as we note in ye day=    board brief  a varieti of indic of hous activ have turn down in recent month   household attitud toward home buy have drop sharpli  builder rate of new home sale have deterior  the index of mortgag applic for home purchas has fallen off  and the inventori of unsold home has move up   taken in isol  none of these measur has an especi reliabl statist relationship to hous activ   but taken togeth  they could be indic that we are at the front edg of some cool in these market   i offer one more piec of evid that i think almost sure suggest that the end is near in this sector   while channel surf the other night  to the annoy of my otherwis veri patient wife  i came across a new televis seri on the discoveri channel entitl    flip that hous       laughter   as far as i could tell  the gist of the show was that with some spackl  a few strateg place azalea  and access to a bank  you too could tap into the great real estat wealth machin   it was enough to put even the most ardent believ in market effici into existenti crisi    laughter   onli  e will tell if these indic are give us a head fake or are the start of our long await slowdown in this sector   for now  we are stick with our call that hous activ will level off next year   moreov  we continu to anticip that a more visibl deceler in hous price will be in evid by the middl of next year  and the associ slower growth of household net worth contribut to the project up tilt in the person save rate   in our view  both of these develop are critic for damp growth by enough to prevent the economi from overh   to date  the news on inflat   not suggest that we have overshot the mark on potenti  though our abil to make that assert with ani confid in real  e is admit veri tenuous   to begin  measur of core consum price came in a bit below our expect   we also had a fa  unwind of the earlier hurrican relat increas in retail energi price   survey measur of inflat expect have retrac virtual all of this autumn= run up  and tip  treasuri inflat protect secur   base measur of inflat compens have retreat as well   on the cost side  lower hour compens and fa  growth in structur product impli less pressur from labor cost  and the markup of price over unit labor cost has risen  further  point to a somewhat larger cushion between cost and price   these develop led us to reduc our project of core consum price inflat for      by   percentag point to about   percent and to trim our forecast for      a tenth to    percent   the contour remain much the same   we still are expect a slight pickup in core inflat as we enter next year  reflect the direct and indirect effect of higher energi price this year   in that regard  the core ppi for intermedi materi increas    percent in both septemb and octob  with the price increas concentr among good that are heavili depend on petroleum and natur gas  and higher price for these input as well as higher price for transport servic seem like to place some mild upward pressur on core inflat in the month immedi ahead   still  i think this forecast is best character as one in which inflat pressur are in the process of top out rather than continu to build      obvious  there are some veri import risk on both side of our forecast for  real activ and inflat  and we tri to highlight some of the more promin one in the  book   i recogn that our baselin forecast  in which the economy= growth slow to about trend  output settl out at a level veri close to potenti  and inflat pressur eas a bit  all with just a littl more tighten of polici  seem too good to be true   no doubt  event will conspir to forc adjust  both major and minor  on the staff project   perhap i=v just written the    flexibl and resili    speech for the chairman so often over the past few year that i=m suffer from someth akin to the stockholm syndrom   the tendenc of hostag over  e to sympath with the view of their keeper    laughter   but as i look back over the past year and observ how well the economi perform in the face of some pretti substanti shock  i don=t think our op ist outlook is unwarr     will continu our present
this is the  e of year when folk young and old look forward to receiv a pleasant surpris or two   and not necessarili someth that can fit insid a singl stock   we in the intern divis have found ourselv pleasant surpris by the strength of global econom activ dure the third quarter  which is now evid in the data  and the indic that some of that strength is continu  accord  we have revis up our es  of foreign real gdp growth for      to near     percent  about the pace we were project earli last year   the baselin forecast this  e call for econom activ abroad to continu expand at about that pace through the end of        the greater than expect buoyanc of the global economi was widespread and    not appear to be explain by one or two special develop that have limit implic for futur growth   among the industri countri  the strong perform such as canada had anoth good quarter  with canadian q  real gdp growth at     percent   but more sluggish region  for exampl the euro area  also did moder well  at     percent real growth   labor market have either continu to improv or remain solid   and german and canadian order data portend continu solid expans   among the asian emerg market economi  china  taiwan  hong kong  korea  the asean countri  and india all perform well in the third quarter  in latin america  a sharp rebound in mexican gdp growth rais the averag for the  region despit a veri weak quarter in brazil   some element of recent foreign activ do rais question about whether strength is transitori or will prove more persist   in the unit kingdom and some smaller economi such as new zealand  further increas in hous price appear to be contribut to sustain or acceler consumpt   howev  an end to the inflat of hous price could trigger a sharp slow of consumpt   euro area growth remain depend on export demand and lack support from domest consumpt  and the rebound in mexico was primarili in the agricultur sector and did not includ a signific bounceback in manufactur   these factor suggest a transitori element    in the recent data   in contrast  in the major region of the global economi  inventori do not appear excess and in need of reduct   privat fix invest has shown vital in japan  the euro area  the unit kingdom  canada  china  and mexico  these element suggest the expans will prove durabl    in most foreign economi  financi condit remain veri favor for growth  equiti price  in particular  have risen substanti over the year  provid support for both privat invest and consumpt   sinc the end of last year  equiti price have record doubl digit increas in the foreign g   countri  with the more than    percent gain in japan be particular noteworthi   among the emerg asian countri  stock price in korea have surg over the year   in latin america  mexican and brazilian stock price have risen veri sharpli   except for canada  the major foreign industri countri have all experienc expansionari depreci of their currenc on balanc over the year   for these countri  long term interest rate remain low  rang from about     percent in japan to    percent in the unit kingdom    we interpret the posit surpris in the pace of third quarter activ as indic somewhat greater fundament econom momentum abroad than we recogn in the previous  book   that momentum  in combin with the general support foreign financi condit  should sustain foreign real gdp growth  and we have accord rais our forecast for      slight   we expect that this continu moder real output growth will be accompani by littl chang  on averag  in inflat abroad as the flat path project for global crude oil price over the forecast interv should result in some shift down in headlin inflat   of cours  risk of an acceler in consum price abroad  owe to second round effect from previous oil price rise  remain   both the bank of canada and the ecb rais polici rate dure the intermeet period to counter ani upward drift in inflat pressur or in  inflat expect   we expect further polici tighten in canada in the next few quarter  more limit addit action by the ecb  and an end of the bank of japan= polici of quantit eas some  e in        by itself  somewhat stronger activ abroad should work to narrow our extern deficit in      and        but we have also slight rais the forecast path for the dollar in this forecast from that in the octob  book  and the level of u s  real gdp has been revis up as well   togeth  these last two factor outweigh the effect of stronger activ abroad and  as a result  we expect a greater u s  current account deficit dure the next two year  with the upward revis reach about     billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter of        about     billion of the increas deficit is expect to be account for by a wider trade deficit  with the remain     billion aris from a downward revis to net invest incom   our outlook incorpor a deterior of more than      billion in u s  net invest incom from the  second quarter of this year to the final quarter of       with negat net incom expect for the current quarter   with the current account deficit soon to reach      billion and project to cross the    trillion mark in      and with net invest incom signific negat  market attent to the burden of the u s  extern    deficit could increas   this featur of the decemb forecast is not such a pleasant surpris   given today= price for energi  perhap we would be better off with a lump of coal     and i would be happi to answer ani question
this is comedi central    laughter   i have the impress  and i don   t know whether the hard data actual confirm it  that the emerg countri  adjust for polici  polit  histori  whatev  seem to be do a good deal better than one ordinarili project   the embi spread has continu to come down through all sort of develop   we have the spectacl of the mexican a coupl of year ago or so be abl to sell   for the first  e a long term peso denomin debt instrument   brazil just sold one denomin in it domest currenc  and colombia did as well   the argentinean debacl never result in the realli aw consequ that were suppos to occur there  and industri product is up sharpli in argentina despit all of their other problem   venezuela should be shut it door by now  grant   what they   re do there  but it   s not do all that bad   is someth fundament happen that  explain all of this
well  two or three thing come to mind   no one of them alon would seem to explain it  but in conjunct they may be a partial answer to your question   one is that follow  the asian financi crisi  and no doubt in part in respons to what has been happen in the unit   state  particular sinc say        or        most of these countri have been run current account surplus and acquir intern reserv   the asian countri have been do it to the extrem  they   ve been pile up reserv and protect themselv from be depend upon the whim of foreign investor ever sinc that crisi   and they   re still do it  although i note an articl in today   s wall street journal quot some chines offici as say that mayb they now had enough   so i took that to be an interest sign     the latin american countri   for mani of the same reason  but without quit the same capac   have nonetheless put themselv in a posit of an extern plus instead of a minus   now  the latin american  in particular  and some of the asian have outstand debt  so they have payment schedul they have to meet   it   s not as if they are not in some sens still embroil in the consequ of their histori and so forth   but their posit vis  vis global capit flow has turn around enorm  and they have never gone back to polici that reflect an attitud of    the crisi is over  full steam ahead      they have retain this prefer for keep themselv net lender in a flow sens in the intern capit flow   there are mani reason to view that as a  problem as much as a good thing  but it explain  i think  whi argentina didn   t have much contagion effect and whi these countri seem to us to be do better
is there consider more exchang rate flexibl now
well  most of their exchang rate are float  yes
yes  that   s what i   m say
yes   so veri few are tri to peg to an overvalu exchang rate   even a countri like malaysia gave up on it peg exchang rate   so the float rate have certain improv the situat   but  you know  the peso and the real are strengthen vis  vis the dollar   so it   s not mercantilist   it   s not that these countri have somehow allow their exchang rate to becom and remain undervalu and that they are benefit from that   but again  i think the flow chang the risk charact of these countri and their abil to interact with intern investor   i think a second fundament is that asia  larg becaus of china but also becaus of india to some degre   becaus of the asian tiger  as we use to call them   has becom a second independ sourc of vibrant global econom activ   it was derail a bit in the late      s  but   actual onli a pretti short period elaps befor they were back on their feet   and their capac to     succeed econom is veri great   they are a high save  high product  strong work ethic part   of the world   and unless someth happen to forestal that  they   re go to be an econom region that   s grow  and  third  they   re becom more market base   the orthodoxi  so to speak   the increas  relianc on market  the addit flexibl  and the more stabl macro price   is pay dividend in these region as well   you still get a countri like venezuela that  but for it oil reserv  would be total in some tank somewher   and it polit are lead it in crazi direct  but it   s the except at this point  the other are more as i   ve just describ
well  that   s actual a fair encompass explan   it  impli that the lesson from       when they were tri to fund in dollar and lend in the domest currenc   tri to unwind the rule of account  which got them all into veri serious troubl    have been learn  essenti
there are still shortcom  no doubt   it   s still the case that asian market capit is not anglo saxon market capit   and china could still find that the enorm task it has set itself of chang that economi at a veri rapid pace could run into troubl   these are not  guarante  but i think it   s in some sens a descript of where we   ve been   and even all the shock that we   ve all talk about so much         enron  stock market collaps  et cetera   which were  everi bit as much global as they were u s  onli  have been absorb remark well  not onli here but abroad
could you give us a risk assess on your consum spend forecast   in      and       you have consum spend growth of     percent  while the hous market cool and save are accumul   would you just comment on how comfort you are    with that forecast   you made refer to it in the formal comment  but i wonder if you are quit comfort with the forecast or a littl uncertain about it
well  i   m certain uncertain about it    laughter   there   s no doubt about  that   but i actual see some risk on both side of that forecast   on the upsid  we are bank on a rather steep increas in the save rate over the next two year   if our larg scale quarter  econometr model want to extend the surpris low save rate that we   ve seen over the past coupl of year forward into the futur  that suggest the possibl of a greater step up in consum spend   so there is some upsid risk  on the downsid  some of the step up that we have in consumpt over the next two year is  relat to our forecast of an acceler in compens per hour  which  thus far  has remain veri low   and if we don   t get that step up in compens growth  we   re not go to have the labor incom immedi to support this pickup in consum spend go forward   and i think that constitut an import downsid risk  so i feel comfort that we have the risk reason well balanc  but there are some big question mark  i think  on the consumpt forecast go forward
i want to go back to the convers with     it seem to me that it would be help in the  book to have much more analysi of the capit account than we do   in the  book part    there   s a brief mention   you repeat it now   of the grow current account deficit   and i think we all understand that thing that can   t go on forev won   t   but on the other hand  we might be abl to have an idea as to some grow tension there if we understood more  about what   s go on with direct invest and  say  how much of the capit flow is simpli passiv financ by govern that are peg their exchang rate  like china and other     there is definit not much analyt materi on the intern capit account   so i would have a suggest for more inform there becaus the capit flow so domin the    shorter run effect   a particular question in that context is   how much of the strength of the dollar   this year might we attribut to the special tax break for this year   certain  corpor have been move capit back into the unit state   i don   t know quantit how import that is  i also have a suggest for     look ahead  the major share of gdp growth is go to be from the suppli side of the economi   we   re at close to full employ   and if you look at the   book  the analysi there is veri heavili weight toward an understand of demand factor    by my calcul there is  at least in one place  a half page on product in the labor market   but i think as we look ahead  we need a deeper understand of the determin of such thing as structur product growth and labor forc particip   so i would make a plea for beef up that section of the  book part
just as a quick answer  we have put assumpt into the  book about  the size of those capit flow  as a financ of our deficit   they don   t influenc the current account becaus the earn on u s  invest abroad are book as occur on a flow basi   when they  happen   whether they are repatri or not   so the repatri in light of this special tax break that will ul  expir would be a financ flow  not a chang to the current account   and probabl the number are big enough to be meaning but not huge  not domin  what we don   t know   probabl can   t know   is the extent to which the flow back to this countri are alreadi in dollar in some sens   are they earn in dollar or are they transfer into dollar over some long period of  e   if they are sort of sit there wait to come back in dollar  they wouldn   t have ani particular role in explain  say  the run up in the dollar over the last six month or so   without veri disaggreg data  we can   t realli tell that   and the turnov in the    exchang market is so huge that number on the order of magnitud that this tax break involv would never show up as a sudden outlier in a particular month  or someth of that sort   we   ve put  someth in there as an assumpt  and it   s probabl a piec of the stori   it   s provid a littl bit of extra eas in financ the current account deficit right now and is  therefor  a bit of support for the   dollar   but i wouldn   t think it is a domin factor
my plea  obvious  is not so much about that specif event  but about the analysi of the capit account in general  becaus i think it realli   make a differ how much of the capit flow is direct invest   and what   s go on there i think is veri import for understand
i certain don   t disput that it is use to know thing like the amount of privat versus offici financ  and the natur of some of the flow  and so forth   but let me caution you that  in the end  the actual data record for capit flow will conform to the current account balanc   there are certain market equilibria that impli certain ident   so the fact that the number are what they are isn   t so import   what matter are the term on which those flow occur  so thing like exchang rate  interest rate  and equiti price will tell you the characterist of the return to asset that had to be realiz in order to get the flow to be what the flow had to be
we will certain take on board your recommend to expand more of  our analysi of the aggreg suppli side   i would just say that this is an area where  in the past  sever year  we have made veri signific chang in the under structur of the way we   ve  produc the forecast   we present a great deal more detail in term of the composit of the  aggreg suppli side of our forecast than we were do five or six year ago   so i think we   ve taken step in that direct     i would also caution  just a bit  against page count for judg the amount of analysi of the suppli side   to get to output  we   ve got to go through all the various piec of the spend side to  get there   i hope in my remark this morn i made it clear that we were interpret much of the  news that we   ve receiv about spend to have suppli side implic and that the inform should not be taken just as a featur of aggreg demand   but we certain share your desir to have a better and more thorough understand of what is happen on the suppli side of the economi   becaus it has proven over the last decad to be a veri import sourc of macroeconom variat
veri quick  on the chairman   s question to     clear  there is virtu to massiv competit   my most delici ironi is the fact that similar date vietnames debt now  trade on a price basi richer  and on a yield basi lower  than that of ford motor compani    laughter   it wasn   t too long ago that we were kill each other   but we do have  increas  an independ central bank in mexico   we have better report techniqu in brazil    and i would  submit that while it may not be anglo saxon capit  part of this is just a matter of realiz the  valu of capit and the desir to attract capit   moreov  the improv at home condit make mani of these countri increas attract as an altern   and the competit is good  my question is to    and mayb   or other   i wonder if you could   not now but with some kind of brief or a paper at some point   give us a sens about the issu you mention of the lag in the effect of monetari polici tighten   i   m curious about the dynam in a tighten scenario such as the fomc has been pursu here   how do you calcul the impact and the like lag  e interv in the progress process that we   ve been go through as oppos to a one  e shock   i assum that your model includ a dynam   i   d like to understand it better  and      mayb some of my other colleagu would as well   so it   s not a question to be answer now  but if you   d be kind enough to do that  i   d be grate   thank you  mr  chairman
well  at the risk of go back into a discuss that i think presid santomero began and presid pool pick up on  i was struck by the slow pace of hire that is in  your project   you have job gain go from        a month in the second half of next year to         per month in        have come through the last three or four year  number like that in month employ data would be caus for concern  and yet we still have growth not that far below potenti   we have structur product grow  a narrow of the output gap  and unemploy stay about stabl   the differ be this rise in compens per hour creat enough incom to support the demand side of it   you probabl have talk enough about this but i found that slow in the pace of hire a littl disturb after what we   ve been through   and i wonder what your thought were about it   mayb i   m just ask the same question that toni was ask in term of the risk to consum spend
well  i   ll just add a coupl of further comment that relat to your concern   one is that  given our forecast of labor forc particip   which is pretti mild  as you know   we think you should be lower your sight as to what the under trend employ  growth would be on the establish survey   we   re now put that at rough        a month  so that
to keep pace with the growth in the labor forc
to keep pace with our slight downward trend in labor forc particip  so if we   re right about that   and as you know  there is consider uncertainti about that piec of the forecast   then you   re go to have to start think of        as a pretti good number   now      we   re actual abl to manag abov        over the cours of the next sever month and into next  year  in part becaus we do think labor forc particip is still below it trend   and as we move back toward trend  we can get growth in overal payrol employ at a littl abov trend   so we don   t realli see the eventu slow of employ gain as signal a signific weaken in the labor market   but we do have growth a bit below trend further out when gdp growth drop a littl  below potenti   so that   s also an element of the forecast  now  you   re right in some sens   if that were to occur in the context of gain in compens   per hour that are rough equal to what we   ve had  rather than the step up that we   re project  we   re go to have a shift in incom distribut toward capit incom and away from labor incom
and we think that shift would have a small negat effect for aggreg  demand   the negat effect is not as big as you might imagin becaus  obvious  to the extent that  the incom distribut is go toward capit  the stock market would be strong  so the wealth effect on consumpt would be a littl larger or capit spend would probabl be stronger   still  if we   re wrong about this piec of the forecast  i think it goe in the direct that thing could be a bit weaker in term of overal spend by      than we   re forecast
yes   i wonder about that as a downsid risk   the number jump out at me  even recogn your take on labor forc particip   thank you
i share presid pool   s long for more understand of the product forecast   my understand is that what you call    structur    is essenti a move averag   i   m interest for this forecast  sinc there is such a big markup in that  to know the extent to which the markup in the structur product outlook is mere an arithmet consequ of a move    averag that had some recent upsid data come into it   and the descript about how you   ve alter your forecast includ a refer to a technic factor that i think went over my head   can you help  us with that
i   d be happi to  if you   re realli will to listen to it    laughter
if it   s too much  we could do it offlin   and more broad  i   m interest in understand the framework you have for forecast this   it   s not clear how that work   if there is a memo or paper that you could refer me to that laid out all the machineri  i   d realli appreci it
we   d be happi to do that as well   in principl  the upward revis in our forecast for structur product growth this  e was due to two factor   one was that product was a lot stronger than we thought   but it wasn   t just that product was stronger  so it   s not just this move averag error term   it   s also the fact that we   re at a point in the busi cycl  with labor  market have tighten as much as they have  when we would have thought product growth would be run a littl below trend   so our previous es  of the trend of    percent  with actual product grow   percent  impli that product was be driven even further abov trend   and in our under model  in which there is a cyclic and a trend compon to product  that  didn   t realli seem sensibl to us at this point  given that we think labor market are close to balanc    we arriv at that view not just from look at the employ rate but at plenti of other indic  of labor market activ  which suggest to us that the under structur trend in product probabl has been fa  than we thought   so we narrow that tension by rais structur product rather than continu to forecast that actual product was go to slow back toward  our trend   i think that   s the princip sourc of that element in the forecast  now  as far as the technic factor go   i   ll be veri brief here   our analysi of structur product use nonfarm busi output and hour as measur from the establish survey     potenti gdp is a measur of output measur use gdp   not output in the nonfarm busi sector   and hour from the household survey   not the establish survey   so there are two  technic factor that tend to account for the wedg  the output growth in the nonfarm busi sector versus gdp  and the growth in household hour versus establish hour   and both of those  factor have been signific negat over the cours of the last sever year   that is  output  as measur by gdp  has been slower than nonfarm busi output   and growth in hour  as measur  by the household survey  has been consider stronger than in the establish survey   so you need both of those factor  in essenc  to reconcil structur product and potenti output   that is whi you might be puzzl as you look at the forecast wonder  gee  they   ve got   percent structur product but onli    percent growth in potenti gdp   but  in fact  that   s the way we do that element of the analysi   we   re more or less forc into that particular posit
okay   if i could just follow up for a second  in the late      s  your forecast of product growth seem to display a cyclic   almost a respons to recent product  growth   that in hindsight took it up abov where product growth came in and then down below  it   are you worri about the sensit of your forecast to recent data
well  the answer to that question is yes    laughter   but actual i   m not terribl worri that we   re do that in this kind of filter  which use the structur model and some statist filter   we are downweight the most recent observ becaus they haven   t been through annual revis   and there are plenti of reason for think that the inform   content in that third quarter gdp number is not as larg as the inform content of product measur in        so we tri to account for that as well
okay   i didn   t realiz that   thank
ani further question   if not  befor we do the roundtabl  let  me reiter someth that i think has been communic   name  that   is go to discuss in  some detail some of the back and forth that has been occur here in recent day on the languag of the statement   so pleas abstain from comment on the statement in the first round until   has made his comment   given that  have i discourag anybodi    laughter   presid
we   re a resili group  mr  chairman    laughter   we don   t get discourag easili   develop in the seventh district have been mix   the data releas sinc our last meet indic that manufactur expand at a moder pace  while hous slow and employ continu to be weaker than the nation economi   that said  our contact seem to be  more upbeat   we continu to hear report of labor market becom tighter  lead to potenti wage pressur   one of the nation temporari help firm in our district mention that they are increas unwil to guarante their client an hour wage rate for the entir year   anoth indic that entri level wage are go up   to   percent but that at the mid  to upper skill level  wage are rise   to   percent  so i want to discuss two notabl restructur stori that point to the flexibl of the u s   economi  albeit with govern presenc  notabl on the pension front   one is unit  which is at the end game  and the other involv gm and delphi  which is just begin   unit   s ceo is   op ist about their prospect  as they expect to exit from bankruptci in februari   their busi  has continu to improv  and forward book suggest that strength should persist in the come  month   unit is gain market share  while the industri overal is reduc capac   have unload their pension liabil on the pbgc and restructur their labor contract and other contract  they expect to be abl to compet with the low cost carrier  such as southwest      incident  the ceo of unit admit to me that ned   was right   he said that ned   s   posit on feder loan forc unit to do it the right way and to get the need concess from worker  supplier  and creditor  and assist from the pbgc   turn to the auto industri  as i mention last  e  delphi   s bankruptci could result in some meaning restructur of labor contract   but there is a signific risk of a strike that could  serious disrupt the auto industri  particular general motor   the negoti are at a delic point with three key player   delphi  the uaw  and gm   approxim    to    percent of gm   s part come from delphi  and gm has provid some guarante to the delphi worker for their pension and health care benefit   clear  the uaw is in a difficult posit   a strike could well caus delphi to close it u s  oper and reemerg as an intern firm with a far smaller  union workforc   a prolong strike at delphi could also hobbl gm   in a worst case scenario  this could forc gm into bankruptci  which would hurt the uaw worker at both gm and at delphi   as a result  all three parti have a strong incent to avoid a strike  there have been some posit sign   delphi has postpon the deadlin for an agreement from decemb   th to at least januari   th  and gm has given some concess to delphi on price   in my convers with   wagon  the ceo of gm  he felt that while a lot of antagonist public statement have been made  the most like outcom was that saniti would prevail and a strike would be avert   but to avoid a strike  all three parti must throw someth into the pot   and he could not rule out some wildcat strike at individu delphi plant   of cours  a settlement here   not solv gm   s longer term problem  which is loss of market share   and  as dino mention  s p downgrad gm   s corpor debt   not gmac  but their corpor debt    again ye day by two notch      in term of the near term outlook for auto sale  the consensus of    forecast at our recent annual econom outlook symposium was for a small declin in sale in      from this year   s expect pace of      million unit   gm and daimlerchrysl   s forecast were in line with this expect  but ford   s intern forecast is consider lower  at      million unit  turn to the nation outlook  econom activ continu to grow at a solid pace   like the  book  we see growth at or slight abov trend over the next two year  and this is also rough  in line with the consensus from our outlook symposium  the prospect for inflat present greater risk   there are two plausibl scenario go  forward   in the first one  the increas energi cost in      lead to a transitori increas in core  inflat in        but in       core inflat come back down   this is the  book baselin scenario  in the second scenario  the increas in core inflat is more persist  in part becaus there is less slack in the economi in        furthermor  monetari polici has been accommod for a long  e and there has been an accumul of liquid which ul  could show through to higher nomin spend   for these reason  both inflationari pressur and inflationari expect could remain elev for longer than envis in the first scenario  our statist forecast  base on the stock watson methodolog  are more in line with the  second  less op ist scenario   both scenario are plausibl  but the cost of the second one are higher   so from a risk manag perspect  we need to put adequ weight on the second scenario   this may requir more tighten next year than assum in the  book   but at this  point  we just don   t know   consequ  we should make sure that the statement   not give a  prematur signal that we   re near the end of the tighten cycl   but  as you request  mr  chairman  i   ll hold off further comment on the statement until the second round
thank you   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d describ the outlook for the u s  economi as solid  as the  book has describ it   obvious  sever factor contribut to this  includ the forward momentum that   s in the economi  the lag effect of past monetari accommod  which we   ve talk about in the past   veri support financi condit  and s ul fiscal polici   i would say that the evid from the tenth district is consist with this broader outlook as  well  but we also are see some slow in certain area   energi activ in our area continu to expand at a veri substanti pace   there is still a shortag of worker to support some of the expans that   s be sought   manufactur remain upbeat about futur activ and plan increas in capit spend over the next six month   in addit  consum spend  after drop follow the hurrican  has rebound solid in our region   howev  there is the point that   mention about hous activ  which   appear to be level off in our region   and while  manufactur activ continu to expand  it is at a somewhat slower pace   i would make note of the fact that we also are be affect by some of the gm issu  sinc gm is close it plant in  oklahoma citi and that will idl about       worker  turn to the inflat outlook  i expect core cpi inflat to be in the area of     percent next year  as higher energi price pass through to higher overal core inflat and as the effect of our past accommod polici show through   howev  i expect that the increas may be temporari  as  product growth remain strong and as energi price reced from where they have been  if that continu   nevertheless  i still would expect the inflat number to be in the   percent or slight higher rang       but that said  i think there continu to be a good case for further tighten at today   s meet   beyond that  i would say it is less certain  as michael said  and i think in our statement the matter should be couch in the near term   and i   ll stop there as well   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   first  let me share a few thought on what we   re  see in our southeast region   overal  growth in our district continu at an accept pace  with  most of the data and most of the anecdot report from director and other contact be posit across almost all sector  recoveri from the hurrican is proceed about as we expect  although it   s hard to track all relat econom activ  as mani resid are still live in   and mani busi still oper from   the new citi to which they fled   busi in the affect area that are open are now  report brisk sale of auto and cloth  as belong destroy by the storm are replac  econom activ for major rebuild and replac of hous relat durabl has not realli start in ani signific way   and if there is ani new realiz about the  e of that  it is that the rebuild process   and consequ the econom impact   will be consider more  protract than i first thought   it will probabl be a process of five year or more   almost half of electr and telephon custom in the area still have not had those servic restor  sinc we last met  there have also been more and more frequent report of a definit chill in  the residenti construct activ and specul in the frenzi coastal real estat market   while that is yet to show through in ani convinc way in region and nation statist  those report of a measur shift in attitud and activ are come from lender  develop  and real estat  salespeopl     perhap most relev to the near term polici consider  we   re still get numer report of price pressur and determin to tri to reliev those pressur by pass through the  ad cost   at our meet last week  two director from larg nation compani describ what they character as new window of opportun to get price increas   window they have alreadi jump through and gotten signific price increas that are stick   they report that even their tough custom  like the wal mart of the world  had accept those increas   it was also report that while regular gasolin price have come down  price of diesel fuel had declin relat less  and while some rollback of fuel surcharg may be occur  that is not yet evid  final  on a region level  earli holiday sale are report to be satisfactori   and our  director who is chief financi offic of up report that deliveri are run abov plan at this point   yet there is a realiz that track total holiday sale may be more difficult than ever  as consum shift their buy pattern from tradit  more easili measur store to a larger use of the internet for purchas   i also find the new inform sinc our last meet on the nation front encourag   the latest number on third quarter gdp were a bit better than i expect and describ what i  too  would character as a solid expans   we seem to have good balanc across sector   while it   s reason to expect some margin chang in the mix of activ as we move into next year  i expect more of the same in        while the signific fallback in oil price from their recent high  the continu strong competit pressur  and the robust product gain have all work to constrain inflationari pressur  it   s my judgment that we could still see a rise in inflat as busi continu to tri to recoup their higher input cost   and lean against those potenti pressur should be our prioriti  at least for now      against that backdrop  i would argu that by some measur our current polici set  at least go into this meet  is still accommod   and whether we choos to describ it as such in our  statement  i favor stay on our polici path at least a bit longer   i think i look forward to our later discuss of what the statement should say    laughter    thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  texa and the eleventh district are even more surpris  strong than the surpris strong rest of the unit state   we see growth in retail sale and manufactur employ  strength in hous start  and high occup rate   houston is     percent occupi in term of apart  as part of the result fallout from presid guynn   s district   in everi singl dimens  the eleventh district economi is solid  there is price seepag from natur gas and other product   the most alarm will be util bill  which are expect to jump by    percent next year   but what is taken from   often goe  into paul   s pocket or  as we say  what is taken from pedro goe into pablo   s pocket in texa   and  the best exampl i can give you is from the ceo of american airlin  who told me ye day that their fuel bill over the last two year has increas    billion   as he put it     the blood is be suck out of me  and it   s go to our friend down the street      in this instanc  that is liter the case  becaus exxon is a coupl of block away down the street   in term of our local economi  this is healthi for us becaus we   re energi neutral   in the activ surround energi  the rig count is up    percent this year   energi compani profit are soar  as i refer to earlier   oil royalti stream and  miner right hold are expect to rise dramat  so we have a wash as far as energi price are concern   the bottom line is that texa is a veri happi place  the eleventh district is a veri happi place  and our economi is strong   and it show you the dynam natur of our countri     nation  both the  book and anecdot evid indic that the economi is equal solid   we see it in the retail sale data  as   report today   but one of the aspect of those retail  sale number  accord to our interlocutor at the big box distributor  is that less than half the good  sold in what they call the    novemb frenzi    were deepli discount good   in other word  the sale were solid  i spoke to sixteen ceo and cfos in prepar for today   i basic heard onli one new  concern  mr  chairman  which goe back to the point that   was make earlier about  global   also  i want to point out that one of the big homebuild   hovnanian   confirm what you said      as he put it  investor   mean specul   are exit the busi and it  is return to normal   but the common concern come from the retail  the rail  the shipper  the shipbuild  and so on  was the follow   everyon i   ve talk to continu to tri to figur out way to exploit global   each of them  from the it  inform technolog  guy to the big box retail to the specialti chemic firm to the servic firm  want to have offshor suppli   one of the ceo said     we have a long way to go in exploit china      we   ve heard that forev   and one  of my favorit was the comment     china  india  and indonesia can make italian ceram better than italian can now or could     year ago       laughter  the problem that i   m begin to hear seep into the convers  mr  chairman  has to  do with u s  infrastructur   if you read the new york  e articl two day ago about shanghai   s  new deep water port  you have to realiz that those facil are be built to ship good out of  china  not so much to ship good into china   and consid this  as report by one of the shipper i  spoke with     percent of all the ship on order for construct are contain ship   capac  expand contain busi is increas at    percent or more per annum to carri cargo from shanghai and other part of the world to the unit state      now  this is good news on the disinflationari front   as the ceo of northern navig  one of the larger shipper told me     transport by ship will essenti be free when these number are realiz in the marketplac      the bad news is statesid   we don   t have the capac to absorb it  long beach and the northwest harbor are constrain   work rule  accord to our interlocutor  are veri slow to adjust   but there are way to beat the bottleneck  and i just want to mention two  up report that they have gone from   to      and now for next year      flight from china   wal mart just built a four million squar foot warehous in the houston port  in order to shift part of the burden from long beach   but it is evid that the enemi is us as far as exploit global  and i think that   s a long term problem that we might want to take note of over  e  present  i argu that the economi is solid   we have veri good growth   i   m still a littl  worri about inflat  but i   m convinc that we   re nip it in the bud by the action of the fomc  and that we might want to paus sooner rather than later   but  again  we might discuss that in the discuss of the statement   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   incom data sinc our last meet have been quit encourag   econom growth over the next few quarter should be boost by rebuild and the full return of energi product in the gulf   as rebuild wind down and the lag effect of  monetari polici tighten take hold  it seem plausibl that growth will slow toward potenti  keep unemploy around the current level of   percent  the scenario envis in the  book  the economi   s remark resili in the face of devast hurrican and three year of rise energi price suggest that the expans has gain foot and no longer need support from monetari polici accommod   instead  a key issu face us over the next few meet is    whether polici might actual need to move to a restrict stanc in order to forestal inflationari pressur  i will therefor focus my attent on the factor affect the inflat outlook   to do that  we need to look first at the here and now and remind ourselv that recent read on core price  have consist come in at or below expect   there are no sign of acceler   in fact  core pce  person consumpt expenditur  price inflat has slow over the past year  the most recent read of     percent over the past twelv month is down     from the preced year   and  the downward inflat trend has continu through this year  with core pce inflat run at onli     percent over the past six month  which is about the middl of my prefer rang   of cours  even though recent core inflat data look pretti darn good  there may be forc at work that could  undermin price stabil   in my remain remark  i   d like to comment on some factor that could push inflat higher and consid their like effect in the current situat  the first risk to price stabil is that  contrari to the  book forecast  growth may not actual subsid toward potenti   so labor and product market could tighten further  push unemploy below nairu  which current es  place around   percent   this possibl is illustr in the stronger aggreg demand scenario in the  book   that simul show that monetari polici would  of cours  need to tighten   but the inflat consequ would be modest   given a reactiv taylor rule monetari polici respons   so to deal with this risk  it seem to me that  polici need not be preemptiv  a sustain slowdown in product growth would pose a more challeng dilemma for  polici and the inflat outlook   fortun  howev  product growth over the past year has not  slow   quit the contrari  it has been surpris robust   output per hour in the nonfarm busi  sector grew more than   percent over the past year  beat out previous es  of structur    product growth of around    percent   as i discuss at our meet a year ago  i think there are compel reason whi product growth may well remain elev for some  e  have to do with the gradual diffus of new technolog and workplac practic throughout the economi   therefor  i concur with the staff   s conclus that the accumul evid indic that structur product growth is around   percent and with the correspond upward revis in the outlook for actual product   given the sluggish adjust of wage to chang in product  the stronger path of product reduc the rate of growth of unit labor cost  put downward pressur on inflat   so product trend suggest a temper of inflationari pressur  not an intensif  energi price also pose a potenti threat to inflat   but as i argu a few meet back   the empir evid   not support signific pass through of energi price into core inflat   i won   t repeat those argument today but simpli note  onc again  that core pce inflat has actual  moder  despit a near    percent increas in energi price over the past year  on top of a    percent rise in the previous year   moreov  energi price on the whole have come down sharpli of late  and  therefor  the risk of signific pass through to core inflat has moder as well  in addit  it appear that the fed   s credibl has held up well this year  despit the suppli shock associ with higher energi price and hurrican   survey measur of longer run inflat expect are about where they stood befor the storm   longer run inflat expect base on treasuri secur have come down about   percentag point sinc the last fomc meet and are now below level of a year ago  final  it   s possibl that wage growth could acceler  put upward pressur on the growth of unit labor cost and inflat   and  inde  the  book forecast project exact such an  acceler  reflect lag pass through of earlier increas in both energi price and product  into wage   in particular  the  book forecast that hour compens  as measur by the      employ cost index  will increas     percent in       follow a   percent gain this year   it project an even larger       percentag point   acceler in compens per hour in the nonfarm busi sector  to gaug the likelihood of such an acceler in compens  my staff examin the pass through of energi price and product into wage   they use forecast model in which wage inflat is determin by lag wage inflat  price inflat  product growth  and the unemploy rate   now  it turn out that when the sampl period use in the analysi includ the     s  our empir work find clear evid of pass through from energi price into compens  but when the sampl begin in the     s  pass through effect from energi price to compens are dramat weaker or insignific   this result is consist with the find i report previous   there is no real evid that energi price pass through to core consum inflat sinc  the earli     s   with respect to the pass through of product growth into compens  our staff find evid of onli veri gradual pass through regardless of the sampl period   go forward  our model predict signific less increas in compens growth than the  book over the            forecast horizon   we conclud from this empir work that an increas in inflat due to a  sharp acceler in compens growth is  at most  an upsid risk to inflat and not the most probabl outcom   i open my remark by note that a key issu face us over the next few meet is  whether polici need to move to a restrict stanc in order to forestal inflationari pressur   while  we must obvious remain vigil and respond to develop that threaten price stabil  the evid that we have at this  e  in my opinion  point to relat low and stabl inflat go forward   moreov  histori teach us that it is not easi to forese the point at which past polici     tighten take hold and the economi reach a turn point   therefor  it   s import that we keep  the lag of monetari polici action in mind in our deliber and not go too far
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i think a fair read of new  england   s economi is that it continu to be a bit weaker than the nation   s as a whole   to be sure  this sens is skew by condit in massachusett  which alon account for about half of the region   s employ   nonfarm employ declin again in octob after a somewhat bigger drop in septemb  soften the region   s year over year job growth rate to about half of the nation   s as a whole   but massachusett account for more than the recent net loss  with job gain in all of the other state act to offset drop in the bay state   other indic of state health show similar  pattern   in particular  the philadelphia fed   s coincid index show growth in massachusett flatten while growth in the other five state is acceler  a question one could ask  and one that i   ve been ask myself  is whether employ data  and indic deriv larg from measur of job growth correct provid the best sens of the   overal climat of a region economi   and in the case of massachusett  a state economi   that is driven increas by high valu ad industri whose employ pattern reflect cycl of innov more than tradit busi cycl   contact in the high tech  biotech  and softwar world all indic that busi is solid and that money to expand is freeli avail   depend on the product  growth is either occur or in the work  but often the relat hire is plan for  lower cost state outsid new england or other countri   these busi want their headquart to remain in new england   they want to strengthen their link to the research be done in the major univers  and they regard the high skill labor that they need in their research activ as    hard to find and increas expens   but when they expand more broad  they are choos to expand elsewher  thus  there are area of strength and weak in some of the region data   the state of the region seem to be do pretti well fiscal  and that reflect the profit of mani of these high tech type of busi   but busi that thrive on grow job count  like commerci offic market  seem quit slow   and person incom tax collect are lag a bit  at least relat to what the state have project in their budget   somewhat surpris  consum confid has tick up a bit despit the flat job pictur  and residenti real estat market still seem strong  though the high end has lost a bit of steam   travel and tourism has it tos and fros   the fall wasn   t  particular good for leaf peep  but the winter look not bad becaus there has been some earli snowfal for ski  the region is go to bear the brunt of high energi cost this winter  given it depend on heat oil and expens natur gas for electr generat   that probabl is the reason whi overal busi confid has soften a bit   in my expect  the region may well continu to lag the nation in job growth  but should prove resili through the winter month   i think the mix of it  industri is not onli provid resili to the region but also an ongo impetus to the product growth we see for the nation as a whole  incom data sinc the last committe meet were on the high side of our expect and provid welcom assur that at least for the  e be the energi shock  hurrican destruct  and slight soften in hous market did littl to imped the under forward momentum of the nation economi   and the recent robust data on product growth provid even more assur that this pace of under momentum is occur at a  e when there may be more rather than less  capac   inde  if one assum less of a downward trend in labor forc particip than the      book project  which is certain in the realm of the possibl  avail capac could be even greater  our forecast is perhap not quit as op ist as the  book   s  but it   see the same  two rather distinct econom phase over the forecast horizon   in the near term  after a bit of a dip in the fourth quarter  which may not be much of a dip at this point  growth acceler as hurrican rebuild proceed  feder spend increas  energi price growth rate flatten  and inventori are rebuilt   then by mid       the economi slow  as tighter monetari polici put a crimp in real estat  market  the person save rate tick up  as we hope it    and the fiscal impuls wane   dure the near term  inflat pressur are expect to be more signific  with some pass through of high energi cost to core inflat   over the medium term  these pressur eas  it   s certain possibl for surpris on either side of this baselin   that is  we could see inflat around longer than we now expect or  on the opposit side  we could see demand falter  with  consum retrench in the face of slower hire   i continu to believ that manag the risk of  rise price reduc the potenti cost of mistak  and that suggest some further tighten   but how long that will be necessari  in my view anyway  is uncertain
thank you  mr  chairman   on balanc  econom activ is grow at a solid pace in the fifth district  though auto sale are falter and hous market are cool   on the upsid  employ condit have been strengthen  with sign that the job number are increas even at district factori   outsid of auto and big ticket item though  retail sale  strengthen substanti this month   retail indic that holiday sale are solid  and they   ve becom more op ist about prospect for the first half of         auto sale are weak  though  and suv remain unpopular even after the season   s first snowfal   servic firm are also upbeat  with    revenu and employ grow over the last two month   home sale remain at high level but we are receiv widespread report that activ is deceler  particular in northern virginia where market have been quit robust in recent year   a number of independ report describ    a return to normalci    in residenti real estat market  with hous actual be on the market and not get multipl bid on the first day   manufactur continu to hold it own   although shipment and new order were softer in earli decemb  the hire index was up for our district  and firm have becom notabl more op ist about their earli       prospect  district price pressur seem to have eas somewhat in decemb   although retail price were report to have advanc at the same strong pace as in novemb  outsid the retail sector  servic    price have deceler from octob to decemb   manufactur price gain peak in  novemb in our seri  and our preliminari number show that both price paid and price receiv slow sharpli this month   turn to the nation economi  we   ve receiv a string of favor data sinc our octob meet  suggest both that the economi had consider momentum prior to this fall   s storm and   that the effect of the storm on econom activ outsid the affect region and the energi sector have not been as larg as fear   i   m particular encourag by the continu strength in busi  invest spend in the present quarter  as evidenc by capit good order and the ism number   i   m also encourag by anecdot report of a cool in district and nation hous market   these report are consist with a continu handoff from residenti to busi invest   that said  i   m tempt to paraphras solow  though  and say that the slowdown in  hous appear to be visibl everywher but in the hous activ data    laughter   consum spend has held up quit well   my sens is that the most import sourc of this stabil and strength is household    belief about their real incom growth in the near futur   for this    reason  given the  book forecast for incom growth in the near term  i would not expect a flatten of hous price to serious dampen consum spend   rather  i expect  consist with the  book  consum spend growth to come in on the strong side go forward  with the save rate rise onli slowli  the inflat pictur has also improv notabl sinc our last meet  in my mind   the  octob core pce number was hearten  and inflat expect have been well behav   both survey measur and tip compens spread have come down off the post katrina high they reach earlier this fall  while the inflat pictur is somewhat better  it   leav some room for concern  in my view   this  book forecast a     percent core inflat rate for the first half of        less than the   last  book  but it still make me somewhat uncomfort   with oil price appear to have found a stabl rang in the neighborhood of     a barrel and with natur gas price remain high and volatil  i think it will be sever month befor the risk of pass through can be complet put to  bed   as for the econometr evid about pass through  i   d note that expect regard our polici respons repres a latent variabl that of necess is omit in most econometr exercis  i take less comfort from the econometr evid than you do  presid     our preemption may be requir for the pattern you found in the      s to actual continu to be confirm in the data  in the mean   i think we need to ensur that the public understand our resolv with regard to inflat   and the real fund rate in the neighborhood of   percent is veri like too low for an economi that   s in a sustain expans with relat full resourc util   so i think it   s appropri to follow through today with a    basi point increas in the fund rate
thank you  mr  chairman   there has been littl chang in third district econom condit sinc our last meet   the region economi continu to expand at it  potenti pace  which is somewhat lower than in other part of the countri   payrol employ is increas steadili in our three state  and the tri state unemploy rate fell to     percent in octob  which is it lowest level sinc may of        region manufactur activ continu to expand at a moder pace   the index of general activ in our manufactur survey eas slight to      in novemb from      in octob  although there has been some month to month volatil in the index this year  it has general been near the averag that was record in the     s expans  retail report a slight better sale figur for octob and novemb compar to the same period a year ago   in general  sale of luxuri good and consum electron continu to expand more strong than other line of merchandis  and discount store had better result than mid price depart and specialti store   while construct continu to be a strong sector in our region  we are begin to see earli  sign of moder in the hous market   these sign do not point to a sharp drop  onli a slight soften of demand   as elsewher  permit have declin and real estat agent report slower sale in octob and novemb   some agent also note that the number of exist home on the market has risen and that the number of offer per hous and abov ask price bid have declin  there was also a slight eas in price appreci in each of the three state in the third quarter  and this moder appear to be continu in the fourth quarter  we continu to see sign of higher price for industri good in our region   there was a  sharp increas in the price indic in our manufactur survey in octob   this eas onli slight in novemb and remain near a high point dure this expans   firm also expect price to remain    elev   the futur price indic are high relat to most read dure the expans  and the result of a special survey question indic that cost increas are wide anticip for all input   next year   these expect are widespread across firm   and more widespread than dure the summer period when we ask the same question   inde  while our busi contact expect  continu moder expans in busi activ  rise price beyond those in energi have becom more of a concern for firm in our district  turn to the nation economi  i note that the  book forecast has been revis to show more under strength in the third and fourth quarter compar to last  e   it   s more consist with my own view on the nation economi   incom data over the intermeet period suggest that  the economi retain a good deal of upward momentum   the third quarter preliminari gdp figur  show broad base strength in consumpt and fix invest growth  with strong product gain   despit the disloc from hurrican katrina  we have sturdi under job growth and a  low unemploy rate   consum confid has partial recov from post hurrican low  and consum spend outsid auto continu to advanc at a moder pace   busi spend has also strengthen sinc the summer  and manufactur product and busi invest continu to advanc   in my mind  the risk to growth are slight on the upsid  as i read the data as support continu under strength  the offici inflat number and read on inflat expect have been somewhat reassur over the intermeet period   to date  we   ve seen littl pass through  as a number of  peopl have note  of higher energi price into core inflat  and we   ve also seen some declin in  energi price   in addit  both near term and long term inflat expect have declin a bit  this news is clear favor to the inflat outlook   howev  it seem somewhat at odd with what we   re hear from our busi contact   they indic that they   re face higher input price    and have recent found it somewhat easier to rais their own price in the current environ of quit strong demand   this view has also been support by our own and other manufactur  survey   so i remain concern about inflationari pressur  and i believ that an uptick in inflat is  inde  a risk    therefor  a prudent cours of action today  in my opinion  is to continu to gradual move  rate up   whether such a move is close in on the equilibrium real rate from below or whether such a move will put the real fund rate abov the equilibrium valu or place it in the rang of uncertainti around the long run valu is an interest question   so is how we will explain what we are go to do   but i   ll defer my view on these issu until the second part of our discuss   suffic it to say i  look forward to that    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   what a differ six week can make   at our last meet  the  book offer two altern scenario   stagflat and a consum sen ent slump   which at least from the fourth district   s perspect seem plausibl and worrisom   in earli novemb  we had to consid the possibl that output growth might weaken even as inflat  acceler   fortun  the output and product data that we   ve receiv sinc that meet have been on the upsid  and the inflat news has been general encourag   although there are still  various scenario to worri about today  stagflat and a consum sen ent slump no long appear to  be among them   my own inform gather process dure this intermeet period leav me veri comfort with the  book baselin  which now expect more favor path for output  product  and inflat than it call for at our last meet   i have a few observ about each of these   first  output   the nation pace of econom  activ appear to be on the upsw  even though in my own district the economi appear to remain    on a slower improv trend   banker report that the commerci loan pipelin are fill up  and competit among lender is veri strong   as i said  my district has been trail the nation   the   automobil industri has a larg weight in my district  and recent develop there  though not  unexpect  are pretti dreari  as presid   report   the big three automobil compani  and their supplier are under intens pressur to downsiz and reduc cost  especi labor cost   mani plant close and layoff have alreadi been announc  and the dark cloud hang over the industri are alreadi have advers effect on mani communiti   but most busi leader i speak with outsid of the automobil industri are op ist about their nation market as they look into next year  next i   ll comment on product   the ceo that i talk to are still work veri hard to  generat profit by increas product   i   m amaz by how frequent and uniform ceo talk about effici effort under way in their compani   a natur consequ of the product cultur  of cours  is that busi peopl are watch their head count veri close  even as their sale are expand   hospit execut are especi bullish about their abil to generat signific product gain  and they   ve been ramp up their capit spend on equip and facil   one of my director work for a larg commerci construct compani and report that this is a nationwid trend  final  inflat   retail tell me that they   ve train their custom to shop for bargain onli too well   consum are relentless in their hunt for bargain  and internet shop is grow rapid in popular and make that hunt for bargain easier   retail in the district tell me that  they expect consum to hang back and wait until the bitter end for steeper discount  and those discount are go to inevit rise as christma loom close   consequ  retail expect to turn over their inventori  but they anticip have to give up some of the normal profit margin that    they seek at this  e of the year   discount is extrem intens   sale volum  then  should turn out well  but profit may be disappoint  some manufactur say that they are final get a littl traction with price increas abov and beyond the energi surcharg   but most manufactur that i talk to report that competit remain veri intens and they emphas that they have littl price power   although busi  have had to absorb price increas for mani of their commod input  sever busi execut  note that raw materi price have stop increas for the most part and  in mani instanc  have start to declin  so as i look at the nation economi  i   m veri comfort with the  book baselin   i  expect product growth to hold up rather well next year  along the line of that fa  product growth altern scenario in the  book   although i indic in my report at our last meet that we could see stronger pass through of energi price  i was not hear that from my busi contact in their report this  e around   in fact  mani of them said that the energi and commod   price shock that we   ve experienc in the past two year could move through our economi without elev core inflat rate  the disappear of the stagflat and consum sen ent slump scenario and the emerg of other risk serv as a remind to me that the futur  even the near term futur  is  uncertain   the    percent confid rang surround the  book baselin project is wide enough to includ all of the altern simul   i believ  as a coupl of other have alreadi said  that with anoth move today our polici accommod will have been substanti remov  make the  e and extent of addit firm more uncertain for me   thank you  mr  chairman
okay   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ve been debat whether we should character the expans as vigor or solid   i decid that it   s vigor solid    laughter   on the consumpt front  to give you an idea how strong demand is  my wal mart contact say that    percent of the tvs they sell are now digit  up from   percent last holiday season   they have greater sale also of other higher end   medium and premium   price point   and he say that inventori  if anyth  is on the short side of desir level  particular for the higher end item  a pervas theme in my discuss with busi peopl is that construct cost are rise rather rapid   wal mart say    to    percent  and that seem to be general true across the  economi  accord to my contact   the transport industri  i think  is stretch at this point  for quit some  e there have been problem with rail transport of coal   our contact with a  power compani in the st  loui area said that they   ve been abl to build stock of coal at power plant but the level is still well below the normal  desir level   a contact with a major truck compani said that they have no plan to increas capac in   their truck busi  which is about    percent of the total   they plan a   percent increas in capac in the intermod area   that   s the piggyback busi   and    percent capac expans in the dedic truck busi  which involv truck for particular compani like wal mart  my up contact said that they have been stretch quit tight this holiday season  he mention that dhl has been have sever oper problem at it wilmington  ohio hub   up could not find extra lift  as they call it  on an ad hoc basi and had to have work around to have   enough capac to meet the demand   up is plan to expand it china to u s  capac next year by    percent  which reinforc what   said a few minut ago  there is a risk of disrupt becaus of strike   up   and fedex is right behind   is come to the end of the negoti with their pilot  which has not been go well   the pilot in those     compani are now the best paid in the industri becaus the passeng airlin have reduc pilot    pay   the pilot    union is appar adam in want a larger piec of the profit of the compani  so i think we should not by ani mean rule out the possibl of a strike at up earli next year   my contact there said that the level of frustrat within the compani about the various job action by pilot is veri high   pilot have been call in and say  for exampl  that they   re fatigu and can   t fli  and they have caus a lot of disrupt by tactic of that sort  i think those are the onli comment i want to offer   thank you
whi don   t we break for coffe at this  e and come back in  fifteen minut
presid  n   coffe break
thank you  mr  chairman   let me tri to restart this discuss by say  first   that i larg agre with the  book assess of the economi and  in particular  with the overal posit econom outlook it present   this is consist with the incom data on the nation  economi that we   ve receiv recent and with the preponder of recent report on the district economi as well   notabl  the district is benefit from an overal good year in agricultur  sustain improv in the manufactur sector  and what i would call posit substitut effect stem from hurrican relat disrupt elsewher  which have led  for exampl  to more ship out of the port of duluth superior than otherwis would have occur  more volum for local truck firm  and so forth  one minor differ i might have with the  book outlook pertain to the labor market and the unemploy rate   it seem to me that the forecast for econom growth in      overal is  not terribl differ from what we   ve had in       and         and cumul  the unemploy rate    drop near a full percentag point from the end of      to the end of        use that as a rough guid or rule of thumb  i would think we   d get at least some modest further declin in the rate of  unemploy next year   i would hasten to add   and i think this is potenti a more import and  mayb also a more controversi point   that even if we get that drop in the unemploy rate  it  wouldn   t affect my inflat forecast   in fact  look at the total of the inform avail  i don   t think that the risk to the core inflat outlook are skew one way or the other  and i   m inclin to agre with dave     s assess that inflationari pressur are close to top out  i say this becaus incom data on core inflat have been relat favor  bond market suggest to me that inflat expect remain well anchor  and a lot of polici accommod has been remov  inde  sum up these factor as well as the result from most version of the taylor rule present in the bluebook  calcul with   type interest rate equat  and the  book forecast itself  it seem to me that after this meet we will at least be veri close to the point where we will have rais the feder fund rate suffici for now   thank you
our forecast for the nation outlook has not chang substanti sinc the last meet  and relat to the discuss so far  i guess we   re slight at the stronger end  the recent data have been encourag both here and intern   the under pace of demand growth seem pretti good to us   good enough to rais the probabl of the expans continu at a pace at or slight abov trend   the inflat news has also been reassur  though under inflat is still run somewhat abov what we   d like to see over  e      we believ these condit justifi some further tighten of monetari polici  perhap anoth    to    basi point   we are  therefor  comfort with the expect now built into the  market   and with that monetari polici assumpt  we think the risk to the forecast and to our object are rough balanc   so  relat to septemb and octob  we see somewhat less downsid risk to growth  perhap even some upsid risk  and somewhat less upsid risk to inflat  as this impli  our view is veri close to the  book  let me mention a few other point   the appar strength in product should make us more comfort about the sustain of the expans and a bit less concern about the near  term inflat risk becaus  of cours  if the product growth stay stronger longer  we can be more confid that consum spend will stay reason strong even if a more substanti slowdown in hous materi   scenario in which more moder hous price appreci or some declin in hous price lead to a sizabl increas in the person save rate are probabl less plausibl or less troubl in an environ where consum are more confid in the outlook for the economi or more confid in their futur incom growth  the product news  combin with continu moder in the core inflat number  and the moder in measur of inflat expect  make the inflat outlook somewhat more favor   but against these factor there are other that justifi some continu attent   of cours  overal inflat is still high  even though we expect it to moder   various measur of under inflat are still abov what we would be comfort with over  e   there probabl is still some  energi cost pressur in the pipelin   and the tip deriv measur of inflat expect over the medium term  if you adjust for the carri effect  have not realli move down that much   with   compens growth acceler  we would expect eventu to see some upward pressur on labor cost  though of cours less than would be the case with lower product number   moreov     survey and anecdot report of price behavior  as we read them  suggest that busi are abl to pass on some share of their increas cost   so for these reason  even with the addit tighten price into the market  we probabl face some modest upsid risk to our inflat forecast and to our  object  and we should continu to lean against this risk in what we do and what we say   we don   t see evid yet to support a concern that the path of the nomin fed fund rate now price into the market risk go too far   hous may be slow a bit  but not realli much   other spend indic look strong   probabl stronger than we thought   and the strength is broader than it has been across the compon of gdp   expect real rate don   t suggest a high degre of concern  in our view   it   s just some concern  but not acut concern about the downsid risk to futur growth   if you tri to take out expect inflat from forward rate  it look as if real rate  move up over the    to   year horizon   equiti price  credit spread  and the impli volatil of most asset price don   t seem to suggest a lot of concern about signific deterior ahead in the pace of the expans  although we don   t think the narrow of the term spread itself or the low overal level of the yield curv offer clear guidanc about monetari polici   clear guidanc in term of argu for a softer or firmer stanc than the other fundament might suggest   we   re somewhat more inclin to  take the view that this chang in the structur of term premia suggest we will have to do more than  otherwis would have been the case   so all of this suggest to us that we should continu to tighten further and signal that we think we have still more to do
thank you  mr  chairman   the news over the intermeet period has suggest some shift in the natur of the inflat risk face by the economi   low and stabl core   consum price inflat togeth with declin retail energi price and some continu edg lower     of inflat expect seem to impli a reduc threat from near term feed through of energi price to expect or to core inflat  at the same  e  howev  inform on output and demand indic that the economi remain on a growth track which is expand a littl more quick than potenti suppli   and this is  a trajectori that would increas pressur on resourc at a  e when those resourc are alreadi be fair well employ   the reason for the greater than expect momentum in output are  unclear   some of the strength may repres a more mute respons to hurrican disrupt or energi price than anticip  but much would seem to be relat to under strength in aggreg demand   the upward surpris in demand in the third quarter were global  not just in the unit state   increas in industri commod price and sizabl gain in equiti price around the world evid widespread econom strength and expect that it will persist  ad demand and rise equiti price have provok littl  if ani  offset tighten in financi condit in credit market   long term interest rate global were littl chang on balanc over the intermeet period  and risk spread out the yield curv and across risk categori  continu to be low  reflect the basic op ist outlook of investor  perhap the resili of the global economi to oil price increas and persist expans in global gdp  includ in such laggard as japan  are slowli increas the confid of non financi busi as well   in the unit state  the growth of busi invest has come into line with past relationship with the cost of capit and chang in output  though the level of invest still remain a bit lower than might be expect  as a consequ of this strength  one question is whether the current constel of interest  rate and asset price  includ expect of the fund rate top out in the     to    percent rang here  is tight enough to produc the moder in growth need to keep the economi in the    neighborhood of it potenti and to keep inflat stabl   in the staff forecast and in the market  such a rise in the fund rate is seen as suffici to contain inflat  and that strike me as a reason es   pend further inform   although long term rate haven   t chang much for sever quarter  short  and intermedi   term rate have increas quit a lot and will continu to move higher as we firm polici   these higher rate should exert increas restraint on spend  especi for household that have been reli on borrow at low short term rate to short circuit liquid and incom constraint when buy durabl or hous  the slow in consum credit growth and mortgag loan applic in recent month may  inde  indic that higher short  and intermedi term rate are begin to bite   moreov  perhap as a consequ of the rise in borrow cost  we do see some sign of a cool in hous  market  as mani of you remark   certain the percept about hous market of both builder and buyer have deterior notic in recent month  and the shift in attitud may be particular import when a signific portion of the activ in this market has been link to invest demand   base on these indic and other  a slow of hous price appreci and a moder in construct activ next year seem to be a reason expect   such a slow is a critic element behind the moder in growth next year in the staff forecast  and i suspect in the market   s assess as well  still  we need to see more concret evid that this channel is work as anticip  both  in price and in activ  befor we can be confid that demand is like to moder   nonetheless  the incom inform also reinforc the notion that we can afford to retain the gradual path of  polici tighten as we look for sign that moder is come   with the upward revis to es  structur product growth  the economi is not expand veri much abov it long run    growth of potenti   in addit  the better product and the downward revis to compens data show the increas in busi cost be held in check better than had been evid   and the higher rate of growth of structur product should help to hold down that increas in cost go forward   moreov  the markup of price over unit labor cost have risen appreci in the last two quarter for both nonfarm busi as a whole and  within that categori  for nonfinanci corpor   and those markup are close to the record high of the mid     s  suggest that busi have some room and incent to absorb some of the increas in labor cost that might be come  as a consequ of these develop  i think we can be a littl less concern about the immedi threat of higher inflat  though we still need to focus on forestal the potenti for suppli demand imbal to develop over the medium run   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   the concept of the known unknown came to the nation conscious about a year or two ago  and i sens that it   s veri much in this room today  the baselin forecast call for a veri nice  soft land to potenti growth with contain inflat if we just tighten our polici one or two more turn   i   m certain prepar to accept that forecast for the  purpos of today   s meet  but the uncertainti or the known unknown factor around it are to me quit obvious   to me the risk are clear to the upsid with respect to growth  but surpris may be more balanc with respect to inflat  it is easier to see an upsid growth risk than a downsid one  in larg part becaus the  incom data have been surpris robust  make a slow just a quarter or two away seem a littl bit of a stretch   much of the wane wealth effect on which the baselin is built is due to a slow in the hous market   it is true that some of the indic suggest some moder there  includ a slight edg off of mortgag applic and a sour of home buy attitud   but    when line up against the actual strength shown in home sale themselv  both exist and new    and also price  which have continu to appreci at a doubl digit pace through the third quarter    it is hard to say that the hous market is anyth but robust  a second element of the wealth effect that the  book assum is that the equiti price  appreci will be no more than need to keep the current level of the equiti risk premium about stabl   but again  it is easi to see some upsid potenti here   the equiti risk premium is now abov averag   the recent run up in equiti price  coupl with sustain high level of product growth  an attract profit outlook  and healthi corpor balanc sheet all make it perhap a littl  more like that equiti price will rise rather than fall  and inde  rise more than expect   if this  were to occur  the earn price ratio would declin and the equiti risk premium would return to the  normal rang  and in do so would provid more equiti wealth impetus to the economi than perhap the baselin assum   final  global growth is a surpris to the upsid   as dino indic  equiti price have  shown remark strength global   monetari polici itself has in mani case been somewhat s ul and general financi condit have been support of growth   all of this suggest a bias toward fa  global growth due to accommod financi market broad  on inflat  i judg that the risk to the baselin forecast are perhap a littl better balanc   while the upsid growth risk would certain pressur resourc with inflationari consequ  that is not the entir stori   for one thing  inflat has come in a littl softer recent than we had  expect   second  energi price seem to have flatten  and market particip expect them to moder even further  provid a rapid diminut of the upward momentum to headlin inflat   third  import price seem like to remain contain  and for both energi price and import price     pass through has been relat low   final and import  longer term inflat expect are moder   i would also add in this regard someth that has not been much discuss here  labor compens itself has been on the weaker side  even as resourc util has tighten   and final  the product growth stori  i think  has shown continu robust   in this regard i   d  point out that we talk a great deal about the upward adjust to the structur product growth in the staff forecast  but all they   ve realli done is just to maintain what has happen from      to       so mayb we   ve put too much weight on the temporari downward movement as oppos to just recogn that thing haven   t chang veri much  so given this view of the risk around the forecast  whi do i propos that we accept the  baselin for purpos of today   s decis and communic   first  i am mind that polici work with long and variabl lag   while the risk for us are not total balanc  the greater weight of the evid  i think  is still for a good outcom  given that we have move rate up quit consider  and with inflat expect still well contain  i think there   s no reason to adjust market percept of what we   re like to do go forward   if those two fact did not adher  my judgment might be differ  second  one would have to say that while the hous sector stori is yet to come  there are  as we   ve heard around this tabl  a larg number of anecdot all push primarili in the same direct   support  i would think  the baselin  third  i take some comfort in the fact that the baselin forecast is share rough by most outsid forecast   the  book   not seem to be out of the trend   the blue chip consensus is  that after more than two year of abov trend growth  activ in      is like to moder to it trend rate and perhap a bit below by the end of the year   import  the fed fund assumpt that     underli the blue chip are not distinguish dramat from the  book forecast   presid   has alreadi talk about what happen in chicago at their outlook symposium   again  the   consensus seem quit consist with our forecast from the staff   and the nabe member we met  with in this room not too long ago also expect growth to be in the rang of      to     in       final  i am will to take the baselin as the basi for polici today becaus i recogn that our languag will convey the proper sens of caution to reflect the risk and leav us with the flexibl to respond to other chang   i will delay ani further comment on that  as you have suggest  until the second part of our discuss
thank you  mr  chairman   at each of our last eleven or twelv meet there has been a presumpt in the analysi for sever more move of tighten   and while i agre that a   point increas in the fund rate is appropri for today  i no longer find in our analysi a presumpt of multipl move to rais it further  from q  to q   the rise in core pce price is es  to be     percent in        up to     percent in        and back to     percent in         now  the altern scenario for core pce includ a singl option heavili driven by a presum greater impact of rise energi price on core inflat  and as i indic to presid    i   m interest in go back and reread that analysi   the   book forecast is for the fed fund target to rise to     percent and be maintain at that level   i   just look at the chart in exhibit   that was hand out at the break and compar it to the chart that  was in the bluebook  and the market seem to be even more sure that we will overshoot and then retreat with respect to the fed fund rate  i share presid  n   s analysi with respect to the equilibrium real rate and the extent to which our fed fund level relat to the rang of valu under the common use taylor rule   i    think there   s a legi  concern about the effect a prematur paus would have on inflationari expect  and i take that veri serious   but  again  i do not see yet in our analysi where that  need to drive our concern   therefor  unlik in previous meet  where there was a presumpt of multipl increas  i think that perhap after today we would need to look for a justif for such increas   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i want to echo dave     s analog of tide of great joy in this forecast   i think the upward revis in growth and the downward revis in inflat are develop that we all welcom at this point in the econom expans   as i tri to assess some of the inform to see where i would want to come out on polici  i tend to take an approach similar to the one presid   took  in say  where do we stand at this point in our effort to remov accommod  and where are we go as we move forward   in the altern scenario laid out in this  book  there is realli onli one where long term inflat expect lose their anchor and which therefor give me much concern   as i look at where we   are on inflat  i was struck that there is some good news and some bad news and that there are current risk on both side   last year we saw inflat come up from extraordinarili low level     move up from   percent to over   percent   it rebound quick  and i was one who was quit concern by how quick inflat had move up   in the last six month  though  it has been     percent  which sound like a fair good area for it to be in   but the fact that it rebound so fast   clear indic that we alway have to be veri alert to develop on that front  becaus price can move rapid  the energi pass through  i think  is a risk for higher inflat   i   d love to see the analysi that san francisco has done on that issu becaus  depend on what level of cost are pass through  i      think we could see real concern about disrupt and risk to the economi go forward   as a  consequ  for exampl  of believ that energi price are go to stay in a high rang for sever year or see the possibl of outright shortag in area like natur gas   we   ve also seen that other central bank in the world are now expect stronger growth and  higher inflat in their economi   the ecb  european central bank   as was mention earlier  final rais it polici rate  and even the bank of japan is come out of a zero rate world   so some of the cushion we   ve had worldwid may be moder  and that could produc more risk on the upsid on inflat   on the other hand  when i look at what has been happen with job growth and labor  compens  i continu to be struck by how moder the growth in compens has been   the product stori is clear one reason for this   the number continu to amaz me at this point in  the cycl    it   s easi to achiev product gain in a compani earli on when you have excess  capac   but this mani year into an expans  it realli take a ton of attent and effort   anoth thing that often come up in my convers with busi execut is this   they are sit at veri high level of profit and cash flow generat  and when you ask them about their main challeng  they still say their primari challeng is to maintain profit growth   if you start to dig into that  you find that it   s beyond just manag wage cost and look at capit   the lesson they  learn in the      s in term of realli chang the way busi process are run are continu to play a role in all of the decis they   re make on issu like inventori manag   not tie up capit either in inventori store or in warehous capac  as i look at last month   s number  inventori sale ratio hit record low   so clear    busi are continu to learn more and more about how to keep inventori level veri  veri  low   even though they   re tri to custom the deliveri of product   and they are do that    through better inform system and better order manag system  they also are focus a great deal on qualiti control  particular in servic and retail busi  and in busi servic where that is a key differenti with the competit   but better qualiti also has major cost benefit  becaus it reduc error and the need to redo work and it focus on the  eli of deliveri   and these are the kind of valu beyond price that custom are rate as increas import   so firm get both greater effici and valu ad for their custom base more than in the past  and final  outsourc   and i   m talk not intern but simpli outsid of the core enterpris   is a busi practic that evolv in the      s and has proven to be veri import   in the  old day when you ran a big corpor that was vertic integr  there were cost center  throughout the organ and it was veri hard for cfos to get a handl on control cost   now that the cultur has becom    if it isn   t a core function  you ought to tri to outsourc it     the process of renegoti with the contractor annual or semi annual or everi three year and of go out for other bid put continu pressur on attain product improv and a favor cost payback   but when the function was embed in the bigger organ  the social polit some  got in the way and made it difficult to wring out the cost   the fact is that firm now tri not to do everyth  and to outsourc function unrel to their core busi   that this has becom an ingrain practic in mani compani is anoth theme i   m hear   so  in short  i   m  find that chang in busi practic are the focus of a lot of compani   and they believ that despit higher cost  they are go to be abl to improv the valu with modest price increas go forward   pull all of that togeth  i tend to think that we are veri close to the end of the increas in  interest rate that we need to implement   there are risk on both side  but it strike me  base on the  book forecast  that we   re get to full potenti in a veri order way   and as was mention    a minut ago  accord to the bluebook  the real fed fund rate  that we would have with a    basi point increas today is at the midpoint of the rang of the staff   s es  of equilibrium   also  it   s abov the fund rate deriv from the polici rule for all of  the altern   so we are close to where i think we need to be  given the forecast   as a result  i think we realli do need to talk about how to make this transit and chang our communic
mr  madigan
mr  chairman  earlier you refer to the comed talent of my two colleagu to the right   for my part  in draft the bluebook over the past week  i fear that i may have been engag in tragedi    laughter   that is  there certain was drama depict a protagonist   your truli   engag in a signific struggl end in ruin or utter disappoint   for the remaind of my remark  i   ll be refer to the materi that was hand out at the break   over the intermeet period  indic of consider momentum in econom activ led market particip to build in a littl more near term monetari tighten  as shown in the upper left hand panel of exhibit     market particip now appear to believ that the fund rate will peak at about    percent in mid      but be roll back slight thereaft   the consensus blue chip forecast releas on decemb    not shown  also indic a median anticip that about three more quarter point move are in store  but those forecast don   t have the committe eas until earli        for the near term  as shown in the upper right hand panel  fed fund futur indic that investor are all but certain that you will firm anoth    basi point today   they see about an    percent chanc of anoth such step in januari and put better than even odd on one more move in march    and seem everyon recogn that your statement is in play today   the financi press and market letter in recent day have devot most of their monetari polici analysi not to your rate adjust but to your choic of word   as shown in the middl left hand panel  the desk   s survey indic that most primari dealer expect that today you will modifi or drop the refer to    accommod    monetari polici and that half look for the    measur pace    languag to be chang or delet  but there is littl indic that market particip anticip a structur chang to your risk assess   a case for firm polici today is outlin in the middl right hand panel  accord to staff es   the economi appear to have littl remain slack  with    the materi use by mr  madigan are append to this transcript  appendix          the unemploy rate in the vicin of the nairu and real gdp just a fraction of a percent below the level of it potenti   moreov  the economi appear to have consider momentum that  without further firm  could carri aggreg demand beyond the level of potenti output   such momentum might be seen as consist with a real feder fund rate that is still relat low   as shown in the lower panel  the real fund rate is within  but near the lower end of  the rang of staff es  of it equilibrium   with some of the indirect effect of higher crude and natur gas price still in prospect and like provid some impetus to the inflationari process  you  might be particular concern about the implic of resourc pressur for inflat   on the whole  though  incom data over the intermeet period have seem broad consist with your earlier expect that the economi and inflat would evolv in such a way as to warrant further measur firm   and financi market have infer from those develop and your polici communic that a quarter point move today is a sure thing   a more difficult question   one that could bear particular on your statement this afternoon   is how much more tighten is like to prove necessari   even recogn the substanti firm of polici to date as well as the lag in the effect of polici   an issu flag by a number of you this morn   you may still believ that consider further polici tighten lie ahead   if so  you might be attract to the languag of the bluebook   s altern c  shown in the right hand column of exhibit    in the rational section  row    this announc would point to vigor growth in the real economi and would retain the refer to polici accommod and robust under product growth   the recent strength in aggreg demand might suggest a relat high level for the equilibrium fund rate and thus impli that polici remain accommod   and  certain  the remark figur for the third quarter could support a judgment that under product growth remain robust   in row    altern c would point to    relat high level of resourc util    as anoth reason for polici firm   in row   and    this altern would retain both the form and substanc of the committe   s assess of risk from recent polici statement  includ the judgment that polici accommod could probabl continu to be remov at a measur pace   market would be quit surpris by such an announc  and rate would like back up consider   if  howev  you believ that the end of this tighten cycl is not far off   or if you simpli believ that the  e has come to jettison the refer to accommod  polici and some other stale languag   then you may prefer the word of altern b   this statement would differ signific from recent announc   as shown in row    the committe would indic that the expans appear solid despit the effect of the hurrican and high energi price  while delet the refer to accommod polici and under product growth   in row    the statement would again acknowledg that core inflat has been low of late and that longer term inflat expect remain contain   it would express concern  howev  that    possibl increas in resourc util as well as elev energi price have the potenti to add to inflat pressur         the assess of risk would be modifi notabl   rather than make the arguabl tautolog assert that the risk appear balanc assum    appropri monetari polici     it would indic that the    committe judg that some further measur polici firm is like to be need to keep the risk to the attain of both sustain econom growth and price stabil rough in balanc      i emphas    measur    becaus view on the committe regard the inclus of this word clear vari   as a staff memorandum indic last week  the chairman request that in your comment in the upcom round you express your prefer on this score  in your consider of this matter  you might see    measur    as repres a needless restraint on your possibl action   but  as shown in row    the committe would in effect also indic that   as has alway been the case   the risk assess is not a commit but a condit expect and that  should incom data diverg from expect  the committe would commensur recalibr it actual and anticip action   moreov  you might see littl prospect that polici will actual  need to move in    basi point step but be concern that  if the committe were to drop the word now  especi in the context of the other propos chang to the statement  market particip could conclud that you saw the potenti need for such larg move   one factor that could influenc the committe   s decis about the new assess of risk languag is whether you anticip ani problem adjust that languag as circumst evolv in come month   this appear unlik to be a major problem   if  contrari to current expect  more aggress polici tighten come to appear appropri  the committe could chang the refer in row   to someth like    consider further tighten      or  should the end point seem to move out in  e a littl  the committe could simpli repeat the propos assess  and  final  if and when it appear that polici has reach a rest point  the committe could firm a final    basi point and chang row   to someth like the follow      under these circumst  the committe judg that the current stanc of polici rough balanc the risk to the attain of both sustain econom growth and price stabil      and at that point the    measur    terminolog could be honor discharg from servic   given the larg number of chang in the announc propos for altern b  it is difficult to be confid in anticip the market reaction that it would engend  inde  investor also seem to be rather uncertain about the market effect of this afternoon   s announc  but market are strive for complet by offer insur on the direct effect of your immin polici action   specif  an option is be trade on the chang in the    year treasuri yield in a two hour window around your announc today   the price of that option suggest a one third probabl that the    year yield will move one way or anoth by more than     basi point   laughter   for our part  the staff   s guess is that the announc propos for altern b would like boost interest rate  but not by much   final  let me say a word about procedur   as you will recal  the survey of the fomc that the staff conduct last month regard statement languag includ     among other thing  question on the scope of the committe   s polici vote   that is  whether the committe should vote on just the direct and the risk assess  or whether the vote should be expand to cover all forward look element or the entir statement   in prepar for a possibl chang  chairman  span has ask the staff to provid to the committe earli next year a memorandum that will discuss the pros and con of altern approach to this issu   thank you   that conclud my prepar remark
question for      if there are no question  it impli that everyon agre with everyth you just said    laughter
i expect no less    laughter
it   s interest to listen to the discuss around this tabl  today becaus the under fact are realli somewhat differ from what we had perceiv at our last meet   there is evid that the economi is move at a pace and in a direct that i don   t think we would have anticip six week or two month ago  especi in the context of the  hurrican   the under real rate of growth is realli power   we can see it in the unit state but just as import  if not more so  we are begin to  see it abroad   japan is final get it act togeth  as best i can judg   for a long period of  e   japan had veri poor financi result within it bank system  and while they had a nonperform  loan statist  it certain wasn   t anyth like the type that we would calcul   therefor it look as though the economi was a fragil one  with a bank system that was larg reliant on real estat collater whose price continu plummet   moreov  the state of financi intermedi in japan was high dubious becaus bank is the onli vehicl they have for intermedi  there realli isn   t an altern mean of move save into invest   howev  the japanes bank system has final gotten to a point where it look like a regular  old fashion bank system  intermedi is now go on   a lot of the piec are begin to come togeth   and the reason   this is import is that for a veri long  e we   ve been disregard japan as an intern forc     even though it   s the second largest economi in the world   that   s becaus it just never move   as a consequ  the japanes economi wasn   t an import factor in the global outlook but it now seem to be move in a favor direct  and we   re even get stir in europ  where germani  though still in veri serious troubl  is clear show some sign of improv   obvious  their unit labor cost have stabil  and the impact of their veri serious structur problem seem not to be get wors  when one look around the world  most economi are improv   in the unit state  some of the old fashion data  as i was mention to   ye day  are show some veri strong sign   one exampl is that moribund industri which use to be the cut edg fifti year ago  the steel industri   durabl good  no matter how you cut it  are still larg made of steel  and those  market are quit strong   scrap price are up   u s  steel is book it order signific far out into the futur   there is buoyanc there and also in the nonferr metal market   market we never use to worri about  but they still do matter  the reason it is tough to get similar inform out of  say  the high tech industri is that   while they are grow veri rapid  the dispers from one compani to the other is dramat   in other word  if you get an industri growth rate of    percent  say  you might find that one compani grow    percent for two year and then it growth goe down to   percent and vice versa for some  other firm   so  with the technolog chang so rapid  you can   t get the anecdot read from a  lot of those compani the way you do on the old fashion industri where noth chang all that much and you have a reason good base for make judgment  it   s hard to imagin an american economi that is as balanc as this one is   but most import  through all of this  we are liter see some resist to the upsid pressur on  inflat   i find the most credibl evid on this in the forward tranch of the    year treasuri    note   everi  e pressur begin to move up the implicit rate on the   year matur be issu nine year out  when the rate get to somewhat over   percent it run into resist  what i think is happen relat to the discuss that i put on the tabl last meet about the signific move of educ workforc into market economi from central plan economi   specif the old soviet union  and now far more import china  and to a limit extent india  which still has characterist of central plan as well   at the meet six week ago  we had no data at all about the rate of chang at which that transit is occur but it   s clear a  level adjust   and the rate at which it is happen is a determin of chang in unit labor cost and  therefor  price chang or inflat  some addit work has been done by     s group  especi on china  in tri to get a judgment about the movement of worker from the central plan sector of the economi to the competit free market sector   that work indic in rough proxi   grant  these are extrem crude data   that the rate of chang has been rise for a number of year and that there   not yet seem to be ani evid that it has peak   now  ordinarili that would not be a great insight becaus   the data are so poor   but if you   re look for explan of whi we   re run into upsid resist on price   everi  e we get strong demand and increas short term rate  long term rate don   t want to move   this global of the workforc seem to be a factor  if you look at the chart on longer term rate today  they go up  they run into troubl  they come down   there   s a ceil out there appar  which suggest that at least for the  e be  inflat expect are clear contain   but judg from the real  e price data  they   re also soft   and they are soft around the world  not just in the unit state   we   re now get price   pressur in some place   in a coupl of countri that are unbeliev expansionari and have irrespons polici  we   re see inflat rate get up to   or   percent   the reason i rais the    issu befor is that twenti year ago those rate would have been    percent   we   re not get ani of that   so this is not a u s  issu   it has to be a global one   this suggest to me that we have a veri unusu situat where convent analysi tell us veri concret the follow  we   re run out of spare capac  thing are tighten up  and  wage rate are under pressur  though not so much in the skill area in the unit state as in the lesser skill area where we   re begin to see wage rate rise   inde  that is evid in the seri we run use the wage and salari data in the nipa  nation incom and product account  account   which of cours are tie to virtual full coverag for the unemploy insur system   and the employ and implicit hour data that come out of the establish labor market survey   that survey report data on averag hour earn for product or non supervisori  worker   use those data and the total from the nipa  one can infer the averag hour wage for supervisori worker or skill worker   that is  the    percent of the workforc not includ in the averag hour earn data   in the last sever month  after have run well abov    percent  the  supervisori hour wage rate has come down quit signific  so that the ratio of wage for supervisori or skill work to that for lesser skill work is begin to stabil   and that suggest that we   re begin to get a littl more pressur on lesser skill wage and somewhat less pressur  on skill wage   these data are veri interest in the sens that they   re base essenti on aggreg data  and they are someth we never realli look at previous   but i think they tell us a great deal about what   s go on in the labor market  and these data involv develop that we don   t ordinarili look at  this lead us to a veri interest question as to where polici should go from here   let   s say we knew for certain that inflationari expect were held down and that core inflat was reason well suppress   the issu would still aris as to whether  with this global phenomenon      we are construct a situat in which interest rate are so low that we are encourag  or inde caus  under specul activ that will creat realli serious imbal in the overal system  so we   re deal with a littl more than the question of where inflat is go becaus  as i have mention previous  someth that has becom veri evid in recent year is that overal   asset price worldwid  both equiti and debt  are rise a good deal fa  than product price   and   they are pick up becaus of   inde  the rise in asset price is be engend by   the fact that  interest rate are get ever lower   interest rate in emerg market economi are as low as one can rememb   and asid from the surpris high equiti premium in the unit state  we have veri signific upward momentum in asset valu   this is where the veri import question of  whether monetari polici should target asset price come in   the current situat is a veri   interest case becaus i would say that we ought to be tighten at this particular point but not  target the asset price increas   but it is clear the potenti for specul activ   and it effect  on asset price   which is generat an assess that we need to move  as far as evalu the outlook for the overal economi  so where i come out on all of this is that unless we move a littl to tighten up a bit further  i   think we   re take a risk of the system begin to run fa  than we would like   i conclud  as a  consequ  that we need to move today   i think we have to indic  as the statement for altern b suggest  that we   ll move again in januari   i would hope that after the statement come out today the march futur for the feder fund rate do not come down   i would prefer that futur rate move up a bit  even if it   s our expect   and it   s a plausibl expect   that the januari increas will  be the end of our tighten   i can conceiv of that occur  but i think we have more here to be concern about than just the balanc of risk in the unit state and the issu of whether we are    get product price inflat or not  and i think the odd are that we are not   but we are run into the question of whether we are open up a veri signific potenti for a major increas in asset expans   rememb that when we talk about liquid  we   re talk about an increas in overal purchas power  and common stock as well as bond are  in a sens  currenc   and if price of  bond and stock go up  that will result in a veri high degre of liquid in the system  which may or may not hit on product price   frank  i think it   s unlik to do so  we have a global market and a global environ here  which i don   t think we yet fulli  understand   in fact  i know we don   t fulli understand   nevertheless  i think we need to tighten to be  sure that we   re safe from these specul incurs   i believ the risk of not do so are far greater than tighten a littl bit more than probabl in retrospect we would have had to do   so i think we ought to move forward  my own person view is that we should not drop the word    measur    from the statement becaus that would impli that we   re realli begin to see develop out there that are move veri rapid  and i think it   s too soon to conclud that   my argument  i think  are larg precautionari in the sens that there is someth signific happen around the world that we  cannot as yet fulli explain  but it is one of the possibl scenario that has a high element of risk in it  and i think we have to address ourselv to that just from a risk manag point of view  so i conclud that we ought to move the fund rate target up    basi point  which i think is the general consensus around here  and i believ the statement that we have in    b    fulfil our  object with regard to communic that   i would be cautious about indic at ani  e that  we are about to end the increas in the fund rate  even though we may well be do that  becaus that will bring mortgag rate down through the usual effect on the    year note   i think whatev froth there is in the hous market is becom contain at this stage  and it   s get contain    larg becaus mortgag rate have move up and are begin to have an impact   rememb  it   s not onli the    year fix rate but adjust rate as well   and short term rate have move up quit signific and are impact the market   if we can contain the presumpt hous bubbl  then we have a realli remark run out  there   but the real danger  in my judgment   where i think the risk lie   is in move rate down too  soon   when i say move down  i mean that when we stop tighten  the long term rate are go   to come down   and in my view we have to be care about how that happen and what the impact is on the economi   inde  our action are go to have an impact on the world at larg becaus they will affect what everybodi     when i sit in the g   meet  it   s veri evid that what the feder reserv   with respect to polici has a quit signific impact on the ecb and the bank of  england   the reason i know that is they tell me that   so  what we do is go to be quit import  so  my propos is a    basi point increas in the fund rate target and the statement languag of  altern b   who would like to open up the discuss
mr  chairman  i support your recommend  and i guess i can go with the languag   the one thing that your comment rais in my mind relat to row    the rational part of the statement  where it talk about possibl increas in resourc util   i wonder if we shouldn   t have a statement that talk about the carri on effect of past accommod polici becaus that   s what you   re realli talk about when you get into asset valu issu   i   m not say we have to do that  but that came to my mind as i listen to your comment   other than that  i   m fine with your propos
let me just respond   we have a problem if we move too quick in chang that we make   this statement is a veri signific chang
right   i don   t disagre with you   that   s the onli thing that occur to me   but i   m fine with your propos   i think we need to keep go
i support your recommend  mr  chairman  and i support altern b   we   ve been engag in a veri construct dialogu over the last week or two   or sever week    about how to remov some of the element of our statement that have been mainstay for some  e   i think it   s import for the rational paragraph to end with a refer to inflat pressur remain a concern   i think the risk statement the way it   s formul in row   accomplish it task in the most sensibl and straightforward way  by clear just state outright what we think is go to  be requir to maintain balanc risk  with regard to the word    measur     when it was origin deploy it clear meant less than or equal to    basi point   i   m not quit sure it retain that strong an associ to that   i think it   s unlik in the current situat that drop    measur    would be interpret as open the door for a    basi point move  but i don   t have a strong opinion one way or anoth   so i   m happi either way regard the word    measur     look ahead  i think that the challeng for us is go to be how to communic a reaction   function  mean how the pattern of incom econom data is go to map into our choic of a polici rate   in particular  the challeng for us is go to be how to communic about that reaction  function when we get to a point where we want to rest for a meet or two   that discuss is obvious for anoth day  but i think it will be import to avoid languag at that  e that encourag the public to place too high a probabl on the rate remain unchang for an extend period   i say that becaus if the public thought we were lock in for a long  e  it might undesir     dampen the yield curv   s sensit to incom data   that would be unfortun   so  those are my comment on the statement   again  i support your recommend
i support your recommend  too   you know  in the e mail discuss  that have gone on with regard to the various iter of this statement  i think a lot of interest  idea have come out   and they all revolv around where we are on the spectrum in term of the  question  are we close to the end of this current tighten cycl   has the campaign realli chang  and it   s a campaign with a lot more forward momentum than some of us might have agre with   for quit a while i have been of the view that inflat trend  though they pop up with energi  seem moder overal on the core rate   i   ve felt that low under interest rate were encourag risk take in market that would be inappropri at some point   and that   s been one  reason whi i   ve thought that the track we   ve been on now for thirteen meet or so was the right  track   i continu to believ that   and i was pick up some flavor of that in your discuss of your think  i have some sens of agreement with what you said  to the extent that i follow all of it  so i   m in the camp that   s perfect comfort with the altern b formul   i   m not in the camp that think we might need a new campaign here   i would think that some further tighten is consist with risk minim  given overal market psycholog right now and given what we  see in our forecast  as i thought about the various formul of altern b that we   ve been present with  i   thought there were a lot of differ issu at stake  not just the word    measur      one was whether  we should remov the refer to    accommod      i came out on balanc that we should remov     accommod     given that i think we   re current in a rang where we   re unsur that we will need a whole lot more tighten and  therefor  we   re probabl less accommod than we were two or     three meet ago   remov    accommod    could be taken in the other direct  though   by  take out    accommod    market could say     aha   they are on a campaign upward      regardless of where they think the current sens of polici is  they could believ that we might want to be even more aggress   but i think the rest of the statement moder that possibl suffici that take out    accommod    is consist with my think    then there were some other altern that came up in the discuss back and forth   we  had been use product growth on the demand side as a demand acceler   you can think of  the way we see product growth current as an expans of suppli and  therefor  a cushion against inflat   and a coupl of peopl did suggest that   to me that had some appeal   i   m not  go to suggest modifi the statement onlin or in the meet here  but if we continu to see an  expans of product move forward and it is a cushion against inflat  this is someth we might want to think about as a factor to add to our assess of the current situat  should we use the word    some    to modifi    measur polici firm      a lot of peopl thought we should  and it end up get into altern b   i think that   s the right way to go  should we retain    measur      i could live with    measur    be there  i could live with take it out   with the use of    some     i think it   s a littl easier to keep it in becaus to me it has less of a feel that    measur    mean more than a coupl addit polici tighten  and final  the statement use    like    in the refer to further tighten move   that    some further measur polici firm is like to be need      that may be a littl more posit about the number of further move than i   m comfort with   i can go with it   i could also go with someth like    some further measur polici firm may be need     which i think was presid     s formul      so all in all  i   m in agreement   i think we could go either way on five or six of these differ word   taken togeth  the propos languag say what i   d like to say   that is  it say we   re at a  point where there   s enough uncertainti about whether we   re accommod or not that we can take    accommod    out   and we   re send a messag that we may tighten a coupl more  e  but  we   re certain go to look at the data and weigh both of our under goal   so that   s a long wind way of say i agre with you    laughter
thank you  mr  chairman   i guess i   m go to be an outlier here   let me  start by first say that i agre with the    basi point increas   as for the languag  i think everyon in the room agre that we don   t know at this  e what the path of polici is go to be next year  the data and the forecast are go to determin that   we   ve said this mani  mani  e   so to me the object of the statement is to give us maximum flexibl at this point and not lock us into one cours of action or anoth   it should not give the impress that we   re necessarili veri near the end of the tighten cycl   i agre with your comment in that i think the risk are skew toward the need for more tighten  and i think we have to be veri care at this point for the reason that you mention   to  me altern b in the bluebook goe much of the way toward accomplish this   i think it was art put togeth  now  to my ear   and i emphas    to my      the phrase    some further measur polici  firm    might be interpret as impli that the sequenc of rate hike is near over   there   s a possibl that it   s near over  but i don   t think there   s ani assur that it will be   so my  prefer is to just say    further polici firm    without either    some    or    measur      but of the two word  if we take out one  i would take out    measur    at this point      measur    is now interpret     in a way that i think is differ from what we origin intend   now it primari mean is onli a     basi point increas at the next meet  and accord to     s memo  the market seem to think there   s a veri high probabl of two more increas   so in my judgment  sinc we   re now   make major chang in the statement  this is a good opportun to remov the term    measur      i think it has outliv it use  as of today  we will have increas the fed fund target thirteen  e in a row by    basi point   so our statement signal further polici tighten  certain  at the januari meet   and it   s difficult for me to understand  after we   ve move the fund rate up thirteen  e in a row by    basi point how market particip would expect us to increas it in januari by more than    basi point   even without the term    measur    in there   so in my judgment  this is the ideal  e to take it out
if i could  i   d like to respond to that just to give you the other  side of the argument   the fact that we are make a signific chang in the statement is the reason whi they might conclud that we   re also chang the    to     and i think that we want to keep ourselv flexibl in that regard   in my judgment  the risk of that interpret get into the  marketplac and caus a much stronger respons than we   d ever expect is high   and i   m not sure  whi we can   t remov    measur    in januari  for exampl   in other word  there   s no rush to phase out the statement   by march this statement will be long sinc gone  have had   how would you put  it    a respect inter or whatev    laughter   but i think we   re underes  the size of the chang we   re make here  we   re so use to market not respond at all   i think there   s a littl more tentat out there   peopl are not quit certain  which mean that there is a greater chanc of a strong market respons   or perhap more accur  there is the chanc that the market will respond in one way first and then    minut later will go wholli in the other direct   we   ve seen that type of reaction in the past   we haven   t seen that recent     i   m a littl uncomfort about that phenomenon in this context   as you say  our knowledg at this point is a littl sketchi in term of what the market reaction will be   but i can go either way on  the word    measur    myself   i just think it   s better to keep it in now and then take it out later
well  i   ve thought about both side of this a great deal  and i understand that argument   i just think we   re at the point where it   s better to get all the chang behind us  so i   d   do it now   that   s a judgment call
if you can guarante that the market will    laughter
if i could guarante that  i wouldn   t be here    laughter
presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i agre with the recommend to rais the feder fund rate target by   percentag point  and i can accept the languag in altern b as it is draft here   if i were the polici czar on this  i would make an argument to take out    measur    on the ground that we want to at least alert market particip to the prospect that we   re get close to end the more or less automat   percentag point increas  becaus we   re get close to have  remov all of the polici accommod that we need to remov   presid   made the other side of the argument for remov    measur     and i took your comment as implicit work in the  same direct   so i think    measur    ought to come out  if not at this meet  soon  it seem to me that it certain has about outliv it use  i would also  if i had my druther  replac    like    with just    may    or    may well      but as i said  i can accept this languag as draft  becaus i don   t have ani special insight as to whether market particip are go to like one word better than anoth   but of cours  howev the market    happen to react  the relat prompt releas of the minut will help becaus the market will get a more complet pictur of our think within a relat short period of  e
mr  chairman  i listen veri care to what you said   in       i sold my money manag busi becaus i figur i could no longer beat the hous   for    year i was a market oper  so i   m veri sensit to the power of market and the issu you rais  although i   think it   s a veri riski busi for the fomc to discuss how monetari polici might impact asset price   yet you   re right in term of the power  the liquid  and what that   s do to affect real econom behavior  so i look forward to that discuss  in think about this statement  i want to vote for the   point increas announc in the first  sentenc   i think the one sentenc statement in row   in altern b say all that need to be said     the economi is solid  period   that   s good news   in row    i would prefer to say whi core inflat has stay relat low  becaus we talk about it at this tabl   it has remain low for two reason   becaus of competit pressur and still robust growth in product  and i think we ought to insert that   those are the fact  and we just talk about them at length   and i suggest that kind of languag when i sent in my note   in the word of the assess of risk  i think there is an interest trade here   we   re take out    accommod     which is a signal   one could make the argument to remov the word     measur      i respect the argument that were just made   to mitig the oper word    like    i  think we could achiev the object by just say    further measur polici firm may be need    rather than    is like to be need      that leav us plenti of option  and i can honest say that i feel it may be need  i cannot honest say it will like be need   but then  again  i will not have a vote next  e   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   i support the    basi point increas   in my view  leav    measur    in is wise becaus it provid continu with past statement   also  i think take it out would be read as a hint to the market that we would serious consid a    basi point increas  and i don   t think that   s necessari or desir  i am inclin to believ that we should replac    is like to    with    may     and my argument goe this way   this is a chess game  and we have a bunch of move ahead of us here   in term of the like polici adjust in januari  i   m not will to bet my hous   or even the equiti in my  hous   but i am will to make a      even money bet that we   ll want to rais the fund rate anoth    basi point in januari   but as we go out further and look at march  i   d probabl not make a      bet but a     bet   and for may mayb onli a     bet   and the question is  when is the best   e to replac    is like    with    may      if we do it now  we can pretti much recycl the same statement  if we want to do so  wherea if we were to substitut    may    for    is like    in januari or march  the market will ask what kind of signal that is   i think the read would be     they are go to pass and not rais the fund rate next  e      that may not be the signal we want to send   on the other hand  if we leav in the word    is like     at some point we   re go to be face with the  problem of want to pass on a rate increas but have said in the previous statement that an increas    is like      so that would be my argument for substitut    may    for    is like    at this meet
the onli thing i would say in respons to that is that if we  chang    is like    to    may    at this meet  we   re go to get a bond market ralli  which we   re not go to find help in contain the specul in the hous market   so i think it   s more an issu not of what our intent are but how the market is like   i shouldn   t use the word    like        laughter    to react   what we   re tri to do essenti is to get a soft land come in from the top   market tend to over respond  as we   ve seen too often   say    may    impli that we may not  move in januari  and that will bring the structur of the yield curv down quit measur   and i think that will open up hous price specul  which will creat problem for us   in my view  it is  perfect credibl that we may choos to make januari our last increas   and if we do  as   said  we have the sentenc in row   there   that   s it purpos  look  if this economi slow down signific  the market will adjust befor our next meet  and whatev we say will be almost irrelev   that   s what we   re deal with   it   s essenti play the short term game and tri to guess what the    year note is go to do relat to what we   re do   i happen to think it   s a riski activ  even though it   s perfect credibl that januari could be our last boost in the fund rate
i don   t disagre with that  and that   s whi i said i would be will to make a substanti bet that we will want to increas the fund rate in januari   and i think it would be  unfortun to send a signal otherwis   but i am worri about the sequenc of these statement and the advantag of make minim chang in order to avoid mislead the market   what i   m say is that there is a tension between those two object
well  i think we   re all in agreement that we want to get out from under this languag as soon as feasibl and with as littl disrupt as feasibl   and we   re  guess in a lot of area   we just have no way of anticip certain thing   we   re all go in the same direct   the question is how fast we get there   governor
thank you  mr  chairman   first  i accept your recommend for a     basi point move   on your analysi of asset price  i think it is notabl that over the last ten year   or  more than ten year   we   ve had a great moder in both gdp and also inflat  but at the same     e  as you point out  asset volatil hasn   t come down   actual  the price level with respect to equiti has gone up   this support your thought that go forward we   re like to be talk about asset price more  without target them   to the point of today   s discuss  i rather like altern b  after the back and forth  as it sit  on the page   i think it is no longer fair to say that polici is accommod   i believ we are close to  or well into the neutral rang   in my view  most of the data that we   ve seen tend to support that  notion   if we take the refer to accommod polici out  i think we do need to consid what is appropri for section    the forward look languag   and  in particular  the phraseolog    some further measur polici firm is like to be need    strike me as get just the right balanc  as i  think you were say as well   the word    measur    i think has come to mean    basi point  and i believ it   s import to hold on to that notion if we take out    accommod     second  on the issu of how much more we have to do  i tend to think it may be one or two  more move  similar to the expect built into the  book and the market  which strike me as  appropri in support the concept of    some further      so  even though it   s a mouth  i like the    some further measur polici firm      on the    may    versus    is like     i think it   s import to hold on to    is like    becaus that   s actual our best judgment   that further tighten is like   if we get into januari and we are much  less certain  then we can dial it back to    may      but i think    is like    is a more accur signal and i would support that word   and final  though peopl don   t focus on it too much  we have the escap valv that you just talk about  the last sentenc   we   ve gone through lot of iter of this statement back and forth  one of our colleagu feel as though he   s been in a great tragedi or a comedi of error    laughter      but i think we   ve end up in a reason good place  and i   d like to stick with the languag of altern b as written  as you propos
thank you  mr  chairman   first  let me say that i support the    basi point  increas today   and i give my sympathi to    who has heard our mani differ viewpoint in the last week   i think he has done a good job of tri to get all our idea out here in a reason balanc   my initi feel was that i realli didn   t want to keep the word    measur    in the  statement  i want to drop it as part of this chang   but for the reason everybodi has suggest  i can accept the word in altern b as it is now  mr  chairman  you talk about some of the risk to the long term side of the market   i think that is a serious concern becaus so much of the price these day seem not to involv look at the longer term risk  and it   s so critic to what is current drive invest and risk take   and for  that reason  i guess i   d like to leav the word as they are now   but the big chang that i would like to  see is a move away from forward look languag as we get to the point where there is more  uncertainti about futur polici   it was easi for the last thirteen meet to say     we   re on a trend  the fund rate is way too low and we have to get it back up      so it was easi for us to signal ahead   but as we signal ahead  the market look at what we were say we were go to do as oppos to what the data were say we would do   we  in effect  have taken the risk away from the market  especi at the long end  becaus market particip think we   re go to signal ahead of  e and they will have  e to get out of their long posit  in my view  we should go back to structur section   to say basic where we think the risk is   then i   d take the second part of that sentenc and put it down in section    becaus it   s still a tautolog to me   it still say we want to attain the right balanc   well  there   s no way ani of us      around this tabl is go to say that we   re not go to follow the mission of the fed   so if we   re  go to put in a tautolog  i   d put it in part     and in part   i   d just indic our assess of the  risk   that we think the risk are balanc or that the risk to growth or for inflat is greater   that   would give the market the messag that they need to go back to look at the data to figur out what   we   re go to do  rather than our lay out for them what our next polici move are go to be   as  we get to the cusp  that risk perspect is realli import   we saw when we turn from the bottom and rate were head back up again that it disrupt the market   but we need the market to be   readi to absorb that kind of risk becaus  as we sit around this tabl  we do not know exact how we   re go to engin get out of this pattern of move    basi point at each meet   and i think the way to do it is to focus on where we see the risk and to stop give ani kind of signal on  what our like move are go forward   i would like to see that happen at the next meet
thank you  mr  chairman   first of all  i support the   point increas   we have pass over fair quick  except for a coupl of instanc  the impact of remov the    accommod    languag  which i think is veri signific   and i am remind  base on past experi  that when we make multipl chang in our statement  there is a greater likelihood that the market will respond in way that we hadn   t intend   on the decis of whether to includ or exclud the word    measur    from the languag  initi i was ambival   but after hear the discuss  i want to make sure that if we remov it  we also had languag that took off the tabl the possibl of a    basi point move   so i was intrigu by     s suggest of   i don   t know what to call it   a gentl jettison of the term  and  i think on balanc i am in favor of keep it   so i am support both the   point move and altern b as written
mr  chairman  i support the propos to rais the fed fund rate    basi point   as to the languag itself  i support the first chang we had to altern b   sinc that  e  we   ve play around  if you will  with some of the word  and i worri a littl about wordsmanship  by    peopl over  e   i   m not sure how stabl that is   so  rather than be one of the     i   m veri happi with the languag as it stand  on the issu of    measur     i came into this committe meet somewhat reluct to retain that word in the statement   i was taken by your explan of the like market reaction and  on  further thought  i support retain that word as well   so i   m quit happi with where we are
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your proposit to tighten polici by    basi point today   and i agre with you that we   ll probabl have to move in januari  with a good  deal of uncertainti about where we   ll go after that   if i could design the market reaction to our announc   which i know from long experi i can   t   i would leav rate about unchang when we   re finish  with some probabl of tighten past januari  but not     percent   like you  i think we   re at a point where the momentum in demand and the level of resourc util are such  that if we   re go to make a mistak  we ought to err a bit on the side of go too far rather than stop too soon   exact what the role of asset price is in that is a much more difficult issu   i certain see  asset price play through to the macroeconom situat  as you said   in particular  hous price and the way they have s ul not onli residenti construct but consumpt more  general   and as i said in my remark  i think we need to see some sign that that market is cool off   so  in that regard  i agre that asset price are critic to the outlook   whether i would worri    about imbal and put a littl more emphasi on them  asid from the macro outlook  i think is a much more difficult question  in term of the languag  despit my expans read of the word    accommod    at the  last meet  i support it delet from the announc and the word of altern b   i don   t think we have to go to a restrict polici in this firm cycl  which i would defin as a polici  design to caus the economi to run below potenti in order to reduc inflat   i think i   ve just  been reinforc in that judgment by the recent data on cost and price   but we don   t need to get into linguist hair split to make our point about what we intend to do   i support take attent off of a precis definit of    neutral     which remain a shift and elus quarri   and that was inher  in the use of the word    accommod     in term of the word of the statement itself  i like altern b as it is current word   i  agre with you that move from    is like    to    may    would signal that we are about to stop  or that   we think the odd are at best       that we   ll move again  and we would have a heck of a ralli in financi market   and as i said  i   d prefer to leav market unchang at the end of this   so i would go with    is like    at this point  given my expect  and save move to    may    for the januari meet  if we think the odd are       for march   as for the word    measur     i would prefer to keep it in the statement   to me  it mean that we think we   ll be move in    basi point increment  and i do believ that   s our intent   i   d be concern that omit it would be interpret as an indic that the committe would be look at the possibl of move in    basi point increment  and i don   t think that   s what we intend to do  in the phrase    measur pace     i thought it was the word    pace    that tend to carri the concept of a seri of move  rather than the word    measur     which  to me  meant      so i   m in favor of drop    pace    and keep    measur      thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i support your recommend of a    basi point increas in our fed fund rate target   i can also accept the languag in altern b   like other  though  i came to the meet prefer to remov the word    measur      but i didn   t see remov the term    measur    in the way   did   that it meant market might think we would go up at a fa  pace of    basi point   i thought that it remov would give us more flexibl to stop at a certain point   it   s interest  in listen to this convers today  that we all have differ  interpret of what it would mean   so i am just go to go with your guidanc   nevertheless  given what i know today  i   m lean to the view that we   re go to have to stop at some point soon versus have concern that we   re go to have to do more   but again  given what i   ve heard today  and given your recommend  i support the languag as written in altern b
thank you  mr  chairman   i support a    basi point increas today and i  also support the languag in altern b   it seem to me that the framework in    b    maintain  it exist form and also offer forward look guidanc   i think we   ve had a veri construct process  much to my surpris  in the way    peopl have taken turn at draft a statement that has  evolv realli quit nice   the statement has the potenti to evolv further next month and in march  we   ve alreadi discuss way in which it can evolv   by elimin    some     chang    is like    to    may     or possibl exclud    measur     for today  i guess i   m comfort keep    measur      i think there are argument on both side of it   i think it is import to signal that we have no intent of do someth more  aggress than a    basi point move   on the downsid  as presid pianalto said  when you combin    measur    with    is like    and simultan remov    accommod     market may    conclud that we have in mind at least two more step  mayb more   and potenti remov    accommod    may signal that we intend to go beyond neutral into a restrict stanc   but it   s realli hard to interpret how the market are go to react to this   and frank  i think  this statement come as close as we can get to do what i would like to see today  which is to essenti valid the expect that are current in the market and in the  book   those  expect are that we are high like or almost certain to move anoth    basi point next  e and that what we will do in march and beyond is an open question   i think this is not a statement that is like to bring long term rate down  although we will see short   on the issu of asset price  i would simpli second the comment that governor kohn made about them   it   s a topic for greater discuss in the futur
mr  chairman  i too support the recommend for a    basi point increas   i   m sure that the process we went through on revis the languag in the statement was frustrat to the staff but i actual found it both interest and construct   when we   re make chang as  signific as we are today  i think there should be some way for all of us to contribut to the idea and to see each other   s idea   so again  as frustrat as i   m sure it was  i found it construct  there   s a lot to like about altern b  and i support it as well   i   ll limit my comment just  to the word in play   actual  my comment on the draft statement languag last week indic a support for leav    polici accommod    in   my think was   and i still believ this   that we realli haven   t move through whatev the neutral point is to pure tighten   i have a littl bit of   concern that market will interpret it that way and assum that we   ve gotten behind and  therefor  are ratchet thing up   but i like     s comment that there come a  e to honor discharg     word and phrase from servic   and sinc it   s so hard to measur  and even more difficult to talk about  i think it is  e to get that out of the statement   i actual think there   s no cost to leav in    measur    in row     although i think the probabl is veri small of it remov be misinterpret as an opportun for us to move fa   to me it   s much better to leav it in   i have a strong prefer for leav the next line as it is  with    is  like    instead of    may      i think that   s where we are  and i   d much prefer that the word stay that  way   i assum we   re go to have other substanti chang to the statement in come month   i just hope we can find a way either befor the meet or dure the meet to have a chanc to share our view and see each other   s idea  as messi as it is   i think we come out in a better place when we do that   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  i support your recommend to move    basi point and i support the languag in altern b   i think it   s a nice  balanc formul  and i do believ it   s the best way to leav expect rough neutral  i think we view the probabl as veri high that we   re go to need to move in januari and that march is mayb an even bet   that seem about right   this probabl introduc a littl bit more   uncertainti into the signal about monetari polici than has been the case befor  but i think that   s  desir   it   s a fair flexibl formul and allow us to adapt reason easili go forward   i agre that    may    would carri too much risk of take out a good deal of the tighten that is now built into the market  and  therefor  i don   t think it would be desir  the problem with    measur     of cours  is that in our discuss there is so much dispers on how we interpret the implic of    measur    today that it   s a littl hard to justifi retain it  nevertheless  i   m comfort retain it becaus it has two virtu that are not necessarili    inconsist   one is that it   keep a bit of a cap on expect about how much and how fast we need to move  and i think that   s probabl desir now   the second implic it carri is the sens that we may be face two more move rather than just one   again  i think that   s desir now  too  so  on balanc  it make sens to me to keep it   also  i just want to echo what mani of you have said in that i agre that this was a pretti good  process   committe some  have a bad name   we were a group of seventeen peopl this  e and i thought the process was quit good   i think the languag got better through the evolut of this statement  and that make me more hope   thank you
we are go to be vote onli on the direct and the assess of risk  therefor  we need a second view of the committe on the statement itself   it turn out that the critic word there that has been in disput  and which   was unabl to resolv   was the word    measur      and it had the advantag of not chang the rest of the statement either  way   whether it was in or it was out   in the event  a signific major seem to be in favor of leav    measur    in   henc  we will vote on the direct and the assess of risk  and if that get an affirm vote  we will presum that the languag for the statement shown under altern b is accept as well   so  whi don   t you read    b    and the assess of risk
i   ll be read the direct word from the bluebook and the assess   of risk from altern b in exhibit   from     s present      the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent      and the word for the assess of risk      the committe judg that some further measur polici firm is like to be need to keep the risk to the    attain of both sustain econom growth and price stabil rough in balanc   in ani event  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fo  these object
