i move approv
approv without object   we will now move to the special present on prospect extern adjust  and i call on    son
thank you  mr  chairman  you should have a packet of chart label    u s  extern adjust    in front of you   our topic today is u s  extern adjust   the    adjust    that is our focus start with the recognit that the unit state is run a larg and grow deficit vis  vis the rest of the world in the use of good and servic   a deficit that make obvious our interdepend with foreign econom behavior   as a result  some analyst are concern that a chang in foreign behavior at some point may have unwelcom consequ for us   but in today   s interdepend global economi  such vulner is present even for those in extern balanc or surplus   in our present today  we will analyz the factor behind our grow extern deficit and consid what circumst might fo  it revers   of particular concern will be the implic of various altern for u s  asset price  especi the foreign exchang valu of the dollar   one direct measur of our extern deficit  shown in the top panel  is the balanc of payment concept term the    current account balanc      that is  the sum of the trade balanc  net invest incom  and net foreign transfer   for mani year the u s  current account balanc has been driven for the most part by the trade balanc   both balanc began a period of substanti declin in      that was onli briefli interrupt by the recess in        the price adjust exchang valu of the dollar in term of the currenc of a larg number of our trade partner  the dot blue line  is central to our stori for two reason   first  the dollar exchang rate is an import price variabl in most  if not all  of the signific demand and suppli relationship in our complex stori   second  the dollar exchang rate is part of the transmiss mechan of u s  monetari polici and influenc u s  inflat determin   note that the dollar began to appreci from a low point in earli        in advanc of the downturn in the trade balanc   and general continu to rise until earli        the nomin exchang valu of the dollar in term of the major foreign currenc  the   line in the middl left panel  has come even further off it      peak than has the more inclus broad real dollar  near return to it      level   this differ reflect the fact that  in term of the currenc of our other import trade partner  the dash red line   the dollar has risen somewhat in nomin term sinc earli        the dollar exchang rate of the major currenc have tend to be more flexibl and more market driven than some of the oitp currenc  such as the chines renminbi  and the dollar has appreci against some of these other currenc  in particular the mexican peso   persist current account deficit cumul to the net intern invest posit  shown to the right  which measur our grow stock of indebted to the    the materi use by ms   son and mr  gagnon are append to this transcript  appendix      rest of the world   this larg and grow stock of claim on the unit state must be held at all  e  and one intuit perspect on the sustain of our extern posit is that this stock cannot increas relat to our gdp forev   everi import and export transact in the current account has a financi counterpart   except for measur error  the current account balanc equal the net of all the intern financi transact   there are  of cours  huge volum of cross border transact between asset   unrel to trade financ and driven by complex incent of risk and return   that have consequ for asset price  includ exchang rate   recent data for element of those financi flow  report in the bottom left panel  show that privat foreign inflow to purchas u s  secur  line    are veri larg  particular in relat to privat u s  outflow to purchas foreign secur  line    and net direct invest  line      moreov  these flow increas sharpli in the first quarter   nevertheless  foreign offici inflow  line     which had about doubl in       rose signific further earlier this year   from a macroeconom perspect and with the public and privat sector combin  the extent to which the unit state invest more than it save correspond to resourc borrow from abroad   the blue shade region label    net foreign lend    in the bottom right panel   this is the nipa analogu to the current account balanc   as the rise in u s  net domest invest in the     s outpac that in net save  our extern deficit rose   as our save subsequ declin sharpli  the extern deficit widen further   unless and until the trade balanc begin to narrow  adjust is not yet occur  inde  as was argu in the background paper circul to the committe  stabil in the ratio of our foreign indebted to nomin gdp requir that the trade deficit eventu return to near zero   u s  trade data are present at the top of your next exhibit   the yellow shade area repres the trade deficit  which has reach a record level   to the right of the vertic line  which is posit at the latest actual data point  we have shown a simpl extrapol of import and export   base on standard partial equilibrium trade equat   for the case in which real gdp here and abroad grow at potenti and the real valu of the dollar remain at it current level   with import alreadi substanti larger than export and with foreign potenti growth reason robust but slight less than u s  potenti growth  the chang in import tend to exceed that in export  and so in this case there is no adjust through        the   bar measur the chang in the trade balanc   for the trade balanc to narrow signific  export would need to grow rapid relat to import growth for an extend period   the middl panel provid a summari of the composit and magnitud of cross border financi flow for the same period  express as a percent of gdp   the trade balanc abov account for most of the chang in the current account balanc  shown in yellow   u s  privat financi outflow  in tan  also must be financ  and the sum of these two is the counterpart to foreign privat financi inflow  in blue  plus net offici flow  in red    the extrapol through      incorpor the trade outcom from the top panel and plausibl staff project of u s  and foreign privat financi flow   of cours  privat flow could behav differ  depend on the incent perceiv by   investor here and abroad   to the extent that the flow shown in blue do not fulli financ the current account deficit plus u s  privat outflow  foreign offici intervent may fill the remain gap  as shown here   otherwis  exchang rate  other price  and incom here and abroad would chang  result in a current account posit and privat flow that would satisfi the balanc of payment norm   the bottom two panel provid some detail on recent stock of dollar hold by foreign offici  the left panel  and foreign privat investor  the right panel  that correspond to the flow in the middl panel   es  base on data through april show that  of the total foreign offici hold of more than        billion  line     about two third consist of treasuri secur  line      the end of      was veri near the  e of the most recent peak in the valu of the dollar   chang from then through april are shown in the column to the right and reveal that the chang in the total is near account for by the chang in hold of    select    asia  line      economi whose monetari author have engag in substanti foreign exchang intervent  the incent behind dollar acquisit by foreign offici  for the most part  relat to their object for their respect exchang rate and the competit of their export   foreign privat hold are signific in fix incom secur   line       and   in the right panel   these investor are thus expos to dollar exchang rate risk and to u s  market interest rate risk   foreign hold of u s  equiti  line    are also larg but entail somewhat differ risk   over the period sinc the dollar began it appreci in       foreign investor have more than doubl their hold of each of these categori of asset   nevertheless  becaus u s  secur market are veri larg and quit liquid  chang in prefer on the part of foreign investor among these categori of asset need not have major implic for their price   howev  as long as the u s  current account remain in deficit  net foreign claim on u s  asset must continu to rise in total   ani diminut in the appetit of investor for u s  asset would first trigger valuat chang  primarili via the exchang rate  that would lower the foreign currenc denomin valu of their total claim on the unit state   such a chang in investor appetit could well be the first step in the extern adjust process   some characterist of an    order    adjust are list in the top left panel of your next exhibit   although there are a great mani possibl altern path for adjust that could be term    order     in the sens that financi market would continu to function within normal rang  such an outcom seem more like to occur if investor are attract by improv return abroad rather than discourag by unfavor chang in u s  prospect   various specif along these path would differ  but all would be character by continu  albeit declin  net financi inflow into the u s  economi   in addit  becaus last correct of the u s  extern deficit cannot be achiev through cyclic slow of u s  gdp growth to below potenti and the associ temporari restraint on import  extern adjust such that export increas more than import almost certain requir dollar depreci     the panel to the right express the data on foreign hold of u s  asset from the previous exhibit as share relat to the total outstand amount for each categori  foreign hold of u s  treasuri secur  line    amount to near    percent of the outstand stock  with the offici share about    percent and the privat share  not shown  about    percent   foreign hold are more than    percent of agenc secur   the percent held abroad is onli slight higher for equiti  with    percent of u s  equiti own by foreign investor  virtual all of whom are privat   these number are larg  and they have risen over  e   but moder financi inflow could continu over  e even if these share stabil or edg down   there appear to be ampl scope for continu financi inflow  as reflect in the bottom left panel   for most of the foreign countri shown  in decemb      domest secur made up most of their total bond and equiti hold  in mani case more than    percent   moreov  u s  secur are general just a moder portion of their nondomest hold   accord  it   not seem to be the case that foreign portfolio are alreadi over invest in u s  asset   if stronger demand for u s  export is to contribut to adjust  from which countri might it come   the panel on the right report that the economi with the largest averag share of u s  export in      were canada and we n europ  line   and    follow by mexico  line      these region account for a slight smaller share of the increas in u s  export over the past two year  shown in the second column  note the jump in the share for china and hong kong  line    when view from the perspect of the chang in export   this increas is somewhat offset by the drop in japan   s share  line      taken togeth  our asian trade partner  line          and    account for    percent of the gain in export   incom growth in asia is like to remain quit vigor  with domest demand a major sourc of strength   to a lesser degre  this outcom is like for canada and mexico   strong domest demand in those region will be necessari if u s  export are to acceler   the panel at the top left of your next exhibit is construct to illustr the sens in which there is a tradeoff between relat growth here and abroad and the minimum pace of real dollar depreci requir for the trade deficit to narrow   the line separ the shade and nonshad region was calcul use standard partial equilibrium trade equat  and it posit depend import on the current start condit  in particular the initi size of import and export   given those quantiti today  for ani foreign minus u s  growth gap  the horizont axi  the unshad area indic what the annual rate of dollar depreci  the vertic axi  would have to be over the near term for the u s  trade deficit to begin to adjust  follow the usual lag  in       we were well abov the line  with a growth gap of minus     percentag point and real dollar depreci of     percent   the panel show that the stronger relat foreign growth is  the less dollar depreci would be requir   howev  even for growth outcom veri favor to foreign activ  some dollar depreci would be need to get adjust start   the staff es  that the gap for relat potenti growth is current about minus    percent  so we have plot the correspond point on the line  mark by the box  as indic of how far to the right on the horizont   axi we might tend to be   at that growth gap  dollar depreci of more than   percent per year would be need to start the process of extern adjust   overal  the implic for the u s  economi of extend  gradual extern adjust   list to the right   includ that demand on the part of u s  resid and foreign shift in favor of u s  made good and servic  thus boost export and reduc import   in order for the unit state no longer to depend so much on foreign save  the extent to which u s  domest demand exceed u s  product potenti must declin   contractionari fiscal polici could contribut to restrain domest demand and increas net save   monetari polici would need to maintain full util of u s  resourc and may need to offset the expansionari implic of increas demand for u s  good   signific resourc shift across product sector may be need  which could entail adjust cost for the economi   we cannot rule out that adjust will be disord   in that case the primari concern are about condit in asset market  where there could be abrupt price chang  increas volatil  and impair liquid  trigger by chang sen ent on the part of foreign and domest investor about the attract of u s  asset  becaus of the role of the exchang rate in cross border transact  dollar depreci is like to be at the center of ani disord event   given that some depreci is part of virtual ani extern adjust  depreci in the case of a disord outcom would like have to be larg in magnitud and abrupt in pace   with global asset market now high link  ani abnorm develop in u s  market would be like to spill over to asset market elsewher   where are the effect of such asset price swing like to matter most   the bottom left panel contain data on balanc sheet risk face by u s  corpor via their debt denomin in foreign currenc   foreign currenc issuanc is just   percent of the total outstand  and a substanti portion of that foreign currenc risk may well have been hedg in the deriv market   so this channel is not like to have signific consequ   foreign hold of claim on the unit state are shown by region in the panel to the right   in european portfolio  especi those in the unit kingdom  and in canadian portfolio  hold of u s  asset are quit larg relat to their respect gdps   negat balanc sheet effect through declin in the exchang rate or u s  asset price could be expect to signific impair econom activ in those region and to be not inconsequenti for the other countri shown   joe gagnon will continu our present
your next exhibit consid the implic for both the u s  and foreign economi of an abrupt depreci of the dollar that could be associ with a disord adjust   as describ in the top left panel  we examin three scenario that build on each other use the staff   s frb global model   we note at the outset that these scenario are illustr of some of the issu that may aris and should not be view as forecast or even as particular like outcom     in scenario    there is an exogen perman drop in demand for dollar asset that would caus the broad real index of the dollar   s valu to declin    percent over the next two quarter in the absenc of ani respons in domest and foreign interest rate   the onli declin of this magnitud in the histori of the broad real index occur over a three year period from      to        in this and subsequ scenario  we assum that u s  and foreign polici interest rate follow a taylor rule   the dot black line in the panel to the right show that the dollar actual depreci less than the full    percent in this scenario  as higher u s  and lower foreign interest rate offset some of the depreci shock   column   of the middl panel show that u s  gdp  line    is about   percent higher after six quarter   the effect on the level of u s  output peak at just over   percent in earli      and then gradual unwind   higher output is more than account for by net export  line     as domest demand  line    declin   by the end of       core pce price  line    are     percent higher   this price increas is stretch out over ten quarter  so the annual inflat rate never rise more than a percentag point abov baselin   most of this rise reflect the direct pass through of higher import price  line     but a littl is attribut to the rise of output relat to potenti   on it own  this shock would not be consid disord  and it reflect a relat benign respons to such an abrupt dollar depreci   nevertheless  the negat effect on trade weight foreign gdp  the dot black line in the bottom left panel  is a bit larger than the posit effect on u s  gdp as polici rate in mani import u s  trade partner hit the zero bound on nomin interest rate   foreign real consumpt   not fall as much as foreign output becaus dollar depreci lower the cost of import to foreign consum   the opposit effect is at work in the unit state  show that even though dollar depreci is good for u s  product  it   have advers effect on u s  consum   in scenario    we posit that this abrupt dollar depreci is associ with a widespread loss of confid in u s  econom prospect that lead to a     basi point increas in the risk premium on equiti and long term bond in the unit state   the higher premium and lower expect profit caus u s  equiti price to fall about    percent   becaus of the import of the u s  economi and u s  financi market in the global economi  it is like that such a larg drop in u s  equiti price would spread to foreign market   the overal effect on foreign financi market would like be mute by safe haven flow to govern bond in major foreign countri   thus  we set the size of the foreign financi shock to have half as much effect on foreign output as the u s  financi shock has on u s  output   asset price declin add contractionari impuls to the simul  and now u s  gdp  shown in column   and   of the middl panel  declin on balanc   at the same  e  the upward pressur on u s  price  line    is reduc a bit  owe to slack in resourc util   as shown by the dash red line in the bottom left panel  asset price declin in foreign economi and spillov from the unit state have a substanti contractionari effect on our trade partner   polici rate in most of these countri drop to zero earli in the simul and remain there   scenario   consid the possibl that  when polici rate hit zero  foreign central bank might engag in quantit eas or other nontradit polici action to   s ul their economi   becaus the channel for such polici are not built into the model  we chose to relax the zero bound on polici interest rate and allow these rate to becom negat  still follow a taylor rule   as shown by the solid   line in the top right panel  easier monetari polici abroad lead to less dollar depreci  nevertheless  the level of u s  gdp  line    column   and   of the middl panel  is essenti ident to that in scenario     the reduc s ulus to u s  gdp from a smaller depreci is rough offset by the reduc drag from a smaller contract in foreign gdp  shown by the solid   line in the bottom left panel   the smaller depreci help to damp the rise in u s  price  line   of the middl panel    the bottom right panel display the classic j curv effect of a depreci on the trade balanc   most of the effect are complet by earli        the trade deficit narrow about     percent of gdp from the exchang rate shock alon and about   percent of gdp when other asset price also drop   these scenario engend a substanti degre of extern adjust  though not enough to elimin the trade deficit  which is current around   percent of gdp   all togeth  these simul clear indic that disord adjust of the u s  extern balanc is like to have a veri contractionari effect on foreign econom activ   a larg dollar depreci   which is like to be at the heart of ani disord adjust   provid a substanti s ulus to u s  export that offset much of the negat effect of ani financi distress on u s  activ   meanwhil  lower u s  import are a direct drag on foreign econom activ   in light of the dollar depreci that occur over the past two year  exhibit   explor whether extern adjust is alreadi under way   the last major period of extern adjust in the unit state occur dure the late     s   we find it instruct to compar the recent experi with that of the     s   the dash line in the top left panel display the rise and fall of the broad real dollar between      and        the solid red line display the broad real dollar in recent year  with the peak of februari      align with the earlier peak of februari        the amplitud of the cycl was greater dure the     s  but the broad contour look similar   the recent interrupt in the depreci is more pronounc than in ani compar period in           should the recent break in the dollar   s downward trend persist  it would be reason to expect ani adjust to be interrupt   the top right panel display the trade balanc over the earlier and later period   despit the smaller swing in the dollar in the current episod  the trade deficit as a percent of gdp has widen more than dure the     s   abstract from the effect of the      recess and      recoveri  there   appear to have been a flatten out of the trade deficit recent   in the     s  the trade deficit did not begin to narrow until more than two year after the dollar peak   we are just now approach the compar point in the current episod   the middl panel show that extern adjust in the late     s was associ with a sustain higher growth rate of real export  the dash blue line  relat to growth of real import  the solid   line    in the current episod  the growth rate of real import has exceed that of real export continu from      through late last year  but the gap has now close   adjust will requir a further rise in the export growth rate relat to that of import     the bottom left panel display weight foreign real gdp growth minus u s  gdp growth   as shown by the dash line  foreign economi grew fa  than the u s  economi in the late     s   robust foreign growth undoubt contribut to a relat smooth adjust process dure this period   in contrast  dure recent quarter  foreign economi on averag have grown more slowli than the unit state  the solid red line   and we are not project a revers of this relationship in the near futur   the bottom right panel give some indic that the willing of intern investor to fund our widen extern deficit may be diminish   net privat inflow of secur have fail to continu rise sinc the dollar   s peak in earli       foreign offici inflow have taken up the slack to financ the continu growth of the current account deficit   a similar rise in offici inflow occur at the begin of the adjust process in the     s   the top left panel of your final exhibit compar the recent behavior of import price with the previous episod of adjust   as shown by the red line  import price have turn up with the dollar depreci and the commod price increas of the past coupl of year   but the rate of increas is much smaller than that observ in the late     s   moreov  unless the dollar depreci signific further  we expect that import price inflat will drift down over the next year or so   the panel to the right show that there was not a substanti increas in core consum price inflat associ with the     s adjust   we do not expect a major increas in core pce inflat in the near futur   overal  the evid to date point to a paus in the widen of the trade deficit  but that is far from a signific adjust   inde  as   mention previous  if the dollar remain near it recent level we would project a renew widen of the trade deficit   in conclus  we believ that recent level of the u s  extern deficit are not sustain indefinit   howev  we know littl about the path that adjust will ul  follow  includ how long our larg trade deficit can be financ   the depreci of the dollar in      and      has help to slow the widen of the trade deficit  but there is no evid that a sustain or signific adjust has begun yet  assum that u s  and foreign output remain close to our es  of potenti  a substanti further dollar depreci is requir just to get adjust start   the relat order adjust of the late     s was associ with an acceler of foreign econom activ and brighter invest prospect abroad   on the other hand  a disord adjust process would more like be associ with a loss of confid in u s  econom polici and prospect   in a disord adjust  the contractionari effect on output could well be greater for foreign economi than for the u s  economi   while asset price declin tend to depress output both at home and abroad  dollar depreci tend to boost u s  product and damp foreign product  the effect on u s  inflat of even a larg depreci is like to be quit modest  linda goldberg will now continu our present
i will be refer to the separ packag of exhibit that you should also have in front of you   my portion of this brief on u s  extern adjust    the materi use by ms  goldberg are append to this transcript  appendix      focus on the exchang rate and trade exposur of u s  industri   some scenario for close the u s  trade deficit involv depreci of the dollar exchang rate against other currenc  yet such depreci do not affect all u s  produc similar   my background materi provid various industri level detail   in my remark today  i highlight four broad point   first  the most trade orient industri of the unit state are in the manufactur sector and account for almost half of manufactur employ  there are also some high trade orient raw materi industri   second  these trade orient industri are the one expect to be s ul most by dollar depreci   moreov  the currenc that the dollar depreci against is import  u s  industri experi greater s ulus when the dollar depreci against the euro or the yen  for exampl  than against the yuan   third  for mani industri  rate of exchang rate pass through into import price have been relat stabl over past decad   while there is evid of reduc import price respons to exchang rate in some commod  such declin in pass through may have been temporari  my fourth point is that a few high trade orient industri in the unit state may account for the bulk of the import and export adjust induc by dollar depreci   we begin by turn to the level of intern trade exposur of specif u s  industri   we discuss three form of trade exposur       produc export orient   the size of export as a share of produc shipment      the extent to which foreign produc have penetr u s  market  and     industri use of import input in the product process   the share of product cost attribut to import compon and machin   we defin high trade orient industri as have export orient abov    percent and import penetr abov    percent  these industri  shown in exhibit    are concentr in our manufactur sector and includ chemic  machineri exclud electr  comput and electron  electr equip  transport equip  miscellan manufactur  such as toy and jewelri  and leather product  which is a small industri in the unit state  taken togeth  these industri account for    percent of u s  manufactur job   outsid of manufactur  some raw materi sector are also heavili trade orient either in export or import  moreov  if we broaden our criteria to allow a more narrow focus on import penetr  we can also includ apparel  primari metal manufactur  and furnitur and fixtur   the dark blue bar in exhibit   show industri export share  and the red bar display import penetr of these high trade orient industri  both bar suggest produc revenu exposur to intern trade   the yellow bar show the role of import compon in industri cost   the use of import input mean that produc cost rise when the dollar depreci  as long as there is some pass through of exchang rate chang into the price of these import compon   to the extent that the same produc are expos to the same currenc on the revenu and cost side of their balanc sheet  produc profit are partial hedg against currenc fluctuat   all manufactur and nonmanufactur industri have revenu exposur in excess of their cost exposur to intern trade   this lead to the expect that a trade weight dollar depreci would be s ul  on averag  for u s  industri     exhibit   present the countri that are the destin for aggreg u s  export  as well as those that are the sourc of our aggreg import of good   canada and mexico togeth account for more than    percent of total u s  export and import  the euro area account for    percent   our trade imbal with china is suggest by the fact that that countri account for onli   percent of u s  export but    percent of our import   these share of countri in overal u s  trade transact are similar to those use by the feder reserv board in construct the aggreg exchang rate index for the unit state   howev  not all industri are expos to the same trade partner countri or  consequ  to the same bilater exchang rate movement  aggreg exchang rate index  therefor  will not reflect the chang valu of the dollar from the perspect of specif u s  industri   this point is made clear in exhibit    which show the share of the euro area  japan  and china in the export and import of each of the most trade orient u s  industri  as shown in the first column of the exhibit  the euro area is a key destin market for our export   the implic is that the euro   dollar exchang rate figur promin in the export competit of  for exampl  chemic product  transport equip  and miscellan manufactur product   in contrast  china is a relat small destin market for u s  manufactur good but is larger in some import categori   the yuan   dollar exchang rate is signific main to the extent that it chang the competit of u s  produc relat to chines produc of good be sold in the unit state and abroad   a polici relev issu here is whether a dollar depreci against the yuan would s ul u s  industri   a s ulus would most like occur in those industri where chines produc compet head to head with u s  produc   i address this point in exhibit    which present the amount of u s  manufactur employ in industri with differ degre of import penetr by china   the top row of exhibit   reveal that about    percent of u s  manufactur job are in industri where    made in china    good account for a low share  less than   percent  of overal good consum by u s  household   the bottom row show that high level of chines import penetr are strongest in those u s  industri that account for veri few u s  job  onli   percent of manufactur   there are few industri where    made in china    account for more than    percent of our consumpt of particular good   in the middl row of exhibit   are the industri with both import penetr by chines produc and sizabl u s  manufactur employ   industri such as furnitur  electron compon  photograph equip  and comput and peripher are those that can potenti experi a switch in demand from chines good to u s  good and are therefor the one most like to gain from a dollar depreci against the yuan   in evalu industri exposur to dollar real exchang rate move  let   s first consid the progress of the dollar against five currenc sinc        exhibit    on the next page  show that the dollar had strengthen against the yen  the euro  and the canadian dollar through earli       befor begin it descent   current  the dollar is close to it weakest level in four and a half year against the canadian dollar and the   euro  it has had a more limit descent against the yen   by contrast  the dollar strengthen overal against the peso and the yuan   we use these differ path of exchang rate togeth with the weight of our trade partner countri in each industri to deriv industri specif export weight or import weight exchang rate   exhibit   show the dollar depreci experienc by high trade orient u s  industri sinc februari       separ present from the perspect of u s  export and u s  import compet produc   the recent dollar depreci for high trade orient industri has rang from   percent to a littl over    percent for u s  export  as shown in the first data column of exhibit     the correspond depreci for u s  import compet produc has rang from about   percent to near    percent   a key point here is that  compar with other high trade orient industri  the industri that have china and korea and even japan as larg trade partner have experienc relat less depreci and smaller chang in competit condit sinc februari        as a final theme  in exhibit    i focus on exchang rate pass through into u s  import price   this theme is central to know whether exchang rate chang can induc enough demand switch out of import and export to make a dent in our trade balanc   pass through is also import for understand the potenti major distribut consequ induc by exchang rate within the unit state  exhibit   provid es  rate of the pass through of exchang rate chang into import price for differ bundl of import commod  the es  in the left column are for regress run use data span the late     s   earli     s through the second quarter of        the right hand column es  are for a more recent period  start in        the elast of import price with respect to exchang rate that are statist signific are in bold print   the first two row of exhibit   show exchang rate pass through into the price of an aggreg bundl of unit state import   the histor relationship indic that foreign produc general absorb a high share of exchang rate chang in their profit margin in the short run  about    percent  and about half of exchang rate chang over the longer run  one year    a rule of thumb is that a    percent dollar depreci rais u s  dollar import price by   percent   the stabil of this relationship between exchang rate movement and import price in the unit state is activ debat  especi with regard to whether exchang rate pass through has declin recent   the comparison between the full data sampl es  in the left column and the recent sampl es  in the right column is at the heart of this debat   exhibit   highlight three import point       the u s  dollar price of beverag  tobacco  and miner fuel import are relat insensit to chang in exchang rate  with food price onli margin sensit       exchang rate pass through rate into the import price of food  chemic product  and some manufactur good have been stabl over  e   a    percent dollar depreci

we es  lower pass through sinc the     s on the overal bundl of u s  import exclud fuel   overal  in my judgment  it is prematur to assum systemat and persist declin in exchang rate pass through into import price   the recent declin in pass through may have been temporari  import price observ from late      into earli      are back within the bound of the longer run histor relationship   we may see foreign produc reach a limit on the extent to which they let their profit margin absorb the advers exchang rate movement that have occur   therefor  more  e need to pass befor we conclud that exchang rate pass through into import price is lower than what is impli by the rule of thumb es    i conclud by combin these theme in a way that is direct relev to the extern adjust process for the aggreg economi   exhibit   show the substanti role that the high trade orient industri play in overal u s  trade   account for more than    percent of our total export and import   these are the industri on the rightmost side and bottom of each pie chart   the signific pass through of exchang rate chang into the import price of these industri provid the scope for expenditur switch between domest good and import   such expenditur switch within the unit state is particular feasibl in those industri where we continu to have a product and employ presenc   in my opinion  these industri are like to be the one that bear the brunt of trade adjust in the scenario for close u s  extern imbal   moreov  sinc industri countri are the domin market for our export  adjust to our intern trade balanc   and to u s  job   will be most pronounc for chang in the dollar exchang rate against the euro and the yen rather than  for exampl  the yuan   sinc chines import compet direct with a much smaller portion of our product  dollar depreci against the yuan would be less effect in the pursuit of a sizabl shrinkag of our trade imbal   continu gradual declin in the dollar against the euro and the yen would lead to fewer u s  import and more u s  export   chang in our trade balanc will appear to be driven by the export adjust   after cumul larg declin in the dollar  some u s  produc might expand their market orient to also focus on export instead of just u s  market  and this would then speed the overal adjust of the trade balanc   although import quantiti are chang in the background  too  the amount of total expenditur on import will look relat unchang   thank you for your attent and for the opportun to present these point
the last point that you made is particular apt in the sens that we have a general tendenc to evalu these type of major adjust in the context of histor relationship  and we don   t think in innov term larg becaus innov are veri difficult to anticip   let me just say that overal these present have provid an   extraordinarili incis view of the natur of the adjust process and a few of the potenti avenu through which an ul  solut can occur  in your pass through analysi  you made no refer to hedg characterist   we do know  for exampl  that in veri recent year the outstand volum of dollar   euro foreign exchang swap has gone up veri dramat   clear  to the extent that that is take place  the greater return on export is a combin function of hedg plus actual pass through   and even though we may see a veri sharp contract in implicit profit margin of export out of europ to the unit state  for exampl  or anywher  from the point of view of the export those loss may be fulli offset through the exchang market   and the export    behavior  sn   t chang until ul  as  e goe on they cannot avoid the depreci of exchang rate   so this is a process that slow the extent of adjust but cannot alter it   i understand the data are realli quit inadequ for ani industri analysi  but we do have aggreg data  and i was wonder if you have come to ani conclus as to what we can learn from that
let me start by mention the respons of profit to exchang rate chang   first  at the industri level  if we use an aggreg trade weight exchang rate to look for the effect of exchang rate on profit of u s  industri  we don   t see anyth that is statist signific   if we use industri specif weight  then we do get a signific relationship between exchang rate chang and the profit of u s  firm  there is anoth effect of the dollar depreci or appreci on u s  corpor profit that i didn   t mention   in addit to the hedg stori  which come through multin activ   and that is that  when the dollar move  there is pretti much a one to one translat effect that show up on the profit of multin activ   that mean  for exampl  that when the dollar depreci  the foreign currenc profit of these firm rise in valu relat to   their u s  dollar profit   and that show up as at least a temporari blip in the overal profit of these firm  i don   t have ani direct evid on hedg activ and the effect that has had on pass through and profit  but some of the implic of exchang rate for profit are reduc by the increas role of import compon use in product  which one can think of as anoth way that produc hedg foreign exchang rate
we do see that the good import into the unit state in dollar from we n europ show a far smaller inflat rate than would be impli by the one to one correspond foreign exchang rate   that impli either a signific declin in profit margin for european export or a veri substanti short in effect of the euro in relat to the dollar   i gather  as i mention befor  that this is a veri short term phenomenon  i presum you have decid that it impact  while it may show up for a year or two  is realli not a relev consider  larg becaus the foreign exchang currenc swap almost never go beyond a coupl of year
mr  chairman  may i
we have look  part at your suggest  into whether the lag might have chang  becaus i think the mechan you are talk about would like show up as a longer pass through lag   obvious we don   t have enough data to determin if this is a recent chang in the past coupl of year  we can   t tell   we look at whether the      s were differ from the      s and couldn   t find ani evid of a longer lag  e   the lag are pretti short
thank you   look at the broader question of the veri import impact in term of contractionari effect on foreign economi  are the calcul here made interact   in other word  are we get two static es   or are we get a dynam es    a feedback from the unit state to foreign economi and back
there would be dynam feedback   we use the frb global model  which will simultan captur both effect   from the unit state on foreign economi and from foreign economi on this countri   so  yes  it   s a properti of the model that thing that happen in the unit state have a bigger effect on the rest of the world than vice versa  in larg part becaus in this exhibit we weight the rest of the world by u s  trade weight to give greater weight to countri that trade with us a lot  such as canada and mexico and asian countri   if we had done the weight by market or ppp gdp  say  we would get a smaller effect
all of this say  at the end of the day  that the u s  current account deficit is rise as a percent of our gdp  or in a certain sens as a percent of world gdp  impli that we must be get compar increas surplus elsewher in the world   or put anoth way  this impli that the dispers of the world   s current account balanc is increas   that is almost arithmet necessari in the data that you have here   are we see ani sign of a slowdown in the global process   for exampl  in whatev  e frame we wish to look  what do we see in the ratio of aggreg world export to world gdp  aggreg extern gross asset and liabil as a percent of gdp  or ani of these broader macro relationship that relat to the dispers of current account balanc worldwid   in short  grant the long delay on a lot of these type of data  which almost all come out of the imf data system one way or anoth  is there ani evid that the rate of chang here is slow   what   has been happen in the last coupl of year  for exampl  to the data that are perhap the most current   world export as a percent of world gdp   how would you describ the quarter pattern over the last sever year
to be honest  i don   t have those number in front of me
could you get them
we could certain calcul world export to world gdp   my guess is that it won   t have slow
it slow down veri dramat a coupl of year ago
well  the recess
yes  but has it come all the way back
i can   t answer that exact   part of the problem  of cours  is find the unit in which to add up world export and world gdp  that requir us to use data sourc that are not avail on a  e basi   i don   t have world gdp for q   that number  sn   t exist
you don   t   what a shock    laughter
but what is true is that the global recess and recoveri tend to be more intens in good than in servic   they tend to be invest driven  at least in the unit state and to some extent elsewher   and trade is more good intens than is gdp  broad speak   so we saw import and export react more than in proport to our gdp or to our weight averag of foreign gdp  and presum the rest of the world  ad up  experienc the same phenomenon   i would assum that we are still on someth of an uptrend and are wash through a cyclic phase  but we can look at that and get back to you on it    of the variabl that relat to global in a somewhat more indirect way  the onli one that i know of that realli slow were the turnov measur on the foreign exchang market   i think  in part  the effect of the euro on foreign exchang turnov  as we measur it  probabl explain whi we saw declin in the volum of foreign exchang activ
but isn   t that also a function of the rate of chang in the exchang rate itself
there were at least three compon   one  there was an exchang rate effect   two  there was the euro   and there was a third factor that had to do with the increas autom in term of how the exchang market oper   electron broker  for exampl  becam veri  veri import
it gross up everyth
exact   the number were down about    percent from       to        but all of the signal that we are get now suggest that the survey just conclud in       will show anoth increas
but the gross  sn   t tell us what the consolid chang in global is   the trade balanc do  obvious  and the balanc sheet chang do becaus they are all direct relat algebra to the current account balanc and  henc  to the degre of dispers   there is a chart in exhibit   of     s materi  which has an extrapol of the current account balanc out to       when it goe to over   percent of u s  gdp   i   m look at that and i   m say  okay  whi not   there   s noth in this present that say    no  that can   t happen      it mere say that someday  somewher  somehow  that trend is go to chang   let me just ask a quick side question   how did you conclud in that   particular chart  the central one in exhibit    that foreign privat financi flow would not add up to the gross flow and that  therefor  the net offici flow had to fill in
that was just impos on the chart
there were some assumpt made about continu certain behavior and extrapol them and so forth  but i deliber didn   t want the red to have to go away  so i told the peopl who prepar the chart that it should have some red on it   laughter
so the red is there first  and privat financi inflow are the residu
well  these are hypothet   of all the piec of the stori  the composit of the capit flow that will financ the u s  current account is the most subject to chang and the least predict   so it would be foolhardi for us to claim in ani sens that we have written down a serious forecast   i simpli want to show how the element might interplay and what the piec would be
it   s actual veri help to see a base becaus you can alway make your own adjust   it   s the order of magnitud that i find realli veri use
similar  i didn   t want the tan portion to grow too much or to grow too littl either   it is import to realiz that not onli do we have to financ the u s  current account deficit but we have to take into account the realiti of u s  investor buy claim on the rest of the world   the element of global that are make foreign invest attract   that are allow peopl to diversifi  reduc home bias  and ad to this dispers to which you refer   appli to u s  investor everi bit as much as they appli to foreign investor   so that   s   an addit factor   and the flow must abid by simpl account condit   they have to add up   in order to make the process continu
could we have a hostil takeov of world statist discrep  which would help    laughter   the issu that is unknown here  as far as the dispers of the current account balanc is concern  is how far it can go   unless the circumst lead to unfinanc ratio of net claim against a countri relat to it gdp  there is no arithmet limit to how far that dispers could run   we are not see anyth in this present per se that suggest a limit
no  there   s just the ul  final condit that it can   t continu forev
that bring up herb stein   s famous quot as usual
yes  inde
it   s realli quit a use data system that you have set up to provid a sens of the order of magnitud   unfortun  i was distract when you were discuss exact what the definit were of the figur in the box in the bottom left hand corner of exhibit     this is a share of the portfolio of what
for each of these countri  it is the portfolio of their resid   in other word  line   refer to the portfolio of euro area resid     percent of which are held in domest euro area secur
okay  it   s the resid of these countri
yes   and they hold   percent of their portfolio in u s  secur  leav    percent held in non u s  foreign secur
i   m sorri to interrupt  but is that the same measur of foreign hold of u s  asset shown under the disord adjust scenario   is that the same thing
well  yes  in the sens that the figur in column   would be the same  but the denomin here is the portfolio per countri
and the denomin in the other is the countri   s own gdp
yes  their gdp
so even though the euro area has onli     percent of it portfolio in u s  secur  that figur is equival to    percent of it own gdp
yes  but let me amend my answer to you a second ago   in exhibit    the figur in the column label    u s  secur    is bond and equiti
and this other one is all inclus
this is all claim  includ foreign direct invest hold   claim in the unit state through that channel
so european own bank are part of it
yes  and chrysler and all the other invest asset that european have bought
i   m sorri  i apolog for interrupt
theoret  that figur could go well over     percent  in other word  you indic that this struck you as an indic that foreign are alreadi heavili invest in u s  asset  but a countri like belgium  say  could end up with gross net claim against other countri
in exhibit    my point is that if there is a disord adjust  the balanc sheet effect are like to be felt more by resid of other countri than they will be by resid of the unit state
i think that was well demonstr   i congratul you   it was an aw lot of work  and although there were no definit conclus here  i think you   ve set up a structur that give us a detail sens of what is involv in the fund of the intern financi system   question   governor
first  i tend to be in sympathi with the view express by   and joe that this grow extern deficit is probabl go to caus troubl at some point   it   s hard to know when   but if i understand what you did in exhibit    the disord adjust scenario  it strike me that you may have over prove the point   if one look at this  the real cost of the disord adjust is the declin in foreign gdp   and that  in turn  seem to come about   you have everybodi follow a taylor rule  but then the zero bound is a constraint   becaus countri can   t lower interest rate as much as they have to in order to stabil their economi   so the question is  what about fiscal polici   would it be possibl for fiscal adjust  either here or abroad  to stabil these foreign gdps
fiscal polici certain could help   the model are such that if you want to hit a target  you can rais or lower tax or rais spend enough to help to some extent  you might not like the other consequ   but the answer to your question is yes   while we did not actual run those type of simul  the logic of the model is such that fiscal polici could help in that regard
has there ever been in the intern arena ani evid that govern have respond to crise by appropri use of fiscal polici    laughter
and these govern  in particular  are alreadi challeng with respect to fiscal polici    laughter   but it is hard to see anywher on earth  with the possibl except of some asian countri  where the govern themselv perceiv the scope of use fiscal polici in that way  whether they could do it well or not
i am not here to prais fiscal polici   but suppos we have a disord adjust   i think it is interest  when you strip it all away  to ask  what is the problem with that   if the problem is realli that polici either won   t adjust appropri in the case of fiscal polici or can   t adjust in the case of monetari polici  then that   s fine   that   s interest to know   i think that is what you are say
we take that point veri serious   and it may be one reason   mayb some of you have notic it  too   that  when we go to intern meet  it is alway the other peopl around the tabl who are complain about the u s  deficit and worri that it is go to caus a problem   that may be becaus  in fact  the problem from the point of view of the unit state seem quit manag relat to the pictur we get of tri to figur out how this situat is go to work itself out in the rest of the world
governor    may i add that i agre with the outcom of the scenario  but there is also a lot of redistribut across industri go on in the background here   there   s a shift from capit good sector toward export orient sector and the one that were compet with import   i don   t know to what extent the cost associ with those type of transit are built in  but that could be an extra drag  at least for a while  that work itself through the economi
as long as i have the floor  could i ask linda a question as well
of cours   i don   t know if you   re go to get an answer   laughter
well  i   m sure i   ll get an answer   actual  i   m not sure i have total grasp all this   in look at your exhibit    suppos the dollar chang a lot   there are three ramif on industri that you   ve highlight   one is that the cost go up  and that   s bad  that   s illustr by the yellow bar   the import share is high  but it could come down if the dollar goe down  right   and the black bar  the export share  could go up   so you have three thing go on for each of these industri  and unless i miss it  i don   t see where you have put it all togeth   have you done a simul with a given percent chang in the dollar and look at the cost structur  the import competit  the export competit  and so forth  to see how these industri come out in total equilibrium
what i   ve done is a bit more limit in that i   ve look histor at the effect of exchang rate movement on profit and the net effect in term of the first two bar  which are the revenu exposur versus their cost exposur   and i   ve found that those effect are a veri signific issu for them  as is initi this point about the translat effect on multin profit  the other thing i   ve look at  where there is industri level detail  is the sensit of export and import to exchang rate chang   those are the two piec   what we see in that exercis is that  when the dollar depreci  the export of these type of industri respond signific  so revenu get a realli big boost   on the import side  though  for these industri it   s a differ stori   if you look at the overal u s  economi and at how much we are spend  say  on import of transport good from abroad  you find that the sensit of that to exchang rate is pretti much zero   and the reason is that we end up have higher price on   import car  for exampl  and import fewer car  so the balanc of those effect won   t show up in our import balanc   so import sensit  the amount we spend on import  is a differ stori from the one convey by the product volum in these industri sinc the u s  produc will still be expand their own activ
incident  the input   output cost data you have are now for       to
were these number in exhibit   for a specif year
yes  these number are  i believ  for
you   ve es  the cost use the      input   output data  which is close enough or should be
just a quick follow up on exhibit   and the disord adjust scenario   you indic that for the unit state you have a taylor rule kind of reaction for polici   in the most benign case  scenario number    what kind of adjust do we need domest and   to the extent you can character the intern adjust   intern to respond to this scenario
in scenario    we have the feder fund rate follow a taylor rule  the fund rate increas    basi point in the first half and gradual move up about     basi point   i don   t have a weight foreign adjust  but i can tell you that  in the case of our major trade partner  they hit the zero bound in that scenario
even in scenario number
yes  but just bare   in scenario   they are quit strong constrain  in scenario   they just bare hit the zero bound constraint   i could tell you how much they would have to lower rate if there were no zero bound   japanes rate would be down     basi point  and euro rate would be down     basi point
if they didn   t hit the zero bound  your scenario   line wouldn   t go much below zero  would it
no  becaus they just bare hit the zero bound   so  it   s true that if you   re look at the effect on their gdp   is that what you   re look at
in that case  in the bottom left panel  the dot black line goe down to minus     percent rather than minus     percent
in some sens  if monetari polici could work immedi and without friction  none of the gdp line would move in this scenario
just a follow up   the order and disord adjust scenario are base on where we are today  if i understand correct
yes   and in some sens  the eleph in the room is the size of the current trade balanc
you   re say that this can continu  though you don   t know for how long  and as it
the eleph grow
the consequ grow   and yet there is noth we can do about it  which is an interest conclus
in some sens  there   s noth we need to do about it   on the other hand  i do lose a littl sleep over that conclus   but i do believ that global capit market are better at decid where the world   s capit ought to be put than almost ani other mechan i can think of
but we know that at  e it give us a terribl headach
it can   and it   s certain true that factor like u s  fiscal polici bear on the intertempor consequ of allow this deficit to run   it bear on a much broader issu of intertempor resourc util in this countri that includ our borrow from abroad and our repay or servic of those borrow go forward   so  i am inclin to say when i look at exhibit     i agre with the chairman   that it could happen   it is perfect plausibl that there will be no adjust through        but then i look at the diagram on the top left in exhibit    and everi year that goe by that the deficit get bigger  that line shift   so what it would take to get us go in the other direct becom a bigger and bigger hurdl over which we have to jump   the interplay of those thing and whether the world   s econom resourc are be best alloc by all the million of decis that are be made by peopl everywher is the conundrum in all of this   it is not an immedi issu   it is not go to produc a crisi tomorrow   it might not ever produc a crisi   but embed in this situat are these issu that are a concern
we have a long list of peopl who wish to speak  but i think we can break for coffe at this stage   let   s get back in ten minut  plus or minus thirti three second   coffe break
thank you   i   d like to take us back to a point that linda made in pass becaus it   s one that worri me a bit   there is the sens not just that an adjust between the consumpt of foreign produc good and the consumpt of domest good is involv but also that there would be a switch in the natur of good  with a move toward fewer invest good and perhap more final consumpt good   as you   ve look at this   particular you      have you thought veri much about what the implic would be for the u s  economi befor we get to the disord type of situat   in an even less benign case than describ in the list of implic in exhibit     i suspect one of them would be less invest and potenti slower product growth here over the long term   linda  mayb you could start by pick up on the point you were make just in pass to governor   about invest good versus consumpt good   how might that adjust play into it  and more broad  what are the implic of that
well  if the dollar depreci is part of the larger switch of investor sen ent  for exampl  out of asset hold in the unit state  we   d have higher interest rate and lower invest spend   in term of the overal gdp effect  that is offset to a larg degre in the simul by the expans of product in export orient and import compet sector   i don   t think the scenario get into how cost the period of disloc is   involv the transfer of worker between industri or type of job or perhap a temporari period of capit realloc   i think that is the context
linda is refer primarili  at least in the last portion of her answer to you  to what we might call adjust cost   the mix of u s  gdp that would come out of this depend entir on just where the shock start  how it make it way through the economi  and in particular  how monetari polici has to respond   in the event that the shock began becaus   asset prefer turn against dollar asset  we would get one sequenc of event   we would get s ulus   the unit state in ani scenario has to produc more tradabl good and fewer nontrad good   so  in some sens  the shift has to involv a move into manufactur and certain sector that we all know and love  and against certain sector that we may think we probabl are overindulg ourselv in anyway    laughter
we   ve got a bud politician here    laughter
that mix shift  sn   t necessarili have to mean that it is somehow an unwelcom develop in the u s  economi and that we   re go to have a smaller manufactur sector   we may have a bigger manufactur sector   we may have more invest in certain sector  but we   ll have less invest in other sector  look at the same set of relationship   and use the vocabulari of the nation incom account   we do have to shrink our save   invest imbal   we have to lower total invest and rais total save so that they meet  or at least come closer to meet than they do now   the lower dollar will be a term of trade chang to the unit state   u s  consum will have less purchas power over the world   s good  broad defin  than befor the dollar fall  that will be a forc against consumpt  and it favor invest   the realli critic thing would be that monetari polici  even in some order scenario i could imagin  would have to tighten to restrain excess aggreg demand that would otherwis emerg in the unit state owe to the expansionari shock of dollar depreci  but if adjust were to begin by fiscal tighten in the unit state   if that were among the first thing to happen   or by a spontan increas in u s  save rate owe to demograph effect or some such develop that brought down interest rate and exchang rate and lower domest demand  monetari polici might even have to eas   in that world the   mix of invest and consumpt and govern spend that we   d ul  get would be differ   so  that   s not predetermin   the mix could come out a varieti of way   but the save and invest imbal has to close   that much we know for sure
i would just add  though  that in the case of this asset prefer shock that   note  we are go to have higher real interest rate  which will crowd out a certain amount of interest sensit spend   some of that will fall on hous invest and some on consum durabl  but some of it will fall on busi fix invest as well
a lot of this adjust take the differenti in product growth rate in the unit state versus foreign economi as exogen   and what those differenti are realli has a great deal to do with the adjust process
yes   inde  in the background paper we report anoth model simul  which we did not describ today  that make the shock the product stori   it involv a one  e product shock that work it way through the whole global economi  and you can see how that world look differ from the one in which asset prefer chang
but i think to some degre the conclus from all of this      your point that exhibit   suggest that it   s more the rest of the world   s problem than our   is not quit right   there   s obvious a reason for all of us to be worri about the outcom from even an order adjust   as you indic  depend on the way the adjust start  we as a societi might be relat unhappi with the outcom or relat happi with the outcom   so let   s be cautious about say it   s no wonder that repres from other countri ask us at various meet we attend what we   re go to about our extern deficit   it   s someth we have to be ask ourselv as well
yes  right   but a stark case of that point is the differ between product opportun emerg abroad that attract capit abroad  as oppos to just a widen of the risk premium becaus peopl becom dishearten by the cours of polici or the polit or the outlook for the unit state for some reason   the whole mix of save and invest global and the accumul of capit depend on just these kind of factor
first  let me compliment everybodi who made a present today and those who wrote the paper becaus i think they did an extraordinarili good job   for those of us who don   t live in this arena all the  e   of make a lot of complex thing quit interest and quit compel   i want to ask a coupl of question  and then i just want to make a comment  my first question relat to what seem to me a differ between the two paper regard the impact of a depreci of the dollar on overal price chang  as measur by the pce as the board staff     it look to me as though linda   s present suggest an impact that may be a third bigger   so i wonder if i got the number right there or not  and i may not have  the second question was a reaction to     s statement about whi peopl from other countri are concern about this   it may be  in term of portfolio analysi  that it is not a veri big alloc to have in the euro area   let   s say      percent of the portfolio in the unit state  i know that a broader definit of hold of u s  asset was use for that calcul than for the ratio of u s  asset hold to a countri   s own gdp   but i was struck by those latter figur  if you assum that someth of a disord natur happen relat to the u s  currenc and the u s  economi in term of an adjust on the trade side and    percent of a countri   s gdp is   somehow involv  i can see where that could caus them to be concern   peopl in other countri know that adjust on our side will need to be bigger as  e goe by  and the impact on them could get bigger as well   so  it is not surpris to me that they are everi bit as concern about this as they think we ought to be   it worri me that we are not that concern  final  i thought your first chart in the extern adjust materi was veri interest  the chart on the bottom right hand side on u s  save and invest show that over  e we had a great deal of net domest invest and then we had the bust in      with the stock market correct and so forth   and we had a substanti amount of net foreign lend  you made the point that  if net save had continu at the level that it was in       say  the current account deficit wouldn   t be anywher near as big now as it is   that  of cours  correspond pretti much in  e with the swing of the fiscal deficit from someth like plus     percent of gdp to minus   percent or so of gdp   we recent host a confer where everybodi was quot herb stein all the  e becaus of the fiscal deficit and trade deficit   everi speaker start off with a quot from herb stein   one of the speaker   actual it was ted truman   made the point that the twin deficit aren   t twin but they share a lot of dna  with the dna be relat to the nation save rate  it seem to me that we don   t have a lot of option in term of correct someth that   though it is get bigger and it consequ are in some sens more dire all the  e   ul  has to come to an end   in my view  one of the way that policymak would have the most control over the outcom would be to do someth about the fiscal deficit   it was rather interest to me that you seem to tipto around the fiscal deficit in your paper   you talk about how that could be a correct mechan  but there was no prescript discuss in the   paper   that may be becaus we don   t control fiscal polici  i suppos that   s possibl whi   but that seem to me someth that may deserv a littl more attent
let me answer your question in revers order  if you don   t mind  there is a differ in some of the conclus we draw about pass through  and i think it would be worth air that a littl  you might ask  what if we just extend that save line  wouldn   t everyth have been wonder   but the point of that panel on save and invest and relat it to the other inform on the same exhibit is to tri to emphas the general equilibrium natur of this process   it is true that fiscal polici could help   fiscal polici is the one textbook answer to do someth in the right direct to resolv this problem   but let   s say that govern expenditur were cut for whatev reason   just hypothet  in a thought process   to match whatev might otherwis have happen and we kept the save rate suffici so that the line for save would have been horizont   a lot of the cut of govern spend would have been on domest produc good  not intern produc good   there is no magic direct channel from fiscal polici to trade good or to our trade deficit  we do simul ask what the outcom for extern adjust would be if we assum a fiscal polici action of this or that size   if we put a contractionari fiscal polici in place that lower domest demand for an unchang exchang rate and everyth els  momentarili we have slack resourc in the u s  economi   the model then tell us that monetari polici should respond and should s ul the economi to get util of resourc back to capac   but the mix of gdp will now be differ   by construct  we cut g  govern spend   the question is  are we go to get more export   are we go to get more of some other compon of domest demand   and the answer to that question depend   import on the interest elast of the compon of domest demand  the interest elast in our model of the exchang rate  and the exchang rate elast of export   so as we do this exercis  fill that hole from fiscal polici  we get back a fair substanti amount of domest demand   and the adjust that we get in the extern balanc is onli a portion   and it could even be a small portion   of the chang that was made to fiscal spend that start it
so basic we would need three thing to happen domest and one intern   on the intern side  foreign economi have to grow fa   domest  we have to have more save  hope not too much less invest  and the fiscal deficit has to go down a littl
right   i think we   re confus endogen and exogen thing here  which make me a littl nervous   but somewher along the way there need to be a mechan that    crowd in     to use     s languag  export and help to get extern balanc out of the fiscal action   the same stori would have been true had the origin shock just been a spontan increas in save rate on the part of the privat sector   what deliv the extern adjust is that the exchang rate chang  and it chang the relat price among the compon of gdp   the result is that peopl  both produc and consum  shift their behavior in a way that make net export fill that hole as oppos to other compon of domest demand   the interest elast compon also come in to fill that hole
and in the staff model  it would be about       of trade adjust for everi       of fiscal contract
you did have a    percent figur in there   but    percent is better than noth
i will take thirti second on this question about whether these number in exhibit   are big or littl  and then we will turn to the pass through question   it is true that the    percent of gdp for europ or the    percent of gdp for canada that are shown in that exhibit are big number   but rememb  on this basi  capit output ratio for economi are number like       so  though these economi hold claim on asset that are multipl of their gdp   and their claim on the unit state may be    percent of their gdp   you want to put it in that perspect
oh  okay
we   ll turn to the pass through question   linda
we do have a disagr on what we think the pass through is  i   m guess that  in the end  there won   t be as much disagr about that go forward as it might appear   let me go through what the differ is   when i talk about pass through of exchang rate  i   m refer to the pass through of exchang rate movement into import price  and i   m give as a rule of thumb a pass through of one half   in the board   s simul model  i think it   s about a third  or    percent
it   s about    percent in the board   s simul model   so we have a differ sensit of import price to exchang rate chang  and that has a number of effect in term of what you see here in our materi   look at exhibit   in     s and joe   s materi  the disord adjust scenario  if the pass through of exchang rate movement into import price were higher  there would be more import price respons and more core pce respons   we   d probabl have as well a larger relat price adjust between import and domest good  and we would see more of a net export respons  more expenditur switch   go on in the model   that   s how that chang would manifest itself in that scenario  a higher pass through would give you more inflat and more of a net export respons  so then the question is  whi do we have a disagr   part of it reflect how we es  this  and part of it reflect how we view the current data relat to histori   is the recent histori most relev   is the longer histori most relev   what i see is that the pass through did declin  it seem to be lower over the     s   but recent price observ  while on the low side  are still within histor bound   so which is it   do we have a perman lower relationship  or are we on the low side of someth that histor has been high and low   i tend to go with the longer histori in part becaus  after we   ve had a strong dollar period  foreign produc have been abl to be quit profit and build up their margin   that also give them scope for accept lower margin for a while  but that   s a finit process  one interpret is that  in      or earli       foreign produc were live off the fat of a strong dollar period  and mayb that   s not a long run relationship to be lock in   also if you think of the asian countri  china   s price haven   t been chang against the dollar becaus their currenc is peg to the dollar  so china   s competitor might have been more constrain in move their price   whether or not that is someth that can persist is debat
i think we agre on what we   ve seen in the past and  of cours  we both are wonder what will happen in the futur   i   d just like to say that i believ a lot of the differ in our view come from how we think about commod   that   s an issu to consid go forward   we both look at import price  disaggreg and aggreg   when we look at aggreg import price  we tend to put commod price separ in our regress in addit to exchang rate   we  too  find that there was less pass through in the       s   the question is  what is the stori late   i think that   s where we may have some differ  in the past few month we   ve been say that more of the rise in price has occur becaus commod price are rise  which we think has some exchang rate compon but also has a larg cyclic compon   domest demand in china or  more broad  a world demand compon   to our mind  that may explain whi the pass through seem to be higher late    e will tell which will turn out to be right   frank  i have a lot of sympathi with perhap a return to a higher pass through in the futur becaus i think  as linda said  the lower pass through in the      s might have been becaus it was a  e when china   s econom growth was rise and their currenc was peg to the dollar   even though a lot of countri in asia had exchang rate movement up and down in the      s  for those who compet with and integr their product process with the chines  there was an     pound gorilla that they couldn   t realli compet against   so they were forc to price along with china  and china   s currenc was tie to the dollar and thus our pass through es  would fall   when we   ve look bilater at which countri seem to have pass through less in the     s  it was japan  develop asia  and mexico   so it   s quit possibl that  if china were to revalu or think of a chang in that respect  all bet could be off   mayb we   d go back to the histor pass through   the juri is out on that
mr  chairman  my question was ask alreadi  so i   m go to pass
thank you   joe  in model the current account deficit  you have to explain where it came from   a big part of your stori is that u s  asset and foreign asset are   imperfect substitut  and there was a big exogen increas in the foreign demand for u s  asset   i understand whi you did that  but that   s a veri import assumpt   the elast of substitut between our asset and foreign asset is go to affect mani aspect of the model  for exampl  if it   s inelast  a chang in the demand for u s  asset on the part of  say  foreign central bank would have a larg effect on the valu of the dollar   so i guess my question is  do you accept that implic   what would be the effect of assum a much more elast relationship in demand between differ asset   how central is this to your basic stori
you are refer to the background paper that we circul
in that we had a somewhat differ model simul a rise and fall in the current account balanc   i   m not sure that we are here to hang our hat on one explan for the rise and fall of the current account  clear a number of thing were go on then   i wouldn   t say that the portfolio prefer shock is entir the stori   but one reason that i chose to highlight it  to some extent  was that  if you look at a number of variabl in the u s  economi at the  e   interest rate  output  inflat  the exchang rate  the trade balanc  and so forth   it   s the one shock that sort of move thing joint togeth well   that  sn   t mean that some other combin of shock might not also have work out that way   but it is one that   work out that way   so in that regard it has some nice featur   anoth obvious shock that we highlight was the product shock  and the reason we didn   t use that alon is that it just  sn   t do enough   you   d need a much bigger product shock in our model for ani reason calibr to explain the trade balanc
i was also point out that this assumpt has import implic for the way the model work   for exampl  relat small chang of demand in   the portfolio can have larg effect on relat asset price   how sensit are your simul to that assumpt
that   s a veri good question   i don   t sens that it is that import   a movement in foreign exchang intervent of  say       billion or so in the model is not go to swamp the exchang rate  if that   s what you   re say   is the portfolio balanc built to do that   no  i don   t think it would do that   i actual can   t point to specif evid  though  so mayb we should look into that   but my sens is no   that the simul are not sensit to that assumpt   becaus these are veri larg number   even intervent of larg amount by the standard we are use to is not go to be larg enough to make a differ   we   re talk about a trillion dollar   but your point is a good one   as a model convent  it realli help in term of actual solv these model   it   s quit normal in these kind of model to put in someth like this becaus the model can be stabl and you get to a steadi state you can understand   so it   s not unusu to do that  but it   s a good point
come back to the point that sever have made about the frustrat with the absenc of a respons to the extern imbal issu  there has been talk about a fiscal polici respons and even a monetari respons in the instanc of a disord threat   my question   and i ask this of joe at the break   is what the effect would be if the unit state signal a chang away from a strong dollar polici   that is a postur chang  assum we are not actual interven   what would be the impact of the secretari of the treasuri say   la   connal     we   ve thought this through again  and actual a    percent drop in the valu of the dollar would seem to be appropri at this  e
the one stumbl block in tri to analyz this problem that we   ve encount sinc we began   we have a littl cottag industri here  and i have been do this for eight or nine year of my life now   is that we don   t have the capac to relat exchang rate  in real  e or hypothet in a model  to a number of variabl and have a determinist relationship among those variabl and exchang rate that work veri well at all   so we are alway forc to pose the problem and structur the answer in way that don   t requir that we claim that we can forecast exchang rate develop   we talk about relationship  but we don   t say that the dollar will do this at a certain point in  e or even that the dollar will do this in respons to the current account  which is an open issu that we didn   t even rais here   we have lot in here about how the dollar affect the deficit implicit   in joe   s simul  the dollar is drive these thing   we don   t realli have anyth about how the deficit is feed back on the dollar becaus be abl to explain determin of exchang rate is the weakest link in intern econom go   we don   t have an answer  and other don   t have one either   i   m inclin to think that  if secretari snow rent out yanke stadium and made the announc you indic  the dollar would move   but i wouldn   t be base that on an understand of econom    laughter   it would be more my understand of the polit in the unit state and what i think trader would do becaus that   s what they think other trader would do
well  let me come at it from the other direct   what is the impact of stay pretti close to the posit general espous by the secretari of the treasuri   except for o   neill who was somewhat more flexibl on it   of be support of a strong dollar posit   the current secretari has maintain that posit  at least as i understand it  of be support of a strong dollar
part of me cling to the hope that oral intervent of whatev sort has a margin and onli transitori effect on exchang rate and that deep down the econom fundament drive the process  regardless of what anybodi say
so that ought to work the other way also  on the downsid
i have a question for   and joe      do you want to hazard a view on whether the probabl of a benign adjust exceed that of a malign disord adjust
ask her to predict the exchang rate
we   re just not in the busi of predict crise here   down deep the thing that make the u s  economi differ from the rest of the world i think are overpow in term of the role of the dollar  notabl the size of the economi  the flexibl of the market  and the depth and size of the asset market   the notion that the world   s investor will truli becom so dishearten about the u s  economi that they will produc someth that would look like a disord adjust strike me as remot   on the other hand  i was an adult in the     s and earli     s  and i rememb period when the dollar was thought to be a veri weak currenc   and i rememb period when feder reserv polici weren   t well regard   so i   m not about to say that could never happen   i just don   t see it happen ani  e soon
so in a sens  you think we control the risk
if u s  macroeconom polici remain well ground  if the valu of good in term of u s  dollar is well maintain by this committe  if natur  sn   t impos some truli exogen crazi event on the u s  economi  and if u s  fiscal polici could get a littl   better  i think those are the thing that will determin how this situat evolv   but  you know  when i read my own brief i realiz what it mean   that this problem is go to continu to grow   and i rememb herb stein   s admonit and say that this situat can   t go on  at some point  in some way  an adjust has to occur   the paper had a rather benign outcom in which the product differenti just work it way through the system and thing more or less correct   i can certain imagin  if the same sort of product shock that hit the unit state were to becom evid abroad   which we keep look for   that it would acceler that process even more   and those stori do exist   those adjust path are veri credibl
i want to come back to scenario   in your exhibit    in which you have the dollar fall    percent in a year   certain an outright cliff of that magnitud in a year
it   s in two quarter actual
in two quarter   and you assum that come with no increas in risk premium on other u s  financi asset   i   m ask how realist is that
no  no   you should think of scenario   as just an initi descript of an element that is in the whole set of scenario   we didn   t realli mean for you to take scenario   serious without scenario   come along as well   that was more an analyt clarif  we think that much dollar depreci would roil market
in that short a  e period
yes  in that short a  e period   as indic in exhibit    start in      a depreci of that magnitud occur over     year
and in      we sat here and had a convers   one in which i actual particip  sort of in linda   s role   and tri to ferret out what the consequ were   go to be of the dollar depreci that was in train and how much disloc there would be  we were all concern about whether there would be enough domest capac to meet the shift in demand that was go to take place toward tradabl good and away from other good   we wrung our hand a fair amount about that   but in retrospect  it   s clear that there   s a lot of flexibl in the u s  economi   and given that the shock took place over     year  there was in a sens plenti of opportun  therefor  for the privat economi to respond more smooth to it  so there was less risk associ with the rise risk premium in financi market   that process occur more smooth  i think  than we thought was like to be the case ahead of  e
in my own mind   joe actual did this page  so he might have a differ way of explain it   i don   t think of the shock in scenario   as caus the shock of scenario     if peopl were to wake up and decid that they didn   t want to hold claim in the unit state  that would mean that all those thing would occur at onc   peopl simultan do not want to hold dollar claim but also do not want u s  equiti or u s  bond  et cetera
so you   ve drawn no particular polici implic in term of thing we could do to mitig the risk of an advers outcom beyond what we would do anyway  such as tri to keep monetari polici credibl  inflat expect low  and rediscov fiscal virtu   anoth question is    it matter at all what happen to exchang rate polici in greater asia
i see that as affect the path   in other word  those countri are in some sens financ our deficit   offici financ is a variant of privat financ  it has differ incent behind it and perhap work through other asset market a bit differ   but what the asian offici sector is now do is in part financ a continu of the deficit as oppos to trigger or even particip in the adjust process   there are some risk embed in   that   there are some who feel that the decisionmak in the offici sector is a bit more polit  it is not compar to the kind of decis and thought process made by those in the privat sector   also  the sum are get veri larg so that the hold of foreign claim on the unit state are becom concentr in a veri few spot   huge sum are held in the central bank of taiwan and the peopl   s bank of china  that in and of itself sort of chang thing a bit   on the other hand  i   m inclin to think that those offici entiti are not like to shoot themselv in the foot if they can help it   so there are pluse and minus  i guess   if they chang their exchang rate strategi  i would expect them to chang their reserv manag strategi  i think those two thing will go hand in hand   while it will matter to the specif of the path  i don   t think it   s a deal breaker
may i just add one point   i fulli agre  but in addit to the exchang rate polici in greater asia  there   s the question of whether demand manag there can ul  help push toward the benign outcom   if we get increas open and thus greater consumpt of u s  good   so that basic those market becom more of an export destin for us than they have been   that can help facilit the export expans that would produc a more satisfactori outcom   that said  asia is still a pretti small share of overal world spend and that effect isn   t go to be tremend  but it could help on the margin
actual  i was go to ask about this last point  the asian dollar block  let me just ask one variant on that   the european some  complain that the asian dollar block forc more adjust through them   but i would say that that is not necessarili the case  it could mean that the asian  by absorb these claim  are stop the total adjust from happen   it   s not necessarili true that they
that is certain the attitud that the staff has taken   we   ve even written those point down  and we   ve ask the chairman to say them out loud  and he has   laughter
and nobodi knock me down
you   re just follow order  i know    laughter
in part  it goe back to this unansw question of exchang rate determin   in essenc  that conclus follow from a kind of portfolio balanc theori of the exchang rate   what it say is that  when the chines  for exampl  take dollar off the market and out of the hand of the privat sector  they make dollar less abund relat to chines renminbi   that is true  but they also make dollar less abund relat to european currenc  so in essenc  they absorb some of the dollar that would otherwis be put pressur on the euro and ani other currenc you care to name  that   s becaus there is this big portfolio balanc issu and relat suppli are a factor  so anybodi who buy dollar in some sens is help the other currenc  not hurt them   but that isn   t the onli theori of exchang rate determin that one might want to adher to   and given that none of these theori is empir veri satisfactori  it is possibl to construct the stori anoth way and get a differ conclus
while i have the floor  let me make one comment on fiscal polici and the exchang rate correct   the fiscal rectitud point   i   ve told the same stori that we   re tell here  but i also rememb the live discuss that chairman  span start in jackson hole about ten year ago  when he said that he thought narrow the feder deficit would strengthen the dollar   i think the channel he was think of was confid   so if we had a circumst where the fiscal situat look explos and we start narrow the deficit  it   s veri hard to   tell what the effect on the dollar would be   the model say one thing  but who know in real life
there are  e vari and polici vari risk premium on most of those equat  and we can get differ outcom
i have two question   the first one is for joe and   becaus i was think about financi market as they appli to the analysi that you did  especi in the first paper that was distribut to us on june      when i look around the world  the unit state has realli been veri innov compar with other countri in term of the type of privat secur trade in our market in part becaus of the depth and liquid of our market   we have been innov in securit durat and credit risk   and in everi other way that one can cut and slice risk   and in creat deriv  too   my question is whether in your analysi of the privat secur flow you see someth of a suppli side impact on those flow   if someon is sit in anoth countri do good portfolio analysi  and the depth  liquid  and varieti of risk exposur they can acquir in u s  secur is more attract than the altern  is that in and of itself a tradabl good that attract them to the u s  market
i would say it   s not   the fact of the matter is that most of the secur of at least privat corpor   not u s  treasuri  obvious   that foreign buy are market in europ and are sold in the euro market   they are not sold in new york   i   m not say that there aren   t ani sale of the type you ask about  but there   s a huge offshor market for corpor in which the secur are denomin in various currenc and the lender can vari   and that market is for the most part in london   in tokyo  too  and to a limit extent in frankfurt   not new york   what foreign buyer of u s  corpor purchas is a secur issu   in their own jurisdict and in some sens govern by their own jurisdict   s practic   so  while i see your point and i   m sure that some part of what you are say is accur  it   s not as if these peopl truli are particip direct in the u s  corpor market   the u s  corpor are go oversea to the euro market  what is true is that foreign corpor haven   t follow those in the unit state in choos to offer corpor tradabl secur that have a rang of altern   the secondari market haven   t develop  and the deriv market haven   t develop as much  in part becaus of the univers bank tradit that they have   they   ve gone a differ way   it   s true that they might chang   those corpor could becom more multin so that their tast for how to financ themselv in differ place chang   if european corpor start to offer a richer mix of high qualiti corpor debt in their own market  european or asian or other non u s  investor will see more competit with u s  bond and equiti  and that could have an effect
my other question is for linda and goe back again to exhibit   and is about the pass through   one of the chang that intern corpor have made involv replac trade by go into custom market   actual put in facil and manufactur in the resid countri where the ul  sale occur   when i look at the data in exhibit    the industri where the pass through has come down the most is transport  which i guess is compos primarili of auto and small truck   clear  we   ve seen german and japanes auto manufactur move into the unit state more of their product of vehicl destin for this countri   by put more of their product in the resid countri    that in effect reduc their inher exposur to foreign exchang risk   is the amount that is still be   import into this countri small enough that they don   t need to push it through as they might have done twenti year ago  when all of their u s sale were be import
i think that   s certain a possibl   when i think about what the import price respons to an exchang rate chang is go to be  i think of the produc who is do the export look at his own cost and his margin over those cost   base on that and the markup in the industri and so forth  he then determin how much he has to chang price  so that part  sn   t chang even if the compani has facil in the unit state or has diversifi the locat of it product   there   s anoth part to your question about whether product diversif across market is in part induc by exchang rate volatil  and peopl realli differ in their view of the import of that   i tend to think that diversif occur in part becaus firm want to offset some of the risk by have the abil to move oper between market   so i agre with that  but i don   t know how big that is relat to the total amount of invest and the total amount of trade that goe on
first  let me add to cathi   s commend for joe and linda and the excel background paper   my question relat to     s in a way   it has to do with the locus of disorderli   the prospect for disord adjust seem to motiv and anim a lot of this analysi   and it strike me that a lot of the risk regard the rest of the world   some of our trade partner have been known to resist the appreci that accompani the type of intern adjust that we   re look at here   in particular  some develop countri often resort to macroeconom commit like exchang rate peg that they have onli a limit abil to follow through on in a consist way   these commit are not perfect substitut for the credibl that come with deep and resili market and a credibl   commit to low inflat   it strike me that those kind of commit by these countri enhanc the prospect of their be suscept to domest macroeconom instabl in respons to chang in u s  macroeconom condit and the type of adjust that we   re look at here   i wonder if you   ve given ani thought to that or what your general reaction to that notion are
well  a certain variat of that theme is to rerun the asian crisi in one   s head over and over and ask  what if this or that or the other thing had been differ  inde  mani peopl now argu that some of the asian countri are recreat condit compar to those that exist in      and       in particular the stabil that they are tri to achiev in their exchang rate   are those kind of condit be recreat   i think there is a clear risk  now  it is also true that one of the lesson that those countri drew from the asian crisi is that larg hold of reserv are a good insur polici   also  they realiz that run a current account surplus remov the need to go to the market to financ their activ in ani given month  day  or quarter  if condit get a littl advers   i think they are quit explicit seek to build larg quantiti of reserv both to impart confid to the market  which see that they have all these wonder reserv  and to use if need   though i would say it   s probabl more the former than the latter   and they exhibit a certain bias in the direct of keep their exchang rate from appreci in real term becaus that   s what generat the surplus that protect them from the need to go to the market   so they don   t have a larg outstand stock of debt  and  if anyth  they are run down their net debt posit and might have posit claim on the rest of the world at the rate they are go   they don   t have a   flow problem  and thus they feel better posit to manag the up and down of be global into the world   s capit market  the problem they face involv the consequ for their domest economi if these strategi ul  get uncomfort   one thing that could happen through the back door is that they may end up with their money suppli grow and they may have domest inflat  so they get real exchang rate appreci even while they are maintain nomin exchang rate stabil  they may at the same  e lessen the chanc to strengthen and develop their bank system and their capit market becaus they are constrain price in the domest financi system more than is attract   so they may be encourag their privat citizen to diversifi out of the domest market  even though they are tri to reassur those privat citizen through the exchang rate stabil   these countri might be better serv in the long run not just to hold on to the resourc they are requir as reserv but to use them to come up with a stronger bank system and more competit capit market   ul  that strategi of tri to achiev exchang rate stabil is not go to prove to be a long run winner   it could be a good adjust strategi  buy  e to accomplish the domest reform and to strengthen their financi system   do that care over a period of  e   but it   have the capac to put us back in a world in which the emerg market countri  even success one  lack some of the featur that the develop countri have  particular on the invest side   so these emerg market countri are still subject to concern about sudden revers of capit flow or capit flight from their own resid  and those sort of thing   indonesia  for exampl  has had a lot of pressur on it exchang rate late   shade of a return to        it   s a real issu   and i think it   s one of the reason that we can financ a   percent deficit when they   probabl can   t and that we can probabl financ a   or   percent deficit when they sure couldn   t     it mean that we can financ a   or    or    percent deficit   i don   t know
i know it   s about  e to end this discuss  but i have one more question     it matter what happen to the project foreign share of the u s  treasuri market under a scenario where our extern imbal is substanti larger   mayb get larger than the increas in the net borrow requir of the govern   is there a point at which you would worri about the implic of these line go on indefinit  with a grow foreign share of the outstand stock of u s  risk free asset
within the kind of number we   ve experienc to date we   re inclin to be relat relax about that   dino might want to comment on that issu  too  though
sn   t it depend on the interact between u s  treasuri secur and privat secur in total
you assum that the prefer would chang
yes   in other word  if there is liter zero prefer differ  then the    percent foreign hold of u s  treasuri is the wrong ratio   the denomin has to be the aggreg   and it   s probabl closer to that than not  so that number fall from    veri signific
you assum that their prefer would chang as their share increas
i think what we   re talk about are the prefer of everybodi els  let   s assum that foreign offici  becaus of law written into their book  their regul  their procedur  or whatev  alway want u s  sovereign but that the vast major of global   investor regard u s  sovereign and u s  corpor tripl as as perfect substitut   then this tini group call foreign offici can do whatev they want  and it realli  sn   t matter to the price of the asset involv
and if the yield spread are relat stabl  then the substitut  for all practic purpos  is without limit
now as a taxpay  mr  chairman  it would probabl be churlish to complain that the foreign are buy our debt at high price
i agre   it would be churlish    laughter
i think there are consequ for market liquid within the treasuri market becaus some of these foreign purchas do act differ in the primari and secondari market than privat holder   in particular  there are differ in term of particip direct in the auction and not put in competit bid and in the secondari market not put the secur out to lend
aren   t these second order effect general
this remind me of the debat we had when we thought u s  debt was go to disappear   while that has consequ  it was not someth we regard as a bad thing becaus we had surplus   so  sure it is manag
we start a whole new discuss    laughter   anyway  the clock has run out on us  and i just want to congratul    joe  and linda   it has been a veri interest seminar  which is realli what this has been  and i hope it engag us   one littl thing that went by unnot as you were talk about    natur   s    effect or an exogen event  is osama bin ladin part of natur
i say that becaus there is a veri interest phenomenon here  in term of what happen to all of this adjust process in the event of a signific terrorist attack within the border of the unit state   that   s a whole differ scenario  which we realli haven   t address in ani materi way  except to presum that  if we can manag a high degre of flexibl in our market  it will somehow get absorb   but how it will be absorb  i   m not sure we know  in ani event  as you are all awar  we have our annual recept at the u k  embassi this even   cocktail are at       and usual we sit down for dinner about a half hour later  transport has been made avail for board member alreadi   for the presid stay at the waterg  vehicl will be avail at your hotel at
mr  chairman  i was wonder if there would be enough  e for dino to give his report from the desk   that way we can start tomorrow with the chart show
i   m sorri   i didn   t realiz that we did have some  e   i think that   s an excel suggest   dino  whi don   t you get start and see if you can finish
thank you  mr  chairman   i   ll be refer to the chart that   circul a short  e ago   i   ll tri to proceed quick   dure the intermeet period the market   s focus was on the anticip start of the tighten cycl   as shown in the top panel on page    three month deposit rate  the black line  increas near    basi point and forward rate three  six  and nine month forward  the dash red line  rose more than    basi point   the nine month forward rate now is abov   percent  treasuri yield move higher   the middl panel graph the two year yield sinc januari      along with the target fed fund rate   two year yield have near doubl sinc late march to about      percent  and their spread to the fund rate is at it highest sinc the spring of        much of the focus in market has been on recent inflat report  and the short end of the curv has respond   the long end has not risen as much   the coupon curv  repres by the spread between two year and ten year treasuri yield  has flatten to below     basi point  as shown in the bottom panel  one thing that market particip have point out is that  if expect were for sharpli higher inflat  one would expect to see that curv steepen  but it has not      the materi use by mr  kos are append to this transcript  appendix      anoth way to look at inflationari expect is through the tip market  though here the usual health warn about interpret of tip yield and breakeven appli  as shown in the top panel on page    breakeven yield have tend to rise in recent month as the econom data have improv  oil price have stay elev  and the cpi index has risen   a noteworthi featur of recent trend is the converg of breakeven rate between shorter date tip and the longer ten year tip   one possibl interpret is that inflationari expect in the near term have risen   while that could be a contribut factor  there are technic factor that may be have a disproportion effect on these relationship   tip are tie to the not season adjust headlin cpi rate  which   creat some interest dynam in the price of the tip themselv   the recent rise of oil price has increas investor demand for tip becaus of the anticip addit inflat accrual on tip princip   this may not reflect expect for broader inflat to take hold   a second technic reason is relat to the calcul of the inflat accret  shorter date tip outperform longer date one dure a period when the cpi index is rise   this will reduc the real yield and  in turn  widen the breakeven   third  the tip market is begin to matur   pension and invest consult have discov tip and are increas view them as a separ invest class   the movement of fund into tip from that sourc may be exagger the price movement and lower real yield for the  e be   we don   t know how much money has been alloc to this asset class   but we can look at what is happen with regard to the dealer   in the earli year of the market  the dealer tend to be long tip   one has to assum this was voluntari on their part and that they found the yield attract   this is depict in the middl panel   in recent month inventori have been near zero  or net short tip  presum as the real return has becom less attract to this group of inform agent   with such technic factor make interpret of tip difficult  anoth place to look at is in one year forward inflat rate deriv from cpi swap   cpi swap are an exchang of fix for float payment base on the consum price index   as shown in the bottom panel  the forward inflat curv has shift upward   in a larg parallel fashion   by about    basi point sinc earli april  which is support of the notion that there has not been a disproportion shift in the level of concern about near term inflat perform   look at fix incom market more broad  there has been a lot of comment about the degre to which posit have been adjust in advanc of the expect tighten   or put differ  the issu is  how much of the carri trade has been close out   unfortun the data to answer this question are not avail  and the inform that is avail is ambigu   the top panel on page   graph primari dealer posit data sinc may       dealer typic are long credit product that are in turn hedg by be short treasuri   and typic dealer  as a group  are somewhat net long   in the past few month  dealer have extend their short treasuri posit  the dark line   and their   overal posit are close to flat   this is suggest of one key constitu take step to reduc risk ahead of an anticip tighten   anoth perspect is provid by posit data made avail by the cftc  which are shown in the middl panel  while these data have their own definit problem  they suggest that noncommerci user were go short treasuri futur  presum either to hedg other posit or to extend specul short posit   this is also consist with an unwind of leverag   other bit of evid are not as definit   banker suggest that hedg fund are still abl to secur veri favor trade term   and while individu hedg fund are less leverag than they were sever year ago  there are more of them around and it   s not at all clear that their strategi are so differ   notwithstand assur from some about the heterogen of those strategi   in addit  sector of the fix incom market where the carri trade was said to be crowd have shown onli a modest widen of spread   as shown in the bottom left panel  the invest grade corpor and mbs spread are somewhat wider  but the price action   not suggest larg scale liquid to date  and anecdot report suggest that bank and hedg fund are still hold on to larg posit in mortgag back secur   the bottom right panel graph the embi  and high yield spread   interest  spread   after widen around the  e of the last fomc meet and after some negat news out of brazil   have narrow to below     basi point for high yield instrument and to below     basi point for the embi   there are certain some fundament explan for the recent narrow   improv corpor outlook  lower oil price in recent week  and some improv emerg market news   but none of these develop in and of themselv suggest that the leverag trade have necessarili been liquid   price action in foreign exchang market has had trader scratch their head   the top panel on page   show the dollar   s movement sinc april   against a few major currenc   but this  e not includ the new zealand dollar    laughter   despit the sharp movement of interest rate sinc earli april and the shift in expect  the dollar has bare move  and sinc the last fomc meet it has tend to fall   foreign exchang trader have taken that as a bearish sign  which suggest to them that the dollar will fall onc the tighten cycl actual begin   sever have note that the dollar fell from about      to      against the dm dure the      tighten cycl   japanes market have perform well  equiti price have outperform as the outlook for japan has brighten   the yen has been under modest upward pressur again  and some in the market are specul that the ministri of financ will return to intervent fair soon if the yen continu to face upward pressur   the middl left panel show the recent rise in the ten year jgb yield   the rise in yield has been general across the curv   as can be seen in the middl right panel  which depict the japanes yield curv as of ye day and as of rough a year ago  the entir yield curv is sharpli higher and steeper   while the author have been talk yield down the past few day  mani in the market are begin to think about the bank of japan   s transit back to a more normal oper structur   in europ  the data have tend to be mix and somewhat disappoint given growth in other region   reflect this diverg of perform    yield there have risen onli slight and not as much as compar u s  yield   as shown in the bottom panel   turn to page    i   d like to spend a few minut updat the committe on the reduc volatil in the fed fund market that we have observ in recent year   the type of rate volatil i will be describ is veri short term   intraday standard deviat of the fund rate around the daili effect rate and the deviat of the daili effect rate from the fund target   the top panel on page   graph the annual averag standard deviat of the fund rate around the effect rate in blue and give the annual median in red   in general  the standard deviat of the fund rate measur by the annual averag was in a rang of between    and    basi point until       and it was somewhat less than that use the median   the spike in the earli     s were link to a varieti of factor  such as financi problem in the bank system that creat tier and the elimin of reserv requir on nontransact and eurodollar deposit  the declin in volatil began in earnest in      and has been maintain in subsequ year   with some notabl except such as septemb           and the day after  the bottom panel take the same data and present them in a differ way  it depict the median of roll ten day period of daili standard deviat of the fed fund rate  this graph show the regular spike associ with the year end  which have now all but disappear  as well as the somewhat higher volatil in the fall of        page   take a differ perspect by look at the absolut deviat  express in basi point  from the fed fund target   this measur suggest that most trade is increas veri near the target  with veri littl deviat   the precis reason for this notabl declin in volatil are not clear and my colleagu at the new york fed are do some research on this question   no singl explan by itself is compel  but some combin of the follow probabl would get us most of the way there   first  among technic factor  was the shift to lag reserv requir in      that help make reserv demand more predict both for the bank and the desk   second  the desk expand the number of bank from which it collect daili reserv posit data   also to help it better es  reserv demand   third  bank have develop better intern control and inform system for manag their reserv posit   and fourth  at the margin  the desk is probabl interven more often now than it did in the late      s or earli      s  given the explicit rate target regim   though this   not explain the continu declin in volatil sinc        but the lurch downward in observ volatil is hard to explain with technic factor alon   two other factor that probabl play a role are the lower absolut valu of interest rate and the introduct of the primari credit facil   lower rate direct limit the absolut amount by which rate could declin  so with the target at   percent  the scope of deviat on the downsid is onli     basi point at present   indirect  low rate have lift reserv requir  by boost growth in transact deposit  and have creat more room for bank to increas their clear balanc requir consist with their use of price servic   and possibl the experi with much lower volatil has affect market expect to the point that the trend has becom self reinforc     the impact of the primari credit facil is hard to assess at present   it has limit the extent of upward spike in rate on individu day  as shown on page     but sinc we saw few occas when rate reach close to     basi point abov the target in the year or so preced the creation of the new facil  it   s too earli to conclud that the facil   s creation has been a major factor in explain the reduc level of volatil   at some point the impact of lower rate  includ the impact on reserv requir  will be revers   when this happen there will be some increas in rate volatil   but mani of the other factor mention persist  so even if volatil increas  there are reason to expect that it will not rise again to the level we saw in the     s   two wild card that could affect this pictur includ the possibl that the congress will permit the fed to pay interest on reserv and  second  the way in which the new daylight overdraft rule for gse payment of princip and interest are implement   either of these has the potenti to have a major impact on fed fund volatil trend in the futur   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in this period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper
i haven   t look at the primari dealer data system in recent year  but the net outright posit  as you point out  have essenti come down to zero from a signific plus   what are the miss item in the balanc sheet that account for the differ
i   m not sure i fulli understand your question
well  on the asset side  the primari dealer have posit  long and short   there is a net posit with a valu   what is on the liabil side for capit
what we tri to do is to look at the posit data to see what the long and the short are  exclud certain thing such as tip  bill  and discount note   that basic give us a sens of what secur are there   now  there will be a big repo book on both side of the balanc sheet  so those have been subtract as well   so this is one way of give a pictur of the posit
the tradabl posit
yes  without clutter it up with a match book  which would tend to balloon the balanc sheet   that would tell us someth about the financ  how this on net is be financ   but the match book oper is it own busi
and you don   t have the deriv posit net in this at all
that   s right
one other thing   on the chart show japanes three month to thirti year govern yield  are these the absolut valu and the actual yield  these are not the yield of the one year matur ten year out
no  these would be the actual yield
they are the actual yield   that lead me to conclud in look at the ten year  twenti year and thirti year yield that the more implicit one year matur ten year out is yield veri signific abov these number   what is that yield  do you know offhand
i don   t
in our case  we   ve got     plus percent  and this  sn   t look all that differ
this goe to thirti year
i know  but look at the ten year   it   s the rate of chang in the yield curv
there   s a risk premium in that as well as an expect
i would hope so    laughter   question for dino   you traumat everybodi    speaker      i move approv of the domest transact
without object they are approv   we will adjourn until tomorrow morn   is anyon not come tonight to the dinner   good  i   m glad everyon will be attend   so we   ll see you all at the british embassi at        meet recess       morn session
good morn everyon   mr  olin  would you start us off
thank you  mr  chairman   we have receiv a lot of inform about econom activ sinc the april fomc meet   focus first on the data in hand when we close the  book  the top left panel show that labor demand has clear strengthen   privat payrol increas at an averag pace of         per month in april and may  build on the improv in the first quarter   these gain were broad base and includ an upturn in the manufactur sector that accompani a surg in factori output   as shown to the right  manufactur ip rose at an averag annual rate of near   percent in april and may  up from the alreadi brisk   percent pace in the previous two quarter   despit the rapid rise in good output  inventori   sale ratio  the middl left panel  have move sharpli lower outsid the auto sector  and we anticip that stockbuild will gradual pick up  ad support to product in come month   in addit  hous activ has been stronger than we anticip   as shown to the right  start of singl famili home remain elev in may  and sale of new home shot up to a record high   howev  the key data releas after we finish the  book have been softer than we expect   after fold in the new data on consum spend  we now project that real pce  shown in the bottom left panel  rose at a     percent rate this quarter  down from the     percent pace in the  book   no doubt  some of the recent weak in spend reflect the hit to real incom from the larger than expect rise in consum price of late   after the  book close  we also receiv new data on order and shipment of nondefens capit good   as shown to the right  both seri dip in may  indic slight less robust demand for busi equip than we had anticip   take this new inform on board  the tabl in your next exhibit show that we current es  real gdp  line    to have increas at a    percent rate this quarter     percentag point below the  book forecast   combin with the downward revis to first quarter gdp in bea   s latest es   growth in the first half of the year now appear to have been less vigor than we had thought  and we have mark down the second half forecast a bit as well   nonetheless  the basic contour of our project is littl chang from the  book   we continu to project that gdp growth will move up in the second half of the year   on the strength of fa  increas in consum spend and some inventori restock   befor drop back to about     percent next year as monetari polici becom less accommod and fiscal polici turn slight contractionari   with real gdp increas a littl fa  than potenti over the forecast period  we project that the unemploy rate  line    will drift down to about    percent by the end of          will discuss our outlook for inflat in a few minut   at this point i would simpli note that the price data releas sinc the  book contain some further    the materi use by messr  olin     and sheet are append to this transcript  appendix      upward surpris  and we now project that the core pce price index  line    will rise   percent this year and     percent next year    in light of the less favor news on inflat that we receiv sinc your last meet  we have incorpor a greater degre of polici tighten in the current forecast   as shown in the middl left panel  we assum that the feder fund rate reach   percent by the fourth quarter of next year  compar with    percent in the april  book  this chang result in a slight higher assum path for long term interest rate   the thrust of fiscal polici  shown to the right  is essenti the same as in april   among the other key background factor  the bottom left panel show that we have shift up our assum path for crude oil price by rough    per barrel  in line with the revis in futur price   move to the right  equiti price were a tad weaker than we had expect over the intermeet period  prompt a small downward adjust in the path go forward   taken togeth  these revis to interest rate  oil price  and stock price shave a few tenth from our project of gdp growth for        your next exhibit review the current state of asset valuat  begin with the equiti market   the top left panel plot the forward earn   price ratio for the s p      the red line  and the real yield on long term treasuri  the black line    the gap between the two seri reflect the combin effect of the equiti risk premium and the market   s outlook for earn growth   this gap has chang littl over the past few year  hold at a level around the averag in the first half of the     s   by this metric  stock appear to be reason price   we believ the same is true for corpor bond  the shade area in the panel to the right show our es  of the risk premium in the high yield bond market  which we calcul as the differ between the observ high yield spread over treasuri  the red line  and the part of that spread

we anticip onli small increas in commerci real estat price over the forecast period   the top left panel of your next exhibit show the implic of this analysi for household wealth posit   as you can see  we project that the ratio of net worth to incom will edg off a bit over the forecast period  as the subdu rise in real estat price hold down the gain in net worth   howev  this anticip downdrift

panel  we expect real dpi to rise at a pace of more than   percent over the forecast period  reflect a combin of sizabl employ gain and increas in real compens per hour   our project for real spend growth  the red bar  is slight below that for real incom  as we expect the save rate to move up toward it longer run target level over the forecast period   in the hous market  higher mortgag rate are expect to damp activ  caus residenti invest  shown in the middl left panel  to post a small declin next year   some comment have express concern that a firm of monetari polici will dramat rais interest payment burden for household   we believ that such concern are overblown  in larg part becaus most household debt carri a fix interest rate  which slow the adjust of interest cost to rise short term rate   the middl right panel illustr this point for mortgag debt   the black line show the thirti year fix mortgag rate  while the red line display the averag rate on the outstand stock of fix rate mortgag   as shown  the polici tighten from mid      to mid      boost the thirti year mortgag rate more than     basi point  but the averag rate on the stock of debt bare budg   we expect a similar pattern to hold over the forecast period   to be sure  interest rate on adjust rate mortgag will move up  but even for these loan  the averag rate will rise gradual becaus mani arm start off

payment  all scale by dispos incom   as shown  this ratio has come down from it peak  larg   reflect the wave of mortgag refinanc that reduc the averag interest rate on mortgag debt   go forward  we expect the ratio to remain about steadi  as the slow rise in the averag interest rate on outstand debt is offset by some further substitut of mortgag for higher cost type of debt   our relat upbeat view about household financi condit seem to be share by market particip   one indic  shown in the bottom right panel  is the interest rate spread on secur back by credit card receiv  this spread has

default rate on corpor bond  the black line  has drop even more sharpli   some analyst believ that busi   like household   will suffer signific financi pain from a rise in short term interest rate   the middl left panel present a key part of the argument against that view   the black line show an es  of the interest rate that corpor face on new debt  calcul as a weight averag of bond yield and bank loan rate   this rate jump dure the tighten episod that began in      and      and has plummet in recent year   howev  the averag interest rate that firm pay on their stock of debt  the red line  has been far more stabl  in particular  this averag rate increas onli about    percentag point dure each of the two tighten cycl   more recent  the averag interest rate has held steadi despit the drop in the cost of new debt   this unusu pattern larg reflect the fact that the latest downsw in borrow cost was driven by shrink credit spread on corpor bond rather than by declin short term rate   the reduc spread had no direct effect on interest cost for the larg volum of fix rate debt sit on firm    balanc sheet   the financi health of the busi sector ul  depend on it capac to generat profit   as shown to the right  the profit share of gnp now stand at it highest level in more than three decad   although we expect earn to soften somewhat over our forecast period  the profit share should remain quit high by histor standard  thus  firm have the wherewith to support solid increas in capit outlay  and the caution that had been hold down spend now appear to have fade  as illustr in the bottom left panel   this panel plot the well known relationship between the acceler in busi output and the growth in real outlay for equip and softwar   the line drawn through the dot show the fit relationship for the period from      through        as indic by the red dot below the line  e s spend was except weak dure      and remain soft in      and        howev  the strong gain record so far this year suggest that      will end up abov the fit line  and we expect the same to be true in        the tabl to the right summar our forecast for total busi fix invest   as shown  we project that total bfi  line      will expand    percent in real term this year and anoth   percent next year   this contour reflect the pattern for spend on equip and softwar  line     which we expect to be boost this year by the partial expens tax benefit that expir at year end  after which spend hit a temporari pothol   for nonresidenti construct  line     we expect a gradual upturn in activ this year  which should strengthen in      as the sizabl amount of vacant space get work down     will now continu our present
chart   present the broad contour of our outlook for the labor market   as shown in the top left panel  we expect that  as firm shed the last vestig of the unusu caution of the past few year  they will continu to add signific to their payrol  part to reliev some of the pressur on workforc that current appear to be a bit overstretch   on our es   month increas in nonfarm payrol will averag a littl more than         job through the end of this year befor taper off next year   as shown in the top right panel  one implic of reliev pressur on the workforc is that product is like to come back into closer align with it structur trend   a consequ of the last few month    worth of data is that the discrep between the level of privat employ report in the establish and household survey  as shown in the middl left panel  has larg close   for reason that are not fulli understood  the establish survey tend to rise more on the upsw of the busi cycl and to soften more in the down phase   nonetheless  have come full cycl  so to speak  sinc       the two measur are in close align  at least momentarili   even with a robust pace of hire  we have the unemploy rate  the middl right panel  remain slight abov our es  of the nairu throughout the project period  for two key reason   first  as shown in the bottom left panel  we expect that  as job opportun continu to open up  the labor forc particip rate will move most of the way back toward it long term averag   second  we expect that the workweek  the bottom right panel  will continu it cyclic rebound   if either of these develop were to fail to materi  pressur on labor resourc could be more intens than we have assum in the baselin   i will come back to this risk short   your next chart turn to the issu of inflat   as illustr in the top left panel  and as you are all well awar  pce price inflat has step up this year from the veri low rate regist last year  both for the overal index  the black line  and for the core  the red line    in recent month  the overal index   shown in the first column of the tabl to the right   has been rise more quick  on averag  than the core  reflect the direct contribut from food and especi energi   the middl left panel decompos core pce inflat  and highlight that the largest part of the pickup in core pce inflat dure the first half of this year relat to the compar period last year reflect the develop on line    name fa  inflat in the price of good other than motor vehicl   as shown on line    firmer price of motor vehicl also have contribut to the acceler this year  as have the price of nonmarket base servic  line     most notabl the imput price of bank servic   the panel to the right take a step away from pure arithmet and attempt to attribut the acceler in the core index to some under caus   accord to our   model  some of the pickup in core inflat this year can be attribut to the indirect effect of higher energi price   anoth chunk  accord to the model  can be attribut to the acceler of import price  an attribut that seem consist with sizabl contribut of good price shown in the left hand panel   the remaind of the pickup  shown on line    like reflect the influenc of a slowli narrow margin of slack and perhap a diminish product dividend  as well as the aforement larger contribut from nonmarket base servic and a varieti of other factor not well captur by our model   as shown in the bottom left panel  commod price escal sharpli through the earli month of this year but have retreat somewhat in recent week   we expect the pass through of higher product cost alreadi in train to continu to boost core consum price inflat through much of this year  befor begin to revers cours around year end   as shown to the right  near term inflat expect  which tend to react to recent trend in overal consum price  have step up notic in the last few month   even so  longer term expect  shown by the red line  thus far seem to have remain reason well anchor   despit the recent upsid surpris on the inflat front  our forecast continu to anticip that inflationari pressur will remain fair well contain  chart   lay out some of our think as to whi this is so   as shown on line   of the tabl  we expect overal pce inflat over the next six quarter to run at a pace of about    percent   in part  this reflect  as shown on line   and in the middl left panel  a partial unwind of the substanti run up in energi price last year and this   and as shown on line   and in the middl right panel  we expect food price inflat to moder  as farmer step up their product in respons to recent high price   moreov  we expect core pce inflat to edg back from it upsw in the first half of this year   a number of factor combin to keep a lid on core inflat in our project   a persist  albeit narrow  margin of slack in labor and product market  the good behavior of long term inflat expect  and the pass through of the more moder turn of energi and import price into core inflat   that said  as yogi berra onc remark     it   s tough to make predict  especi about the futur      with that in mind  the bottom right panel show    percent and    percent confid interv around our baselin forecast   as you can see  the    percent interv around our forecast for inflat in      extend from   percent on the low side to near     percent on the high side  and the    percent interv is correspond wider   one sourc of uncertainti in the outlook that has garner a great deal of commentari late is the gap in resourc util   chart   turn to this topic   the basic idea of this chart is to compar our benchmark measur of the gap   the differ between our es  of the nairu and the actual unemploy rate   with a number of altern indic of the pressur on product resourc   in everi panel  the unemploy gap is plot as the red line   for eas of plot  all seri in the chart are standard to have zero mean and standard deviat equal to    and all are normal so that high valu indic relat intens pressur on product resourc   the top two panel compar the unemploy gap with two altern measur from the labor market   in the panel on the left  the black line show the employ to popul ratio   in the panel on the right  the black line show the   confer board   s measur of whether survey respond think that job are easi or hard to get   these altern measur from the labor market track the contour of the unemploy gap veri close   moreov  the latest read on all three seri are right in line with the valu that they regist in        a  e when labor still seem underutil   the middl panel compar the unemploy gap with two altern measur of capac util   the one on the left be the index produc here at the board  and the one on the right be the measur publish by the institut for suppli manag   as we have note on a number of occas  the frb seri has  for some  e  been signal consider remain slack in util rate in the manufactur sector   by contrast  the most recent read on the ism   s index of capac util seem to indic much tighter condit   we believ  howev  that this appar tension reflect the fact that the ism is measur a differ concept than we are   in particular  in respond to the ism survey  firm appear to take account of the current avail   or lack thereof   of labor and materi   accord  the ism seri reflect short term product bottleneck   in contrast  we ask respond to focus on their maximum sustain product given the capit in place and to assum the avail of suffici labor and materi   the bottom left panel compar the unemploy gap with the output gap  and demonstr that we continu to reli on the regular of this relationship to inform our assumpt for the growth of potenti gdp   inde  the recent   albeit small   error in     s law were one factor in our reassess of the current level of the output gap in this forecast   the panel on the bottom right of the page step outsid the realm of gap and present the chicago feder reserv bank   s nation activ index   despit the fact that this seri is an indic of growth rather than the gap in resourc util  i present it here becaus stock and watson and some other have report that it outperform the unemploy gap as a forecast of inflat  though we have not met with as much success   clear  though  the recent signal from the nai have been much hotter than the one from the unemploy gap   the messag that i take away from this chart are  first  that the bulk of the evid suggest that some slack   even if onli a relat slim amount   remain in the util of product resourc   second  not all plausibl indic sing in unison on this question  and we have to be open to the possibl that actual pressur are quit differ from those that we have assum in the baselin forecast   in other word  we are uncertain about our es  of the gap in resourc util   chart    examin the implic of that uncertainti for the inflat outlook  and place    gap    uncertainti in perspect by compar it with two other import sourc of uncertainti   befor delv into the specif of this chart  let me sketch the general approach   the idea of this chart is to decompos the  book confid interv that i show earlier to give you a rough idea of where that uncertainti might be come from   for a varieti of technic reason  the decomposit here is partial  not exhaust  and most assur is less precis than it appear on this chart    nonetheless  at least in broad stroke  we think it repres a reason first approxim   the top pair of panel consid the implic of uncertainti pertain to the gap in resourc util   specif  as outlin in the bullet in the top left panel  we consid a confid interv of plus or minus    percentag point around our baselin nairu assumpt  which we believ should encompass about two third of the probabl mass   then  as note in the second bullet  we layer on top of that the assumpt of some coeffici uncertainti  equival to a plus or minus one standard error band around the slope coeffici translat a given unemploy gap into it implic for futur inflat   as note in the third bullet  we refer to the combin of nairu uncertainti and coeffici uncertainti as    resourc util uncertainti      the last step  then  is to have frb us tell us how import resourc util uncertainti might be in generat uncertainti in the outlook for inflat  the result of that exercis is plot in the top right panel as the innermost cone  which is shade red   to put that uncertainti in perspect  i   ve plot it against the same  book confid interv that i show you earlier   the middl panel consid the implic of our uncertainti about energi price  again  two form of uncertainti are consid   uncertainti about the price themselv and uncertainti about the pass through into core price inflat   the strike result here is that energi price uncertainti is an even greater sourc of uncertainti about the outlook for inflat than is resourc util uncertainti  accord to frb us  similar  the bottom pair of panel consid the implic of our uncertainti about import price   and onc again  the result from the model indic that we should be at least as concern about this sourc of uncertainti as we are about uncertainti generat by the gap in resourc util   in sum  uncertainti about resourc util is certain not the onli import sourc of uncertainti about inflat over the next year or two  and it may not even be the most import one   in part  this conclus stem from the fact that we believ the pass through coeffici from chang in the unemploy gap to inflat is pretti small   as well  it reflect the fact that the model think it know that coeffici to within plus or minus    percent or so   that combin of circumst impli that resourc util uncertainti will have onli limit implic for inflat uncertainti   on the other hand  energi price move a great deal  and so can leav a big imprint on core inflat even with onli a small pass through coeffici   your next chart take a differ approach to explor uncertainti and summar two scenario from the  book illustr upsid and downsid risk to the inflat outlook   these are the same two scenario discuss in the board brief on monday  in the first scenario  as you will recal from the  book  we consid the possibl that we are too op ist about the suppli side of the economi   specif  we suppos that the nairu is    percent rather than   percent as in the baselin project  and we assum that the bounceback in the particip rate that i show you a few chart earlier will be onli half as larg   in addit  we allow long term   inflat expect to gradual rise   percentag point relat to baselin over the forecast period   as shown by the dash red line in the panel to the right  these assumpt generat a mark wors inflat outcom  assum a fix nomin fund rate  with four quarter core pce inflat rise to about     percent by the end of next year   that said  we believ the inflat project that we put forward in the  book has the risk well balanc on both side   one of the downsid risk that we see is illustr in the middl panel  which show the markup of price over unit labor cost  the most recent read on this variabl have been the highest sinc at least the end of the second world war   and while our project call for the deviat of the markup from it long run averag to narrow  it certain could narrow by more and at a fa  pace   in particular  in the cours of ramp up product  firm may bid up wage fa  than in the baselin   at the same  e  competit pressur may be so strong that they more than offset the price effect of higher unit labor cost   in the altern scenario  we assum that the markup move halfway back to it long term averag  and as shown by the dash red line in the bottom right panel  the downward pressur on inflat of even a partial return along those line over the next six quarter could be quit power   nathan

your final chart display your econom project for      and        as shown in the top panel  the central tendenc of your project for the growth of real gdp this year is onli slight differ than it was at the februari meet  and the central tendenc for the unemploy rate in the fourth quarter is unrevis   for inflat  no februari comparison is avail becaus this is the first  e that you have been ask to forecast core rather than overal inflat   for next year  your central    tendenc indic a moder in the pace of growth  a slight declin in the unemploy rate  and littl chang in core pce price inflat   as we have alreadi note  some import inform becam avail after the close of the  book   in respons to that inform  the staff trim our project for real growth this year and lift our forecast for core pce price inflat  for refer  the figur in the final column   label    staff      pertain to this updat project rather than the  book forecast   over the next sever day  you may wish to consid whether to updat your project  if you decid to do so  we request that you submit your revis forecast to dave   and me by the close of busi on friday of this week   we would now be pleas to take ani question you may have
i have a question for     first  i want to applaud the analyt focus on the behavior of the price markup sinc it obvious has swung a lot in the last coupl of year and it is a key swing determin in the inflat outlook   i was wonder to what extent the markup is a forward look variabl in the model you use   in mani analyt or theoret model of price determin it is  in the same sens that the save rate is a forward look variabl in the perman incom model   second  i was just curious   what kind of error band or uncertainti band chart would it be possibl to construct about the price markup
we have a new specif of frb us that incorpor explicit forward look behavior in the set of price by firm   in a manner that   s often refer to as a neoclass synthesi  we have some sort of momentum base or backward look influenc on price set as well as some explicit forward look behavior   that forward look behavior in the wage   price block in frb us is ration in the sens that it   s model consist within that three equat block   and rough speak  both are about equal influenti   so if you thought about a coeffici of   in the context of acceler inflat  you   d have about half on the backward look portion and about half on the forward look portion  with respect to construct error band  we wrestl with that issu fair hard in put togeth the exhibit that explor uncertainti  and we decid not to do it becaus the markup itself   isn   t a fundament variabl in the model   it deriv from and reflect a lot of other more fundament influenc   the conclus we arriv at was that  if we had shown you confid interv that might be generat by markup uncertainti  we would have end up sort of doubl count sourc of uncertainti   so in that framework it   s difficult to put a confid interv around uncertainti   more impressionist  just eyebal this chart suggest to me that there is a lot of uncertainti about the futur behavior of the markup   we   ve wrestl as well with whether that variabl is best thought of as a stationari variabl that return to a well defin mean   you can see from the chart in the middl panel in chart    that  depend on what sampl period you chose to draw the blue line  you would get a differ number for the averag to which it should be return   so i think in general there is a good deal of uncertainti surround the futur behavior of the markup even though we have a hard  e actual quantifi it for you
with respect to chart    i notic that the profit share is shown as the ratio of econom profit befor tax to gnp   whi not to corpor gdp   or if you want to includ the foreign earn  put that in on the denomin as well   whi are you use gnp
i think just becaus that   s a convent we   ve had for a long  e  but we can plot it to gdp
let me put it this way   some convent get outmod  we are no longer drive the model t ford  so whi are we do this
we can certain chang that
i know the  book use this measur   it has alway struck me as a fair histor practic from a  e when we didn   t have data sourc
we   ll be happi to chang it   the impress that one get from altern measur of the profit share use a denomin of the type suggest basic
well  it   s slight differ   in the chart  the      low is higher relat to       and a few other relationship here are differ   that   s becaus there is a signific move share involv lot of noncorpor gdp trend   second  with respect to nonresidenti structur  i haven   t look at the relationship between the stock of nonresidenti structur in constant dollar and potenti   how do those two variabl run against each other these day   i   m rais the question in the context of one measur of whether we   re run into capac restraint and whether or not structur per se are as reflect of that as they use to be mani year ago   i was curious   how should one be look at industri construct  for exampl  or broader privat nonresidenti construct as an indic of whether there is ampl capac relat to potenti
i would offer a coupl of observ   the first is that there is a long term trend over the past twenti to thirti year for corpor invest to be shift toward shorter live asset and away from structur becaus of pronounc price declin in real term   so the stock of structur in the nipa has not been grow veri rapid  and i   m confid it has been grow less rapid than potenti
i think it alway has
yes  i think that   s right   and in the past coupl of year the stock has been grow particular slowli becaus construct has been at a low level   at the same  e  there   s a lot of unus space out there   when we look at vacanc rate for the offic sector  they are still close to the high that we saw in the last coupl of quarter  and industri vacanc rate are still pretti high   realli onli in the retail sector   it appear that vacanc are at relat low histor level
if you combin all the vacanc rate   well  we don   t have data for the servic sector  which is grow   the reason i rais the issu is that  if we   re get concern about our measur of gap  there are altern test of shortag and we ought to look at them becaus that   s obvious crucial to our assess of the outlook and our polici decis  governor bernank
thank you   it didn   t pass my notic that the first part of the present was in the form of a financi stabil report  which i found veri use  and i commend the staff for that   i have a question about chart   for the household sector and about chart   for the busi sector  where you show the averag interest rate on the stock of debt vis  vis the rate on new debt   i just note that that   s an averag and  if we   re think about financi distress  we might be concern about the tail of the distribut   do we have ani inform about the   th percentil or anyth of that sort that would describ whether a signific portion of household and firm are in a danger zone
in the household sector  we definit think there are pocket where financi problem still exist   the bankruptci rate has come down over the past half year from where it was at the end of last year  but it is still quit high   most delinqu rate have been come down as well  but the level of some of them are still relat elev   so there is certain a compon of the household sector in which financi stress is a consider   as for the busi sector  our feel is that the tail has probabl gotten quit small at this point   we do look at the most distress part of the specul grade univers of nonfinanci firm  and for them there has been a mark improv in the type of financi ratio that i show here
i want to follow up a bit on what   was ask   not so much on the markup question but on the uncertainti analys regard inflat   i notic that in the  book the path for the cpi is similar to that for the pce   i e   there   s a blip up this year that fade off toward the end of the year and into next year  for similar reason   if you were to do the uncertainti calcul use core cpi instead of pce  would they look differ   and what would the number look like on the upper end of that
no reason come immedi to mind on whi the main qualit find of chart    wouldn   t hold true with respect to the cpi as well   energi price have an import influenc on core cpi
the mechan of it don   t make the result look ani differ
there are differ in weight  so i   m sure that there would be small chang  but i can   t think of whi qualit it wouldn   t be quit similar
my recollect is as well  from the general  book project we do  that the size of the confid interv around our core cpi forecast are similar to those around our core pce forecast
just look at the most recent three month chang in the core cpi  an annual rate number begin with   has an impact on the way peopl think about futur inflat   i still think peopl look more at the cpi number than at the pce number just becaus peopl are use to see the cpi and it is more relev to them   so  i   m wonder whether number that could potenti stay on the high side might have a greater impact   becaus of their effect on inflat expect    in term of this distribut of uncertainti
that could be  through an expect channel   as i note with respect to the channel in the bottom right corner of chart    that   s one of the reason we think the michigan   survey result for the short term expect have move up as sharpli as they have   it reflect the inflat that individu are experienc
yes   there   s hard anybodi who believ that price for them are increas at onli a     percent rate
right  but that was true even when we think price realli were increas at     percent
that   s veri true becaus for most peopl the thing they care about most were go up more than that
thank you  mr  chairman   i just want to compliment the staff on the work in the chart show on inflat   i thought it was quit thorough and shed a lot of light on an obvious veri import area of concern for this committe   i was hope that you would shed a littl more light on the expect side  which you didn   t talk a great deal about here   we   re go through a period now when final price increas have acceler   some of the increas are be pass through to the core measur  which is go up in part becaus of temporari factor that hope will phase out so that the core rate will be go up at a somewhat slower pace but still at a rate higher than we   ve seen in the immedi past   i was wonder if you   ve thought at all about how this affect expect for inflat  the upward shift is explain now in term of temporari factor  but when we get past this   if we   re correct about these temporari factor and they are inde transitori and ceas   what impact will this have on inflat expect
again  with refer to that panel in the bottom corner of chart    we would expect to see short term inflat expect come back down as commod price and energi price moder   when we run a veri simpl regress of this short term inflat   expect on some lag valu of actual top line consum price inflat  we can explain most of the recent run up in the michigan survey on inflat expect   so it look about rough in line with what one would have expect  given histor experi and the influenc of those price on the expect that peopl report to the survey taker   if the energi price moder that we anticip come to pass  we think those inflat expect will come back down   we view inflat expect as a pretti import part of the dynam and the challeng that you confront as monetari polici maker   and we think one thing that   s make your job a littl easier than it would otherwis be is that longer term inflat expect haven   t move up as yet   but as everyon around this tabl is awar  the credibl associ with that is not someth that can be taken for grant
we   ll be watch this veri care
as will we
thank you   i think the discuss of the inflat outlook has been help  but it   rais some question about the sens of op  in the project in term of inflat come back down as quick as it     i   d just like to ask for your reaction becaus it has been our experi  both when inflat come down and when it goe up  that we underpredict the chang either way   it is on it way back up now  and we   re say it   s not go to continu at a veri strong pace  and yet histori tell us that we some  get behind the curv ourselv   part of the reason i worri about that is that the output gap is actual fair small and close rapid  i think  at least  that   s what some project are show   and the differ between the unemploy rate and the nairu is fair small  in fact  depend on what the nairu realli is  the differ could be zero   look at where polici is right now  the fed fund rate is so low   relat to where neutral most like is  and we get to neutral so slowli in this project  that i think this inflat outlook is fair op ist   even with the error band around it   i just have a sens that we perhap need to be less op ist on this   my view is base upon the degre to which i think the project are overst the differ between the nairu and the actual unemploy rate and are not take into account just how accommod polici is right now and will be in the near term futur   i guess i   m ask you to be somewhat defens on this  but it would be help for me if you could do that
let me tri to give you some defens content without the defens overlay
fair enough   thank you
first of all  i think one way to phrase your question would be to say  how sure are you that inflat is go to come back down   i   d say that is about a         bet  which is pretti close to even money   but given the rang of those confid interv  i   m tri to point out to the committe that there   s a lot of uncertainti surround that question  in term of how the baselin will evolv   a second piec of evid i would throw out come down to essenti the same observ   with regard to how well our model can account for the evolut of inflat  we think an r  for an equat for the chang in inflat is someth like       this mean that half of the variat is not explain by the econometr equat  imperfect as it is  even though we   ve had a lot of  e in the workshop to tinker with the model  third  recogn that there   s a wide error band around the baselin forecast  i still think that  on balanc  the consider that went into the construct of the forecast make it a somewhat better bet that inflat is go to moder from here forward than pick up or stay the same   again  those consider includ the revers of a number of factor that we believ to be   transitori  which were push inflat up in the first half of this year   we anticip  as you note  some continu modest downward pressur from resourc util   we think we may see a littl benefit from a continu solid product perform and the revers of the trajectori for food price and import price   so those are some of the factor that we think line up to make moder inflat a better bet  though not by a wide margin  than intensifi inflat
i have two type of question   first  on the inflat topic we   ve been talk about  i was struck that in chart    you are argu that the inflat we   ve seen deriv from primarili two sourc   one involv a gap type analysi that you   re evalu in term of the nairu  and the other involv element of pass through   you have not put forth ani concept that what we may be deal with is basic some sort of fundament speed effect  mayb indirect relat to the nairu   essenti a speed effect versus a potenti growth rate concept hasn   t come through in your analysi   and in some sens  a simpler view of inflat as pure a monetari phenomenon also hasn   t come through   you have chosen the three sourc of uncertainti shown in the chart  i think  becaus they reflect recent histori   but as you consid other way of forecast and think about inflat  do these other theori or approach to predict inflat or understand inflat have ani role in your model or in the way you think about inflat go forward
first  with respect to the two type of channel  i would like to underscor that the decomposit that is present here in this chart is partial   it is not an exhaust decomposit of all sourc of uncertainti   in particular  one thing that we didn   t display was a confid interv associ with the error term   the reason is that the error term emb so   mani differ influenc  includ inflat expect  which presid   refer to  commod price pass through that may occur through channel other than just energi price  competit pressur  and regulatori influenc   it   s the bucket into which everyth in the    all els    categori goe   so i would not want to character our view as just two channel   gap and these other variabl  on the absenc of a speed effect  we look pretti hard for a speed effect and dispos of a lot of degre of freedom in the statist world in that search   we think there is a discern speed effect in the price of item that are in relat inelast short term suppli   but for final core pce price  we can   t find it   and we   re reassur in that by refer to some particular histor episod like the recoveri from the veri deep recess of          when the unemploy rate was rise veri rapid and yet inflat continu to declin   now  if there were a strong speed effect  it should have shown up dure that period  and it didn   t   so we   ve look hard on the econometr  and we   ve done some case studi  and neither approach lead us to think that there   s much there  with respect to direct monetari influenc   whether money itself show up in inflat   we think it   s import  but we think it   s import in set the background factor that we believ influenc the inflat dynam more fundament   we think that what monetari polici is do is alter the balanc of factor like the gap and resourc util  for exampl   when we have move to test a direct influenc of money in our price equat  it   s a littl like a mirag on the highway   some  it   s there a littl bit  and some  it disappear   we can   t find a reliabl strong statist relationship   so we think this is a good  albeit imperfect  framework to use for the entir analysi
the other question i have deal with chart    on hous price   my question is about the footnot  which say that the rent   price ratio is adjust for bias in the trend of both rent and price   is that where you pick up demograph and lifecycl factor   what are these bias in the trend  and how   one think about chang demograph and the relat attract of own a home versus rent   give me some sens of whether or not the shape of the curv that you show here is like to revers  as you impli  or like to stay relat low
the bias refer to in that footnot were realli technic bias in the construct of the two measur shown here  the rent measur and the price measur   had we not adjust for them  the rent to price ratio would have been much lower at the end point   so it would have look more alarm   in part we think the publish data have some technic problem that need to be taken care of befor this analysi can be done in a way that is meaning  with regard to the question of own versus rent  it depend to some extent on what is happen to interest rate becaus that chang that calcul at the margin   so it   s realli import to plot ani kind of valuat measur relat to an opportun cost   just show the rent to price ratio i think would have been somewhat mislead  it   s realli that gap that we think is the meaning measur of valuat   and it look somewhat rich  take account of the fact that interest rate are relat low and incom growth has been relat strong   i don   t want to leav the impress that we think there   s a huge hous bubbl   we believ a lot of the rise in hous price is root in fundament   but even after you account for the fundament  there   s a part of the increas that is hard to explain
i  too  thought the present by the staff was veri good this morn  i must say  as one who is go to talk about similar thing in my own remark  mine is go to   sound a littl lame in comparison   but there was one issu that you didn   t talk about this morn  and not much was said about it in the brief on monday or in the  book either   and that is  despit the low util rate  wage have kept up     that worri you   is this someth that is a revers to normal in a regress equat  or is this the start of someth that we ought to worri about
we think wage are be support by the rapid product growth that we   ve had over the last few year   we think that is ad a tenth this year  for exampl  compar with last year and anoth coupl of tenth next year   on the other hand  overal we don   t see eci compens acceler great   one of the influenc on the eci that we believ will hold it down is health insur cost  which we expect to contribut less to the rise in eci this year   also  we actual think that in      the growth of eci was a littl stronger than we could account for in our model  and we project that that puzzl will go away  so the balanc of all those factor leav our project just slight flat this year compar with last year and up onli a littl next year  there are risk   one of the risk to that compens project  which we   ve highlight  is the declin in the markup   if worker bid more aggress for their share of the pie than we built into the baselin or if firm are more eager to ramp up their product than we   ve assum  that compens trajectori could turn out to be too op ist
governor    those figur did get our attent  though   there were upward revis to the nonfarm busi comp hour start in the fourth quarter of last year  and we also miss on the eci in the first quarter   it came in higher than we had project   that was one of the factor that prompt us to go back and look at our es  of both the nairu and potenti output   we made a veri margin  almost cosmet  upward revis to our es  of the nairu   we rais it by just a tenth   but we also revis down potenti output just becaus we   thought the overal constel of wage and price data was more negat than we had anticip  given our previous es  of the level of potenti output and the gap   so i think we   ve tri to respond to that  but it was someth we found troubl vis  vis the view that we held in april
i want to follow up on what you just said      you mention that less slack wasn   t the major contributor to the bulk of the rise in inflat  but you didn   t comment on exact how much your es  for slack has chang   can you tell us how much you reduc that es  from the  e of the may  book   you made a few remark about that  but is that the sole explan for the chang in the fed fund rate path from the may  book to the current  book   there is a signific chang in that path   is it all a reflect of the chang in that es  for slack
i   d say that two factor are behind the revis we made to the feder fund rate assumpt that underli our forecast   one  import  was the downward revis we made to potenti output   in essenc  those downward revis suggest to us that you need to be closer to neutral by the end of our forecast period than we had previous assum   a piec of that   and these are all simultan determin within our forecast system   was that the inflat figur were higher as well   we didn   t think that revis up our inflat forecast as much as we did  without make a correspond adjust to the feder fund rate   and therefor allow the real feder fund rate to be on a weaker path than we had in the last forecast   would be warrant   so the higher inflat and the lower es  of potenti output suggest to us that the under path for the fund rate probabl need to be steeper than we had been assum previous
presid  n
dave  one thing that surpris me about the baselin forecast and also about most of the simul was the flat ten year treasuri rate   if i want to take  say  the market base fund rate scenario and assum that the ten year rate goe up about half as much as the fund rate over that period  then as a first approxim should i just extrapol or interpol the real growth and unemploy number base on that   or do you think there   s more go on there
mayb i   ll just start off by talk for a moment about how we got the assumpt for the ten year rate   we begin by ask ourselv where we think the ten year rate would go by the end of our forecast period under the market base assumpt for the fund rate  our guess is that it would be up about    percentag point from where it is now  just use the usual term structur argument that relat short term rate to long term rate   so we deviat from that by hold the ten year rate essenti flat   that reflect our belief that  if our view for inflat turn out to be correct  there will be a favor market surpris that will keep the ten year rate from rise along the path that it otherwis would have taken
in our altern simul for that market base fund rate  we have the ten year treasuri bond rate come up    basi point by the end of the forecast period
right   i was specul that it might be more than that   presum you   ve got a greater impact on the ten year rate in the market base scenario
obvious  it depend a littl on whether rate move up earlier in our project period or later   my guess is that if there were a signific surpris on long term interest rate next year  most of the impact of that would probabl be felt late in the year and move into
presid  n  i ask the staff to calcul for me if we follow exact the path of the fund rate that is now built into market  where the ten year rate would be a year from now   and their answer was    basi point higher than it is today   so  it is not    percent of the rise in the fund rate
i have a question on chart   on the commerci real estat valuat   have live through the         period when the noi net oper incom    price ratio was down to the level it is today  i look at that period as abnorm becaus we had tax chang that were retroact  which basic put a lot of real estat project and ownership under water   so we had a tremend upheav in the real estat market  with peopl file for bankruptci and dump properti   it worri me that we   re back down in a sens to a situat that is compar to that sever turn in the real estat market   i realli look at that as a good exampl of how retroact tax affect peopl   s return target when they enter into long live project
i was actual here at the board dure that period  and i rememb that we were concern as well in the late      s about real estat valuat and the amount of construct still go on given that the tax benefit had been withdrawn in        we did not realli understand what the rational was in the market   ul  it turn out that there was a massiv amount of over construct and lend standard that were too lax   i think there are some reason to be watch of develop in the commerci construct sector at this point   it is clear that the compens for risk has gotten somewhat thinner in this market than it was throughout the     s  presum after market particip had learn some lesson from the veri thin compens that they accept through the      s   on the other hand  we do see some rather substanti differ in the structur of the commerci real estat market at this  e   lend standard do seem to have   held much firmer   and there   s a lot more transpar in the market now becaus of the more widespread avail of data on price and rent to market particip   so we think the decisionmak is better   i wouldn   t say it is perfect   we do feel that there is some reason to be alert to develop in that market
just to follow up on what roger was ask about the panel in chart   on hous valuat   in that panel the relat movement of the two measur is somewhat key to at least the intuit persuas of the argument that hous might be overvalu   i understand the unit of the real long term treasuri yield   i don   t understand the unit of the rent to price ratio
the rent and the price data come from differ sourc  they are not part of an integr system   the rent data are from the cpi  which is itself onli an index number   so there is no way to say the rent   price ratio is   percent   like an earn   price ratio  for exampl
it is proport to whatev that number would be
yes   we could make the level of the red line anyth we want to  but we could onli move it in a level adjust up and down
but you set the scale  too  right   you could set it so that the zero are the same on both axe
right   with creativ chart we could make the relationship between the two seri shift up and down howev we want   that   s whi we   re stress
but that   s not so for the ratio between those two seri   that is invari to the scale
yes  that   s true  they ought to have the same zero it seem
no  no   if you have a relat measur that is an actual ratio  the ratio of the two number is invari to what the relat number is
that   s right   but in the chart  the staff has the zero set at veri differ place on the two scale
you can   t trust them to do it right    laughter
i   m just wonder  how did you decid where to put the zero   if you put it much closer to where the zero is for the long run treasuri rate  the squiggl in the red line would be a lot smaller
you can make the squiggl as small or as larg as you want
right   and your argument has to do with the size of the squiggl
no  i think the argument has to do with the size of the gap between the two  and the current gap relat to it averag over histori
the scale will not chang the fact that the gap is close   the conclus is independ of the scale   you could tri ani variat you want  and that gap will alway close
the gap between these two line
no matter what we use for our chart convent  the gap would be relat narrow now compar with it histor averag
just take the ratio of the two ratio  and it will be go
that   s fine for now  down
further question   i notic in some of the month data that the product number in the second quarter seem to be come in under the     percent  book forecast   is that your sens   i note that the compens per hour seem okay  but the figur implicit in the person incom data at least suggest that we would be get a somewhat higher unit labor cost than is in the  book
in the  book we had nonfarm busi product at     percent   a quick updat of that base on the inform that we receiv on friday and monday would put it at     percent
so it   s a somewhat higher unit labor cost
unit labor cost are up      right
okay   who would like to start the committe discuss  presid
thank you  mr  chairman   the expans in the seventh district now appear extrem broad base   veri few sector are weak  and some are boom   this may be hyperbol  but sever of our contact said that the busi climat was as strong as they can rememb   one of our director  whose privat s corpor show about forti differ busi  said that he can   t recal when so mani compani in so mani differ industri were do so well   similar  the nation temporari help firm headquart in our district report that their busi is final follow a classic recoveri growth path   and the chicago purchas manag    report  which is be releas this morn  continu to show expans  albeit with a sharp declin from    in may to      in june   we recent held our annual automot outlook symposium  and the overal mood was upbeat   thirti five industri expert submit forecast  and their consensus was for light motor vehicl sale to increas to    million unit in the second half of   this year and be at about the same pace in        these number are lower than the  book forecast  especi for         and a truck industri analyst forecast that product in medium  and heavi duti truck would rise from about         last year to         in      and to         in       so  given that the expans in real activ seem to be on such a solid foot  i   d like to focus on what we   ve heard about emerg inflationari pressur   certain  more firm are report price increas   euphem like    price restor    and    fuller price    are common  some price increas are relat to higher energi cost and strengthen worldwid demand for steel and other commod   we know that price for mani commod have come down of late  as was mention befor  but it is still too earli to know whether they   ve peak   mani other report suggest bottleneck in sector where sale have increas rapid  such as construct equip  agricultur equip  and fiberboard packag   in some case  inventori of raw materi and part were low  in other  suppli chain bottleneck led firm to use higher cost altern like air freight to avoid part shortag and product delay   so will these price increas becom perman   we obvious don   t know yet   one good sign we   ve heard is that  while a number of our contact said they were will to accept recent impos price surcharg from their supplier  they were still resist base price increas   this may be a distinct without a differ  but mani of our contact seem determin to keep pressur on their supplier   as soon as commod price fall  they expect the surcharg to come off   and their plan still assum lower input cost   most contact report that their profit margin are good  so they may have quit a bit of room to absorb cost increas without rais price   inde  i get the feel that mani of them do not expect their hefti profit margin to continu indefinit    turn to the nation outlook  with labor market firm  the expans appear to be on a solid self sustain track   our own outlook for econom growth is a bit weaker than the  book   s for       and a bit stronger for        but the differ are small   we now see core pce inflat rise this year and settl down to around     percent next year   we interpret the recent increas in inflat as larg reflect temporari effect rather than more sustain price pressur   and this view seem consist with comment from our region contact  which suggest that the economi is not run into fundament capac constraint  with regard to unit labor cost  we expect to see a sustain pickup as labor market tighten  but i don   t think that the bulk of these increas will be pass on to price   rather  as i mention earlier  i expect that most will come out of current elev markup as labor   s share of incom move back up toward more normal level   of cours  there is a lot of uncertainti surround this scenario   i am hear increas concern that the feder reserv might be behind the curv   i person think our credibl is solid  but if higher inflationari expect becom entrench  that would obvious make our job much more difficult  if inflat remain on the moder path that i expect  then a measur pace of polici move would like be appropri   howev  the committe must have the flexibl to act more aggress if inflationari pressur intensifi   we think financi market as well as the nonfinanci sector could handl aggress move  if need   this was also the view of academ and busi economist we met with last week   so the polici statement should reiter what we   ve all been say in public   that we will do whatev is necessari to maintain price stabil  the statement should not give the appear of constrain the committe   s freedom of action at subsequ meet
thank you  mr  chairman   by almost ani measur  econom activ has pick up in new england and show sign of be on a solid upward trend   region employ grew for the third consecut month in may  bring the region   s job count even with it year ago level   onli in massachusett has the employ level continu to be below that of a year ago   similar  the unemploy rate in the region  while bounc from month to month  is well below both it high and the compar data for the nation as a whole   consum confid has been off of late  possibl reflect lower wage gain in the region than nation  and spend is grow more slowli than elsewher as well   quit possibl both of these will pick up as the employ situat continu to brighten   in that regard  busi confid is good  busi spend is report to be solid   merchandis export have been grow strong   and the stock index that bloomberg   for the region have outperform their nation counterpart  even the fiscal pictur for state govern is brighten  with revenu growth abov budget for the first half of fiscal year       though structur deficit and prospect fund challeng remain  anecdot  most contact report strengthen in current busi condit and in their outlook for the futur   move  as one said  from cautious op  to more op  than caution   most of our contact  includ member of our new england advisori council and attende at recent econom forum we   ve held  report increas in sale  order  or revenu in the first quarter of the year   virtual all of them also mention input cost increas  includ for steel  oil and oil relat product  and transport and

pass on cost increas   even in the high competit world of suppli car manufactur  price increas relat to steel and oil cost were pass on  and those increas stuck   find suffici capabl labor even for entri level posit has becom a problem as well   in particular in the hospit industri  the limit on h  b visa are a serious problem for season firm   a lack of labor suppli continu to encourag  if not inspir  the search for product improv at firm larg and small  in sum  the situat is better in new england now than at ani  e sinc late      and there seem to be littl reason to suspect that the pace of overal progress will diminish much  at least over the next year or year and a half   new england has lag the unit state a bit in the recoveri  but i expect it will catch up this summer or later in the year  look at the nation data and think about the worri at this  e last year  one can onli marvel at how fast thing can chang from job loss to job growth  from polici induc to what look like self sustain demand  and from worri about deflat to real concern about inflat  incom data suggest that both consum and busi demand are solid  and the pace of hire has surpass expect   the rest of the world is grow  and fiscal polici is like to remain expansionari this year   assum curtail of the invest tax credit next year  fiscal polici will be less expansionari   but who know about continu spend on the militari or otherwis  boston   s forecast for the next year and a half don   t differ much from those of the  book when done use similar fund rate assumpt   that is  we see what one could view as a near perfect combin of quit solid growth  continu strong product trend  slowli   fall unemploy  and rate of inflat that moder after the pickup in the first half of        this forecast is shape by the assess of slack remain in the economi and the belief that growth will not be constrain by resourc for some  e  perhap not until year end        thus  broad base inflationari pressur   not just those associ with what is seen as a temporari blip in oil price   should not be an issu   under both boston   s and the board   s staff forecast  polici should begin to tighten but can move up slowli to a level below that of market expect by the end of       howev  i think this forecast outcom is about as good as it get   even if it is the most like outcom  the risk around it seem to me to be substanti and appear to be weight on the upsid  at least to the extent that such risk don   t involv unpredict geopolit event   that is  it is hard for me to feel particular confid about a sizabl remain output gap when inflat data for both the first and second quarter  whether measur by the cpi or pce and whether look at overal or on the basi of core es   show a substanti uptick   the best guess may be that this sharp upturn is temporari  but two thing about inflat seem undebat   it has flatten  and it near  to medium term trajectori is up   just as the speed of the pickup in employ has been a surpris this year  so too could we be surpris on the upsid by inflat  the  book altern captur this in the higher inflat expect scenario  but i suspect that some combin of stronger demand  less room to grow  and rise inflat expect could work togeth to produc an outcom more negat than that altern   that   s perhap not a high probabl event  but it   s one that   concern me  in that regard  i think the  e has come to start move the fed fund rate up and to get real short term rate first to a posit posit and then to a more neutral level   the market expect this  if we don   t start do it  i think the yield curv probabl will steepen with a rise in the inflat   premium   moreov  i also think it   s  e to remov from our statement ani character of how we will act in the futur   let   s say what we are do  whi we are do it  and comment on the risk  but let   s not make ani impli commit about the pace of our action go forward  the risk are real   we may or may not want to character them as most one side but we ought to reserv the capabl to deal with them as we see fit when  and if  they materi
thank you  mr  chairman   econom activ in the third district continu to expand and  in contrast to the last  e we met  i can now report that we   ve seen solid job growth in the region   payrol employ in our three state rose     percent from the first quarter to the first two month of the second quarter  match the nation increas   each of the state has report employ gain  and the gain were widespread across industri  with employ up in all of the major sector except manufactur   the most recent data show that in new jersey and delawar payrol employ has recov from the recess trauma   but pennsylvania still has a way to go to make up for job lost sinc the start of the recoveri  specif  pennsylvania payrol remain about    percentag point below the recess trough  the three state    unemploy rate edg down to     percent in april and may   we are still receiv some report that firm are have difficulti find qualifi worker  a point we just heard from boston  the other sector in our district continu to perform well   retail sale and general merchandis remain on a fair consist upward trend  although auto sale have slow somewhat and appear to be softer than elsewher in the nation   most retail have becom more op ist about sale in the second half of the year   commerci real estat market in the region remain soft  but residenti construct activ and home sale have been strong   home price in our region   continu to appreci at a steadi rate  but our contact in the residenti real estat market said that some home are take longer to sell now than they did earlier this year   manufactur activ in the region continu to expand   our busi outlook survey index of general activ increas to      percent in june  up from      percent in may   the index has been in posit territori for over a year now   the more forward look index of new order and shipment also improv in june  with all industri classif except food and transport show posit read   the head of a larg truck compani in our region report that order from march to earli june have been as strong as is usual seen dure the peak transport month preced the christma holiday   a phenomenon he say is extrem rare   inde  it is veri rare to see success strong month at peak level dure a nonpeak period  we continu to get read of rise price in our region   the same truck compani contact i just mention said that fuel surcharg are common and that even his largest custom are now will to pay these surcharg   so transport cost are rise signific   he also report that labor is in veri short suppli   and he expect trucker    wage rate to rise substanti this year  follow the first ever success strike by independ truck contractor   that strike occur in california and  accord to the press  is spread across the countri   the price paid and price receiv index in our manufactur survey eas a bit in june but remain at nine year high   in respons to a special survey question in may  near half of our respond said they had rais price sinc the begin of the year  and more than half expect to rais price in the third quarter   the expect among contact in the busi communiti are for continu improv in the region   s economi  and i share their view  turn to the nation  incom data have confirm that the recoveri has reach the point of be self sustain   product activ continu to expand at a good pace  busi   invest is acceler  and consum spend continu to rise at a moder pace   with the confirm that solid job growth is final at hand  it is my view that the economi has left the recoveri phase and is now in what we could call an econom expans  when i compar the board staff   s forecast with our  i find that the  book project  even the most updat one  see a littl less under strength in the economi than our forecast  we achiev similar outcom  but the philadelphia staff think that those outcom are consist with a steeper fund rate path than that in the  book   we see a bit fa  growth this year than the  book         percent compar with the updat     percent   and somewhat stronger growth of     percent next year compar with the  book   s     percent   the  book project slower product growth and thus fa  job growth than in our forecast   while we expect job growth to averag around         job per month for the second half of the year through       the  book project that nonfarm payrol will rise at an averag rate exceed         per month dure the rest of this year befor slow to         a month for much of       yet our most signific differ with the  book is our view on inflat   it is obvious the subject of this meet  as we can see from the chart and the discuss   we agre that the first quarter spike in core inflat  especi core cpi inflat  will not be repeat  howev  even given our steeper fund rate path  we see a rise trend in inflat while the  book has a deceler   in particular  we see the core pce price index acceler from     percent this year to     percent next year  while the  book see it deceler from     to     percent   our forecast reflect the histor evid that extend period of negat real rate are follow by rapid real growth and rise inflat  and that forecast is support by anecdot evid that a grow fraction of firm report that they are rais or plan to rais price   we could be wrong  but it is hard for me to believ that the  book has it exact right    as with all forecast  there are risk   on the growth side  i see the risk as balanc   we have a conserv view of oil price  assum a modest drop from the level of the past few month follow by essenti flat oil price from the fall of this year through        my read of the board   s memo on energi and our own staff   s work suggest that we need not be too concern about the effect of the rise to date in oil price   the increas in real term has not been as larg as past shock  although it appear to have been more prolong  and the economi is less reliant on energi for product   there is some risk of a larger  more persist rise in oil price than we have assum  which could be both contractionari and inflationari   on the other hand  oil price could drop appreci for ani number of reason  on the inflat side  i see the risk as balanc  provid that we begin to take the necessari step on the path back toward neutral   the fed has alreadi provid a lot of liquid for the financi system  and that degre of liquid will becom increas unnecessari and counterproduct as the expans proceed   i believ that we now need to take the necessari step to ensur that the recent acceler in inflat   not becom embed in inflat expect   that mean take action today   let   s start this process of put the fund rate on an upward trajectori   at this point  i do not realli know the speed at which we will need to move the fed fund rate up in the futur   we all know it will depend upon the incom inform we receiv on econom condit and on our assess of the outlook at subsequ meet  given the uncertainti surround inflat dynam  i believ we should put ourselv in a posit of maximum flexibl with respect to polici go forward   in this regard  the less we say now about futur action  the better i would feel   in my view  we should be in the posit to respond to the incom data without have to consid whether a particular action is at varianc with what we said at our last meet   that suggest simplifi our statement today and or   limit our commit to the expect speed with which we think we will have to adjust polici  such languag was use when we face unusu econom circumst   today  in my view  languag as polici has overstay it welcom
thank you  mr  chairman   busi condit in the fourth district began to improv notic just befor our last meet in may  and the outlook remain somewhat posit   after a long period of relat quiet  my busi contact are now busi adjust to higher sale volum   they are instal new capit equip and reorgan busi process   they are also cope with the volatil price environ and  in a few case  are begin to add to payrol   so most peopl in the fourth district are expect a solid year   i don   t realli see much evid that the pace of econom activ is pois to acceler further as we head into the second half of this year   so the  book project for real gdp growth in the     to   percent rang this year  with the pace slow somewhat next year  seem consist with what i hear from my busi contact in the district  ceo remain disciplin about ad to their payrol   they are not allow the stronger demand for their product to shift their focus away from improv product   i hear consist stori from busi person  whether they   re from larg compani or small compani  that they continu to see opportun to add to their product gain today and into the futur   mani of the compani execut that i speak with are talk more and more about    lean    manufactur  they are use these lean manufactur strategi to signific increas the through put in their facil by take unproduct step out of the product process   and the end result includ greater flexibl in their schedul and enhanc custom of their product for their custom   they find that they are hold smaller inventori and that their custom need to hold   smaller inventori  and they are abl to produc more volum with almost no addit employe  in some case  after compani    lean out    the factori floor  they move on to lean out their back offic oper   so i   ve seen  at least in the manufactur sector  continu growth in product  the ceo of a veri larg global produc of pneumat and hydraul equip told me that his compani   s product has been increas at    percent annual rate recent and that he see that continu for the next sever year   i know that might be an extrem case  but i   m hear that kind of stori from lot of ceo i talk to  again becaus of their use of some of these lean manufactur techniqu   so i will not be surpris to see the elev level of product that we have been wit in the manufactur sector continu for a while   now  on the one hand  the strong product growth has enabl firm to keep their unit labor cost lower than otherwis  and that  they say  has enabl them to limit price increas   on the other hand  economi do tend to display a close correspond over  e between the rate of product growth and the rate of return on capit and the equilibrium real rate of interest   consequ  and especi sinc we   ve been talk about the low rate of domest save in the unit state  as i look ahead i do expect to see forc at work that are consist with a rise in the equilibrium real rate of interest   i   m less confid about the magnitud and  e of that rise than i am about the general direct  at our last meet  i express some concern about the signific increas in commod price and the messag that i was get from ceo that they had more price power   i was becom concern that those were the first sign of a fundament chang in the inflat process  so i spent a great deal of  e dure this intermeet period talk with busi leader about this issu   the result of my convers is that i am not see strong evid that the recent   upsurg in commod and consum price is foreshadow a buildup in inflationari pressur  my busi contact report that  while mani of the recent commod price increas will stick  other will not   energi price have come back down from their high  as have some other commod price   in some case the raw materi price increas can be pass along the suppli chain  but a lot of my contact still say that other cannot   and unit labor cost have not been rise  so  in general  busi person do not talk as though they are expect ani worsen in the inflat climat from where we are today  i think there are good reason to expect that we can keep the trend core pce in a rang close to    percent for the next sever year  if we get monetari polici back toward neutral within a reason period of  e   at the moment  i think the inflat risk face us have shift from a balanc posit toward an environ in which inflat could gradual creep up over  e if we aren   t vigil   but i will feel less anxious about this imbal of risk if we move the fed fund rate up today and continu to do so for a while  at a pace in tandem with the expans and consist with get polici back toward neutral   thank you  mr  chairman
mr  chairman  the tenth district economi has continu to expand at a veri solid pace sinc the last meet   the labor market show substanti sign of improv  the district   s employ rose in may  and i think the number in june are also veri strong  and job are abov year ago level in all seven of our state   manufactur activ rose in may  and the preliminari number come in for june are veri solid   product and new order continu to increas  and most plant manag that we talk with report that their rate of capac util were back to pre recess level   expect are that activ dure the second half of the year is like to cool somewhat but will still be at histor level   year over year product and new   order index actual are set new high in our region as we move through june   consum spend continu to rise at a moder pace   retail report steadi gain in sale  and we are op ist about the summer outlook   hous activ also remain strong   so far  home sale and homebuild have shown littl advers effect from the increas in mortgag rate we   ve seen to date   energi activ has continu to expand in respons to the high oil and gas price  and actual some drill has been constrain becaus of the shortag of labor in that particular sector  commerci real estat  as other have report  remain our weak spot as well  on the inflat front  wage pressur remain constrain in the region  but manufactur are continu to rais output price in respons to what they say are higher energi and raw materi cost that they feel they need to pass on   most manufactur do expect these cost to moder  howev  mani of them are now tell us that the strong demand has made it easier for them to increas price and to have the increas hold  turn to the nation outlook  the economi obvious continu to expand at a solid pace  we expect that gdp growth will be around    percent this year and just slight below   percent next year   the import point  i think  is that the continu strong growth larg reflect the fact that we have an accommod monetari polici and a s ul fiscal polici and that strong growth around the world is facilit growth in our gdp   the slowdown in growth that we   re project for next year is relat  of cours  to some back off in fiscal polici and a presum tighten in monetari polici  let me talk a bit about inflat   core inflat  as we all know  has increas   although we talk about import transitori element to that increas  i still think that the core price index now have embed in them some inflationari updrift that is due to our earlier accommod monetari polici   and while fiscal polici may back off  it is still go to be s ul  and we are   go to be in an accommod polici stanc for some  e   so as i think about polici go forward  i would join those who encourag us to have in mind move back toward neutral at a more deliber pace and in a veri systemat fashion   we should move to neutral more quick and avoid have to go abov neutral later to contain inflat  which i think is now threaten in light of our easi polici in the past   as far as the statement is concern  i think we should be veri spare with our word regard our like futur polici cours   i   d let the economi defin what our futur polici will be and not our word today   thank you

it took me a while to figur out how to address you   laughter
the twelfth district economi gain momentum in recent month and is expand in line with the nation   consum spend rose smart  and our contact report that price discount for a varieti of small retail item has declin as demand has grown   district hous market saw strong price appreci and strong sale   some of the sale activ  howev  appear to be a respons to anticip mortgag rate increas  suggest that market will calm down again in subsequ month   we are also see a continu general recoveri in the manufactur sector as rapid growth in export  especi to east asia  has propel strong gain in overal output and sale  job growth has also gain momentum in the west   especi outsid california  which has lag a bit in recent month   as a result  employ in some area report that it is get   harder to find qualifi applic for job open   the mountain region in particular has seen a larg increas in job vacanc rate over the past year and a half  and this has been associ with a pickup in the growth of labor compens relat to the nation   in fact  growth in compens recent has been near a percentag point higher in the west than in the nation   such diverg have occur befor  becaus of region labor demand shock  and have disappear as worker move into the region to fill those job   labor compens in the west then return toward the nation pace   at this point  it is too earli to tell whether the recent pickup is transitori  due main to such a region demand shock  or is the lead edg of a trend that will spread more broad in the nation economi  turn to the nation economi  our view about the outlook are pretti much in line with the  book   recent data suggest that econom growth in the second half of the year will be reason strong  and the most like outcom over the next coupl of year seem to be that the pace of growth will exceed potenti  bring the economi gradual back toward full employ  what is new about the outlook compar with may is the strong employ growth report for april and may  which rais confid that consum spend will remain strong enough  as fiscal s ulus wane  to support the veri desir project for econom activ and inflat that are outlin in the  book   of cours  to keep output from overshoot potenti  polici will need to tighten  given it current high accommod stanc   we think a path of the fund rate reason close to that current embodi in the fed fund futur will be appropri given what we now know   such a path easili qualifi as measur   of cours  our view will evolv with unfold data  in term of the inflat outlook  i agre that rather substanti risk remain on both the upsid and also the downsid   on the upsid  there is the possibl that the role of transitori   factor   as oppos to movement in compens and product   in explain the surpris recent uptick in core inflat is overes  by the  book   the uptick in core inflat could also affect futur wage bargain   the dollar could fall further  and oil price could jump or remain elev   we have also seen a small uptick in compens growth  although my read of the labor market is that there remain a signific amount of slack   final  not emphas in today   s present  there is upsid potenti for inflat if trend product growth fall short of the rather robust rate that i believ is built into the  book forecast  howev  there are also a number of downsid risk to inflat  as the  book and the present this morn emphas   one that   emphas has been particular import to us in our analysi   name  that profit margin have been extraordinarili larg and the markup of good price over unit labor cost in level term has risen to a new high   this larg markup could return to more normal level through fall inflat or through fa  growth in labor compens or a combin of the two   we saw such a run up and rapid revers toward normal dure the second half of the     s   base on our analysi  which is similar to an altern simul report in the  book  it is quit possibl that  if price and wage adjust consist with standard model equat over the next year and a half  the restraint on inflat could be quit signific   in ani event  the most like scenario appear to be that core pce price will increas by a littl over     percent this year and around     percent in        i see the risk to this forecast as be rather larg  but also the inflat risk seem rough balanc
the econom expans in the eleventh district start later and has been somewhat slower than the u s  expans  but remark from our director  beig book contact    and other suggest that the gap is close fast   the director report from our various board meet in the past few month have been consider more upbeat  rather than dwell on the up and down of differ sector of our region economi  i   d like to focus on the emerg psycholog of price power   one of our director from houston note that oper rate in petrochem have been increas across the board  and in a few of his product line these oper rate are approach their capac limit   he also mention that he was amaz at how fast the turnaround had occur   he then went on to say that his compani had rais it price twice in the month sinc the prior board meet and had encount littl resist   in fact  he mention that his custom express surpris that the price increas weren   t bigger   he ad that their resist to price increas was minim becaus they are confid that they can pass those increas along to their custom  i am relat this anecdot becaus i think it is symptomat of the reduc slack we hear about from an increas number of contact   mani of these busi keep close tab on capac util not onli in their industri but in those of their supplier as well   the sens that they are convey is one of concern that the feder reserv   s capac util data may be overst the degre of unus capac   in particular  mani of them have mention technolog obsolet plant and equip that may not be brought back on stream   one of our director from the high tech area report the result of a survey of chief inform offic   they indic a chang outlook for their technolog spend in the come year   over the last two year  spend on basic infrastructur  such as maintain their comput network  was immun to the econom downturn and account for    to    percent of their budget   as busi has been expand in recent month  this situat has begun to chang signific   in the second half of the year  they are look for infrastructur spend to compos onli about    percent of their budget  with the   remain    percent go for new applic and emerg technolog   he feel this is quit bullish  as the criterion for invest decis shift from    what is the payback period     to    what do we have to do to stay competit      this shift in attitud may reflect the realiz that the recent return to improv price power will prove to be a short live phenomenon and that boost product and effect capac is the way to deal with the grow demand  as i look at the nation economi  i find myself in general align with much of the chang and the broad contour of the staff forecast for this year   when i sent in my project last januari  i thought there was a reason probabl that we would end      with lower inflat than we had at the begin of the year   what a differ six month can make   my inflat project for this year is somewhat higher than the  book   s and for next year it is consider higher   the differ probabl reflect my relianc on anecdot inform and stori about capac constraint and the implic for the overal amount of slack resourc in the economi  one of our economist tri to simul what the feder reserv   s capac util rate for manufactur would look like if it incorpor the util number from the ism survey  while they are admit differ seri and differ concept of capac util  the simul   suggest that the fed   s measur may be on the low side by sever percentag point  even if the true number lie somewher in the middl  it would underscor the anecdot we   re hear about how fast excess capac is disappear   as for the main risk to the econom outlook over the next year and a half  i feel the staff cover them pretti well in their choic of altern simul scenario   from my point of view  the main risk involv some combin of the    less room to grow        higher inflat expect     and    surg demand    scenario   the polici implic of this combin of risk   and the baselin forecast as well   are pretti clear    as i indic at our may meet  i believ that the inflat risk are unambigu on the upsid and that we are behind the curv   given recent inflat data  we would have to rais the fund rate by at least    point just to avoid increas the amount of polici accommod we are alreadi provid   howev  we are commit to a measur step of   point today   but we do need to acknowledg the unbalanc upsid risk to inflat and drop the term    measur    in order to reclaim some flexibl go forward

thank you  mr  chairman   the expans in the ninth district is broad base   it has acceler recent  and we   re hear scatter report of labor avail issu in select locat   with the improv in employ  convers and concern about offshor outsourc have diminish  as one would expect   among the sector that are strong are manufactur  mine  energi  and agricultur   hous construct remain a sourc of strength as well  although the inventori of unsold home appear to be build in some major locat  and nonresidenti construct is start to improv  albeit off a low base   consum spend was strong earlier in the spring   recent report have been more mix  and that has been attribut essenti to lousi weather   we will see whether or not that in fact turn out to be the case as we get addit inform   as far as price are concern  report are continu to come in about both current and prospect price increas   clear  as i   ve said befor  there   s more go on there than i had anticip earlier  as far as the nation economi is concern  like almost everybodi els i think the outlook for growth in the nation economi is unquestion favor   my own forecast is for modest higher real growth both this year and next than in the staff forecast   the differ aren   t larg   it seem to me that the fundament for growth are clear posit   mayb equal import or   even more so  earlier uncertainti about employ gain have diminish  as have earlier uncertainti about the global recoveri  i do expect inflat to remain low  but not as low as i previous anticip   and i do think there is an obvious danger in attribut the acceler we   ve seen in inflat to temporari or one off factor   in ani event  given the confid interv that were present in the chart show and in the  book  it  sn   t seem to me to be a stretch to expect core inflat to be   percent this year and even a bit higher next year
thank you  mr  chairman  i   m go to talk primarili about convers i   ve had with those on my standard list of contact   my wal mart contact said that june sale had come in a bit weaker than anticip  which i think was wide report in the press   his es  for sale growth in june is now in the   to   percent rang  and the compani had been expect   to   percent   he attribut the weak in june as due primarili to cool weather in mani part of the countri  which has reduc sale of season suppli like air condition and that kind of thing  wal mart   s es  for sale growth go forward is   to   percent   my wal mart contact report to me result from a recent gallup poll of consum attitud that i think wal mart commiss gallup to do on a regular basi   number   on the list of concern was rise gasolin price  cite by    percent of the sampl   number       and   were health care  the general economi  and fear of war   number   was unemploy   fear of job loss   with the portion of respond mention that down to onli    percent of the sampl compar with    percent a coupl of month ago   that was quit a dramat chang in attitud on that issu   he also said that general merchandis price are still fall slight but less rapid than in the past  the buyer believ that most price increas for this year are alreadi in place   the figur i mention earlier   were for same store sale  wal mart continu with expans plan to add about   percent per year in squar footag  which is unchang from earlier expect   that mean that their hire plan reflect about   percent employ growth for the compani   my contact note that they have had no problem find sale associ   about    percent of their labor forc is full  e  wherea it   s usual about    percent   the consequ of veri low turnov in their labor forc   so labor suppli is plenti  as for the transport industri  my contact at fedex said that his firm has veri strong earn      incred strong    was the term he use   fedex is project a    percent increas in earn for fiscal        which end on may           over fiscal         he attribut about one half of the increas in earn to gain in volum  about one quarter to price  and one quarter to cost manag and product   fedex busi outbound from asia to the rest of the world is up at an    percent rate in the fiscal quarter end may      that   s on a year over year basi   while outbound traffic from the unit state is up   percent   that   s quit a dramat chang becaus u s  outbound shipment had been veri  veri low   u s  ground busi is up about    percent  fed ex has seen a substanti increas in it freight busi  which is less than it truckload shipment   my contact said that demand is incred high and it   s basic across the board   includ retail and manufactur part that are go into the product chain   and across the board geograph   fedex is oper at capac in it freight busi and will be increas it capit expenditur by    to    percent in fiscal year       over fiscal year         onli about    percent of that is replac invest  and the rest is capac expans   i think the expans will improv growth in the express busi   the high price busi  which had been lag becaus it was be replac by ground shipment   fedex is anticip growth in the express compon of it busi   that grew   percent in the last quarter  which was the highest   growth they   ve seen in five year   the compani is expect to add capac in the unit state to handl the rapid growth in intern busi   my contact note that traffic exit china was up    percent in the last year  and he see veri strong momentum to growth there   he has heard report of inconsist rail servic   appar one of the reason some shipment are be divert to air deliveri is becaus of problem in the rail network  my up contact said that the economi is chang      shift into higher gear    is the way he put it   outbound asia volum is exceed expect   busi in europ is not as strong but is also exceed expect  as is u s  traffic  both inbound and outbound   he describ volum as well abov expect everywher   he said that the express busi  both for household and busi  is strong   he indic that the growth in busi demand for express may reflect the veri lean inventori situat   he report that intern capac is veri tight   up is replac smaller aircraft with larger one   he said that they are in negoti with the pilot    union  appar the contract expir in decemb  and they   re in mediat   the pilot are ask for a    percent first year pay increas  and up is offer   percent   so they   re pretti far apart   my up contact also indic that they are anticip some problem in obtain part  e worker in the veri busi fourth quarter period   and they are expect a veri larg turnov in their labor forc in the next five year due to retir of pilot and mechan   to give you an idea about their expect for volum in the high demand fourth quarter period  they are expect to leas twenti nine aircraft just for that period compar with thirteen last year  my contact in the truck industri  from j b  hunt  said that he view the economi as not hot but warm   busi has been up and down   he didn   t quit understand some of the fluctuat  but a notic improv realli took hold in the late fall   he said that hunt truck volum in the intermod busi   that   s the piggyback rail busi   was up    to      percent from april to may   he indic that some of that might have been relat to problem with union pacif   the railroad report to him that they had misjudg the strength of the economi and were short in manpow and equip  and they believ it will take the rest of this year for them to catch up   he also report that csx has had servic problem   price is pretti strong on the truck side   price are up about   percent year over year  and mayb   percentag point of that is fuel surcharg   also  the suppli of driver is extrem tight  a wall street contact said that he believ the general view on wall street is that the fed has gotten behind the curv and will be look veri care at the inflat report go forward  as for my view of the nation economi  i think there is a veri solid upward momentum to real activ   it appear to me that transport demand has taken a lot of the compani by surpris   that   s my interpret   on inflat  my best guess is a modest increas of a few tenth rather than the modest decreas project by the staff   in term of point es   that probabl repres half a standard deviat   so the project are not veri far apart   probabl half a standard error apart   in term of the accuraci of the forecast   but i also believ that the inflat risk are quit substanti skew to the upsid over the next few quarter   and i would note that what   s go to happen in the next few quarter is larg independ of ani current polici decis  both at this meet and in august   i think we   re more like to have upsid surpris on inflat  and that   s a risk to us   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   the econom expans in our southeast region remain solid   recent develop in retail sale  auto  hous  tourism  travel  bank  and manufactur have all been posit  and i will not go through a discuss of each individu sector   the main weak remain in nonresidenti construct and chemic    most relev to our polici discuss this  e has been the emerg of imbal in certain sector that are generat signific price increas   for exampl  shortag of steel and cement  as well as rise price in other build materi  are clear affect big project in florida where bid are either be revis up or in some case builder are walk away from project   the price of concret is up    percent  with addit increas expect to come   at a breakfast meet last week  the develop of a larg high rise downtown atlanta residenti project told me that the job he had price last fall now look to be come in at a cost almost    percent higher becaus of rise price of various construct materi   we heard report of wholesal  contractor  and machin tool compani stock up on concret  steel  plywood  and sheetrock  if the materi are avail  in order to avoid futur price increas and potenti shortag   one florida contractor report hold a three month inventori of steel to limit the effect of higher futur cost   a shortag of truck driver becaus of both higher demand for transport and new driver regul is not onli increas ship cost but also report caus some firm to begin to carri larger inventori than previous  i   m get more and more report of the abil to pass through higher input price to final consum   let me cite just a few exampl   i   ve heard numer report of compani impos fuel surcharg without custom complaint   those report have come from up  a wast manag compani  a concret compani in south florida  a nurseri  an agricultur food and suppli compani  a trailer manufactur in tennesse  an auto seat manufactur in alabama  a lumber compani in florida  and numer small truck and deliveri compani   a box manufactur indic that he had pass along a sever    percent increas in paper price with littl resist  and he   s set to rais price again in septemb   in florida  small groceri store  hotel  and restaur report rais price without resist in light of strong demand and higher   food and energi input price   tennesse hotel and resort are also rais price for the first  e in year becaus of strong demand   fast food compani are report chicken suppli problem becaus of the truck shortag i mention previous   suppli problem coupl with increas demand in retail poultri market have report led some groceri store to tell their poultri supplier to    name their price      final  mani person servic firm   barber  spas  et cetera   in florida are rais price with littl resist   at the same  e  it is import to note that we also have mani other report of firm absorb input price increas becaus of competit  weak demand  or the hope that mani of the increas will prove to be transitori   nevertheless  over the last sever month  there have been far more stori of price increas and higher cost that are be pass along than we have heard in mani year  at the nation level  i think we have to be pleas and reassur with the new real side data  which have been quit posit overal   and as one of the earlier skeptic about the likelihood of robust near term job growth  i find the two strong employ report sinc our last meet to be realli good news   the  book as well as other forecast are suggest that gdp growth will be in excess of   percent in       with inflat stabil in      to a rate below that of       the distinguish factor between the  book and mani other forecast is that few of the latter have the  book   s particular combin of reason strong real gdp growth  benign inflat  and low unemploy togeth with a low path for the feder fund rate   if the  book forecast are seen by the committe as adequ repres our belief about the futur  then are we in fact forecast that the economi will soon return to the path it was on in the late     s   perhap   but i see the under fundament as be differ this  e  and differ enough to suggest that the longer term inflat risk may be higher than some believ    i suggest at our last meet that our focus should be on the best path for futur polici and not just on the first rate increas   i   ve been anxious  and still am  to get start with an earli process of remov the extraordinari polici accommod that is no longer need   recent inflat and inflat expect data   and the anecdot report we   ve share this morn   seem to underscor the need to get start with our polici adjust  even allow for the fact that some portion of the price increas we   re see will turn out to be transitori   my concern about the futur path of polici has been reinforc by our discuss ye day afternoon about the under imbal of the so call twin deficit that we are now experienc   this heighten my belief that we may well find that we will need to be on a steeper rate path than we have been see in mani of our simul   specif  what are some of the more troublesom under fundament i   m talk about   consum debt and household financi oblig  while a bit off their peak level  are still much greater than in the     s   and the govern fiscal situat now show deficit that are larger and like to continu to grow  especi sinc i don   t see either tax or spend polici move to correct them in the near futur   final  as we discuss ye day  we have a grow and unsustain current account deficit  these factor point to higher level of consumpt and aggreg demand and suggest that a neutral fund rate may be somewhat higher than some project  especi at the present rate of product   if i am correct  then we run the risk of pursu a more accommod monetari polici than we intend  with the like outcom be a higher rate of inflat than expect  there   s a temptat to downplay the risk i   m rais   after all  the u s  economi has function quit well with low inflat rate and with a negat real short term rate  and some see continu resourc slack as take pressur off price   but i suggest  given the recent combin of expans fiscal and monetari polici  that our low inflat rate is most like the consequ of   heavi support for the dollar provid from abroad and a willing on the part of foreign to invest in this countri  compens for the low u s  save rate  histori  as well as theori  suggest that larg current account deficit should be self correct through downward adjust in our exchang rate  upward adjust to real interest rate  a reduct in domest consumpt relat to product  and an increas in privat and public save   all of this was discuss ye day   what i think make the order transit of this imbal especi difficult and problemat is the postur of current u s  fiscal polici  which is not orient toward reel in the deficit  combin with the trade and exchang rate polici of other countri   china and japan to name just two   these countri are pursu polici they perceiv to be in their own short term interest   that is  they are either run persist current account surplus or maintain an overvalu currenc through currenc intervent aim at fix their exchang rate relat to the dollar   while this may help fo  domest growth in those countri  it also has the effect of enabl riski fiscal behavior on the part of the unit state  while postpon the day of reckon for all  obvious  the feder reserv can   t deal with trade or foreign exchang polici  nor can we engin a return to a more sustain world economi by ourselv   in this respect  the conduct of monetari polici becom more difficult   what i believ we can and should do is to move the path of monetari polici back toward a more neutral posit   and the sooner we begin and actual get there  the lower the adjust cost will be for the unit state and for the rest of the world   if we wait too long befor act  then the more aggress path we would have to pursu to catch up carri increas risk  given the leverag in the consum sector   moreov  by fall behind the curv we risk the likelihood of addit pressur on the dollar  contribut even more to intern imbal   final  like presid    i am more comfort with the fund rate   path embed in financi market than i am with the more modest adjust reflect in the  book baselin  and like sever other  i hope we can find languag for our statement that unti our hand to do what is suggest by develop as they unfold   thank you  mr  chairman
in the fifth district  the econom recoveri appear to have strengthen in may and earli june   manufactur activ continu to expand  although the pace has lessen in recent week   shipment and new order are up  and there are spot report of increas export demand in europ and china  particular for some nich technolog product   despit the slower pace of output growth  employ in manufactur has increas on net in maryland  virginia  and south  ina but continu to fall in north  ina  with it heavi concentr of textil  apparel  and furnitur plant   for the district as a whole  i get the sens that manufactur employ is expand even more slowli than in the nation  outsid of manufactur  howev  hire is definit pick up   in fact  sever of our contact are report sign of emerg tight in labor market  consist with these report  our diffus index for district manufactur wage pick up sharpli this month   our survey report also indic that the pace of materi price increas eas somewhat in may and june  although firm continu to complain about higher price for select commod such as steel and concret  retail are report moder higher revenu  but they say that sale growth in earli june has slip a bit from may   s pace   elsewher across the servic sector  howev  revenu growth seem to have acceler in recent week   commerci realtor have report a moder uptick in retail leas activ recent  but offic and industri leas remain sluggish overal    residenti construct is still quit strong in our district  and now we are get consist report of strong commerci loan demand  consist with the evid from the fifth district  the recoveri of the nation economi appear to be deepen and broaden  particular in busi spend and hire   i think we have everi reason to expect to maintain this traction and to see a well balanc expans take hold in the quarter ahead   the  book project real gdp to grow at around   percent for the remaind of       and to slow to the rate of potenti growth thereaft  close the es  output gap by earli         this project seem quit reason to me  headlin inflat has been run higher than we would like over the last coupl of month  but for sever reason it seem plausibl that this recent increas will turn out to be transitori   the output gap is still sizabl   the markup of price over unit labor cost  as we discuss earlier  is well abov it long run averag  and given that  it seem most like to declin  inflat expect seem to be reason well anchor   moreov  year over year increas in measur consum inflat are still moder   for exampl  core pce inflat on a year over year basi remain insid the   percent to   percent rang consist with price stabil   on the other hand  short run inflat expect have move up in recent month togeth with actual inflat  and financi market measur of inflat compens at longer horizon have drift higher as well   moreov  as the  book note  market base inflat expect appear to be sensit to declar of the fomc   s resolv to hold the line on inflat   the fact that the path of the fed fund rate expect by market particip exceed the baselin path assum in the  book can be interpret  as i read it  as evid that financi market continu to be nervous about upsid inflationari risk   the market   s reaction to monday   s inflat figur bol  that notion  i think    all in all  though  i think we posit ourselv reason well come into this meet  the labor market recoveri is on track  inflat seem like to moder in the near term  and market expect us to move interest rate higher at a fair healthi clip   i think the main challeng for monetari polici in come month will be gaug the speed with which we need to increas interest rate to hold the line on inflat
thank you  mr  chairman   develop sinc our last meet support a reason degre of confid in the strength of the expans and somewhat more concern about the outlook for inflat   the economi of the second district seem to have strengthen further   employ is grow veri rapid  and retail sale have been strong even in the face of the softer nation number   our survey of manufactur show persist strong read  with even more op  six month out   credit demand seem to be grow   core inflat in the region has fallen off a bit but remain well abov the nation averag   the anecdot stori in the district suggest a continu abil to pass on cost increas and grow pressur to rais compens to attract and retain worker with the requisit skill  at the nation level  we think the fundament support continu strength in demand growth at a comfort  if somewhat softer  rate   high level of report consum confid  strong incom growth  and more rapid gain in employ should support reason healthi growth in consumpt   invest seem like to have ampl reason and room to continu to grow at a rapid rate  with corpor balanc sheet strong  profit margin strong  inventori low  and order run high   we think foreign demand look pretti posit  too  but not strong enough to avoid a signific negat contribut from net export this year and next    on the assumpt that monetari polici rough track the present path of market expect  we project gdp growth of about     percent in real term this year and somewhat under   percent in         we see the risk to this path as balanc  with the princip downsid risk come from the strateg realm rather than the econom   strateg in term of a terrorist event or a major oil suppli shock   on the econom side  the princip risk seem like to come from a more substanti slowdown in household spend  a sharp reduct in near term or expect product growth  or a sharp declin in the willing of nonresid to acquir u s  financi asset  we are somewhat more concern about the inflat outlook   we have now seen signific acceler in under inflat to a level somewhat abov our rang of comfort   we face some risk that a modest increas in inflat expect   even after the recent moder of those expect   will feed through to higher compens growth   the extent of the swing in unit labor cost  the various indic of supplier delay despit high report capac number  and the persist report of price power all suggest a pattern of inflat dynam that is hard to reconcil with the degre of slack we thought we had perceiv in the economi  so we have rais our inflat forecast for core pce a bit to    percent for        with a somewhat lower rate in         it stay below   percent in part becaus we still assum a reason substanti monetari polici respons that is effect in contain expect  in part becaus we believ oil and commod price will start to bring down the headlin number  and in part becaus we still think product growth is go to be reason high   all those factor  combin with high profit margin  strong competit pressur  and an expect gradual pace in the absorpt of remain slack in the labor market  work to contain inflat go forward   but we think the risk to that forecast may be somewhat to the upsid   or if we want to say the risk are balanc  we   think they are balanc around a higher path for under inflat and a higher bulg in the near term  the uncertainti in the outlook reinforc the case for underscor our commit to do what is necessari to contain the risk to our object of price stabil   the cost of be perceiv as too complac about under inflat probabl are now greater to us than the altern   now that we   ve reach the point where we need to begin to move to a more neutral fed fund rate  we take some comfort from the fact that financi market seem reason well prepar for the begin of this transit   the thing we can measur as well as the anecdot report from a broad rang of financi intermediari suggest  as the board staff now conclud  that the anticip chang in the fed fund rate will not caus a lot of collater damag or be accompani by a lot of volatil amplifi posit adjust and hedg   but there   s a lot we cannot measur and cannot know about how the world will react to the initi of what will have to be a substanti increas in the fed fund rate over  e  after a veri long period of low rate  and we   re like to encount some surpris even if they are not system in their magnitud  we are reason comfort with the extent of the tighten that is now price in  and we are pleas with how respons those expect have been both to the stronger data and the higher inflat number   howev  the path of expect still suggest a reason high degre of confid that we will move in onli    basi point increment   i don   t think we can be fulli confid that we can afford that gentl a path   our signal should aim to qualifi further the qualif we have gradual introduc over the past few meet and to emphas that we will act as necessari to keep expect inflat low   we don   t need to tri to induc a signific steeper path for the fed fund rate right now  but it probabl would be help if the market built in a   somewhat greater expect that we could move in larger increment this year if circumst warrant   thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   my forecast  like most of your  repres quit a nice outcom for the economi   i have growth somewhat abov the growth of potenti  so the output gap close fair gradual  with the economi reach full util in the latter part of      and core pce inflat remain below   percent   all this is accomplish in my forecast with an assum measur pace of tighten   like presid    i would includ someth on the order of what is built into the market as measur  i am expect both slower growth and higher inflat this year than in my januari project   a number of develop have contribut to this less favor configur  but most promin among them have been higher price for energi and other import good and commod   these have had the classic effect of an advers price shock  damp growth and rais price   these price increas seem to account for a good portion of the pickup in core inflat   and the effect on spendabl incom of the rise cost of oil and other import with low short run demand elast probabl has kept demand for domest produc good and servic from grow as rapid as it otherwis would   in part  my relat sanguin outlook from here reflect my expect that these shock won   t be repeat and could even be revers to a degre   oil and commod price have come off their high  as demand from china has cool and consum and produc have begun to adjust product and consumpt to the higher price   as the price shock effect erod  polici s ulus should show through more to the growth of demand  and inflat should abat   next year  the  e eros of fiscal and financi s ulus help to slow growth  just as the economi approach full employ   and inflat should remain   contain  as continu though eb margin of slack along with elev profit margin keep market competit  someth is sure to go wrong   the interest question revolv around how fast the output gap is like to close   is there a danger of overshoot without consider near term polici restraint    and around inflat   even if slack disappear gradual  is stabl core inflat a reason expect  on the speed of closur of the output gap  recent inform seem to be send contradictori sign   anecdot   ism and other busi survey and what we   ve heard around the tabl today   portray an economi with a consider head of steam  this impress is reinforc by the larg increas in establish employ in recent month   strong ip and a substanti increas in capac util add to the impress that slack is disappear fair quick  but an array of other data have suggest a slower approach to high resourc util  in the household survey  the unemploy rate is unchang sinc januari  and labor forc particip hasn   t risen   moreov  the workweek  which one might anticip would strengthen concurr with or even befor hire  has bare budg off a veri low level   gdp itself is es  to have grown at a   percent rate over the first half of the year   a solid pace  as we say in our announc  but hard a barnburn when structur product is probabl still advanc rapid   this es  of   percent includ a level out of consumpt in recent month  along with a coupl of releas show weak order and shipment that highlight the solid rather than the ebulli charact of the expans  go forward  the risk around an expect of a fair gradual declin in slack appear to me to be rough balanc   in addit to the possibl of geopolit oil market develop damp demand  we can   t yet gaug how spend will respond to the recent rise in intermedi    and long term rate   to be sure  as i alreadi note  sever influenc were hold back the pace of expans this year  but   percent growth   onli moder abov the rate of growth of the economi   s potenti    sn   t seem all that strong  given the unusu degre of fiscal and financi s ulus in the latter part of      and earli        financi condit remain support of abov trend growth  but they have tighten in recent month as market have come to anticip our action   household spend would seem to be the most vulner   the high level of household spend encourag by low interest rate over recent year must have borrow to some extent from futur expenditur  on the upsid  there is some risk that spread op   especi among busi  could overwhelm the gradual eros of fiscal and monetari accommod   with an assum measur pace of monetari tighten  neither polici turn restrict next year   it could be that more of the strength in invest this year is attribut to under demand and less to the anticip of the expir of partial expens at the end of the year   in this case  we could see more strength in invest persist through earli next year than would be consist with an appreci moder in growth  in contrast to my view on the eros of the output gap  i suspect  along with mani of you  that the risk around my forecast that core inflat will remain below   percent are not quit balanc   to be sure  the weight of the experi of recent year suggest to me that     or     percent is abov the nairu and that      percent is below the sustain oper rate of manufactur   i do not believ that the rate of obsolesc of human or physic capit has acceler so much that this experi is no longer pertin  moreov  as i note  much of the pickup in core inflat this year seem to be explain by one  e price level adjust  and long term inflat expect realli haven   t move   much  on balanc  even as short term expect rose substanti   still  there is much we do not understand about the inflat process  as   was care to point out this morn   and the pickup in core inflat has been a surpris to me   the output gap is an unobserv construct    infer from the behavior of other variabl like price and compens   with consider imprecis   and the extent of the slack in the staff forecast isn   t that larg   henc we need to watch the inflat data care  and until i see some evid that confirm my expect that the recent rate of increas of core cpi and pce inflat will stabil and even moder at least a littl  the risk would seem to be on the side of higher inflat than my forecast  my prefer for the next part of this meet would be not onli to remov some of the accommod of polici but also to find the combin of word that reflect both the central tendenc of expect of a measur pace of polici tighten and the recognit that  in these circumst  the committe must be alert to the possibl that it could need to take more decis action   if the committe agre that a    measur pace    of polici tighten is the most like outcom  i think inclus of these word in our announc   convey use inform   with that languag in place over the last few month  reaction in financi market to incom data have been substanti and sensibl   i do not think that market are interpret    measur pace    as an uncondit commit   retent of this languag along with a statement underlin our commit to do what is necessari to maintain price stabil would not materi  in my view  constrain our action in the futur   if we do omit refer to a measur pace  we will need to rethink the balanc of risk sentenc   if we keep it present configur or the suggest configur in which the risk are balanc for both output and inflat  stand alon  that convey essenti noth about the committe   s concern and it intent   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   i read from the poll and the market survey that it is a    slam dunk    or  to use anoth analog that has been in the news late  a    gimm putt    that the fed will start rais rate at this meet   that issu seem hard worth discuss   what is on everybodi   s mind is how fast and how far rate will rise and whether the fed is behind the curv  for all the market chatter that the fed is behind the curv  i frank find it surpris hard to see much support macro evid   start with the model  the  book has the fund rate increas by   percentag point over the next six quarter  a move of rough    basi point in two third of our meet over the period   this pace is distinct below what almost everi market comment is talk about and below the fed fund futur curv  and it still leav the fund rate well below equilibrium at the end of        i would have thought that such an approach would be too littl  too late  and would let inflat start increas   in fact  at least in the model  it conform remark well with what the bluebook call a    perfect foresight    path  under which the long run inflat and unemploy outlook conform quit close to my normat target   by this standard  at ani rate  the fed  sn   t seem to be behind the curv   but those are just model  broad speak  there are two relationship that could go awri in these simul   the first involv what is be call the pass through issu   whatev the overal rate of util  becaus exogen price or expect have increas  inflat could rise   at least for a  e  what exogen price   one is commod price  but these have been shown to have a small effect on overal price and have alreadi start turn down   anoth is oil price   while there is still signific uncertainti about the middl east  the staff has made a calcul that even remov the entir iraqi oil output from the market would rais overal core pce inflat onli a   few tenth of a percent   moreov  the staff   s demand   suppli analysi make it as like that oil price and futur price will fall as rise   non opec oil suppli has turn out to be increas fa  than demand  and inde  oil price have back off recent   a third is the dollar  which of cours we discuss extens ye day   there   s not much more to be said about that except that in a lot of scenario that adjust  sn   t come with a whole lot of inflationari potenti for the economi   as for inflationari expect  the short term measur have inde risen  but slight  howev  as has been note by sever peopl  price markup are also veri high  and they could put downward pressur on overal price   at a  e with as much uncertainti as now  it is alway possibl that inflat will rise through this pass through channel  but a care look at the evid actual lead me to have substanti doubt about that  the other possibl for a rise in inflat involv the fact that output gap may not be as larg as the staff think   of cours  they may not be  but to me there is plenti of evid that the present     percent rate of employ   not repres full capac economywid   first  of cours  i can rememb a few year ago when the unemploy rate went to   percent with no real hint of acceler in inflat   second  employ as measur by the employ survey is still well below it peak  and as don just note  labor forc particip is low  and the workweek is still veri low   wage have increas a bit but have not realli acceler   and unit labor cost are still low  though pick up a bit   the whole pictur   not look to me like one of overful macroeconom capac  and i still find myself reason comfort with a nairu in the neighborhood of   percent  consid the pass through channel and the output channel togeth  somewhat to my surpris the inflat risk realli do seem somewhat balanc to me   this is  of cours  exact what the fomc has been say for a  e now   as kissing onc said     the statement has the   ad advantag that it actual seem to be true       laughter   as a best guess  i   m still comfort with the main strategi of a gradual increas in rate start now and at everi meet or so   but we do have to worri about more than best guess   as i said last  e  i   m still nervous on the upsid part becaus of the unhappi and haunt experi of the      s   the logic may have look as though inflat would not get out of control then either  but it did   so i still think we have to be readi to activ plan b   a more rapid rise in rate  which we can put into effect if futur data report and other indic start suggest that inflat realli   seem to be truli ramp up   such a plan b would alert the market now to the fact that  if we do seem to be fall behind the inflat curv  somehow or other the gradual pace will give way  and we   ll rais rate more rapid  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   dure the intermeet period i have been struck main by the surpris that have come in   unfortun  this  e around the surpris have been somewhat contradictori   we have alreadi had some discuss of what the downsid surpris have been  so let me tri to be fair brief   the first  obvious  was that first quarter real gdp growth was revis down about    percentag point   in addit  the new order and shipment data in may  while strong  were weaker than expect  and the staff has alreadi indic how that affect their think   more recent  consum spend  while also strong  was notic weaker than expect   and final  if one   a quick review of the  book over this year  it is clear that  for almost everi forecast round  the staff has been revis down it outlook for both      and       so  whi this litani of downsid surpris for the real economi   it is not becaus i doubt that the economi is on a self sustain growth path   i do not   other element of the economi   in   particular  strong job growth and consum confid   seem pois to provid the underpin for momentum in the economi   and perhap this short list of downsid surpris onli remind us that econom growth   not follow a smooth month or quarter pattern   howev  i must admit that this pattern of downsid surpris leav me with some concern that the path of the economi may be shallow than origin thought and perhap even somewhat below the growth rate of potenti   but  as i think don and ned both indic  the fact that the unemploy rate  the labor forc particip rate  and the capac util rate have all remain stubborn low or high   depend on how you think about it   suggest that  inde  we are not close the gap as rapid as some had fear   this recent soft and this shallow path out of      and into      are somewhat worrisom to me becaus they seem to be emerg just at a point when fiscal polici is fall back from notic s ul to slight contractionari   so in short  at least in comparison to the origin  book project  i put much more weight on the downsid possibl  and therefor i   m more comfort with the new forecast the staff present this morn  now obvious  on the other side of this surpris index  there have been surpris on the upsid with respect to inflat   i find these surpris not terribl troublesom in that i think we still are most like to end up be in what i would describ as the zone of price stabil   but i must admit that we   re probabl at the upper end of that zone at this stage   what is probabl more troubl about these surpris on inflat is that they are relat hard to explain   there are some who argu that the real surpris on inflat were so low last year that we are now just deal with the natur catch up   mani argu that the pass through for oil  commod price  and import price in general is higher than histor norm  though we saw ye day that some would argu that we are simpli return to the norm   final  some would use the upsid surpris in   inflat to argu that the most common held view of inflat dynam   name  that inflat pressur remain subdu as long as resourc are slack   is wrong   other look at the same set of data would argu that we realli don   t have a veri good understand of slack resourc or how larg the slack is in the economi   in ani event  while i think that inflat is not yet a press danger  we clear must consid for the first  e in a long  e an upsid risk as well as a downsid risk around our core or baselin forecast   these surpris also remind us how unfortun littl we know about inflat dynam  as i think the staff indic in their present   the model that we have on price level chang i think have an r  of somewher around     or      suggest that humil in this regard  as with other thing  is veri import  so veri briefli  recogn the  e  what are the implic of these surpris and uncertainti for monetari polici   as ned has alreadi indic  we   re obvious about to embark on a phase of tighten   that is an action i will fulli support   polici rate are clear too low for an economi that is grow as our obvious is   and as the economi normal  the polici rate should also normal   howev  given the uncertainti that i at least feel about the outlook for both price stabil and output stabil  i would encourag us to follow a veri pragmat path   i believ we should make as few chang as possibl in the general messag we have been send  while maintain our credibl and our commit to our mission   we should also continu to hold open the option that we can adjust our plan as incom data warrant on either side   forti year ago  barri goldwat made a comment that i   d like to use now      gradual in the face of uncertainti is no vice   undu hast in defens of credibl is no virtu       laughter

thank you  mr  chairman   econom growth is increas becom broad  base and  i believ  sustain   capit expenditur  whose curtail was the caus of the last recess  are strong   employ growth in the last sever month has realli come back to life  and manufactur is show real strength for the first  e  with rise capac util and employ growth for four consecut month   retail sale continu to grow solid   and inventori  while increas  continu to be well manag by compani as inventori   sale ratio drop to new low everi month  which should  in turn  support expans go forward  corpor profit are up over    percent in the last year  and forecast are for continu strong growth in        debt   equiti ratio for nonfinanci corpor continu to improv from their peak set in the third quarter of      and are now down to level last seen in the     s   our recent flow of fund data for      q  show a fourth straight quarter of a surplus fund gap for busi   thus  compani have the financi strength to fund continu expans intern and to access capit market and financi institut for fund on favor term  earlier  the chairman made a comment about the profit share of gdp versus gnp  and the staff     in particular   won   t be amaz that that is one of the number i tend to look at over  e   the profit share of the gdp number actual show a more extrem peak in profit share   it hit a seventi five year high of     percent of gdp in the first quarter  and that   s about     point abov the long run averag   profit share   tend to revert to the mean over  e   but what   that impli right now   we know that analyst look at individu compani forecast that earn per share for      will show a mark slowdown but still growth   and they are assum that compani will have to absorb more cost that are not pass through to custom into       histor  most profit margin reduct come through relat fa  growth of labor cost than price  and that is reflect in part in the recent revis we   ve seen in employe   compens cost in the fourth quarter of       and the first quarter of this year   product growth slow as the expans progress  and competit for worker intensifi as strong employ growth continu   those factor and increas compens to retain the best employe in more competit labor market will all like contribut to a larger share of incom go to labor   so i am less op ist on labor cost than the staff forecast  the various inflat measur releas sinc the last fomc meet show surpris strength   one of the few indic to improv  the core crude compon of the produc    price index  has now fallen for two month  but that   s after nine month of except increas   the core cpi eas a bit in may after three month of acceler  while one can point to unusu jump in price for item such as use car  apparel  or lodg  the list of these except is get broad enough to ask whether price power has return in a much wider sens   so i think this is a  e when we need to be especi attent to the incom inflat data and make sure we act prompt to limit further acceler
thank you  mr  chairman   i   d like to share with you     s rule of forecast  as propound by former fomc member and current sensationalist author  larri      laughter   rule    stick with your forecast as long as possibl   rule    when your forecast becom unten  make a new forecast   rule    know when to switch from rule   to rule     laughter  there   s noth much need in term of chang to our forecast for the real side of the economi  which has thus far evolv much as this committe predict in both june      and januari        the economi has come a long way in the past year  and as we contempl new challeng ahead  we should paus to take some satisfact in the feder reserv   s contribut to   the turnaround   our polici action  reinforc by innov in our communic strategi  help provid crucial support to the economi dure a danger period  as an asid  there has recent been a bit of revision to the effect that our concern with deflat a year ago were overst on the ground that the offici statist may have in some way exagger the true extent of disinfl   understand last year   s inflat behavior is import but in my view not realli relev to assess the extent of the polici challeng the fomc face in earli        the most salient fact about the first half of      was that the economi continu to sputter even as our polici rate declin to   percent   we thus face the real possibl  whether remot or not  that the fund rate would reach or come close to the zero lower bound  a develop that would have great complic our subsequ policymak   avoid those danger water on the way to robust econom growth was an import achiev inde  unlik the growth forecast  the inflat forecast is one to which     s rule of forecast may now appli   i certain did not anticip the pickup in inflat we have seen in the past few month  and i congratul my colleagu who were more astut than i in appreci the earli chang in the price environ   given what we have seen in the inflat data  the question now is whether the  e has come for me to switch from     s rule   to rule     i wish rule   would give more practic guidanc on this question    laughter   the key issu  of cours  is whether the recent increas in inflat portend further increas or whether it was instead at least part temporari   though suitabl chasten by my recent forecast miss  i guess i can   t help myself   i   m still inclin to the view that inflat  both headlin and core  is like to moder in the second half of the year   in particular  the stabil of energi price   oil price are now more than    percent off their peak   non energi commod price  and the dollar bode especi well for the inflat outlook  though it may be some month befor we see the full effect    in this respect  i find the decomposit of the recent increas in inflat provid to me by staff member charl fleischman and similar to the present this morn quit interest  between the second half of      and the first half of       core pce inflat increas by a full percentag point at an annual rate   of this increas      percentag point was account for by a rapid acceler in nonmarket price   i e   made up price  notabl the infam deflat for financi servic   with nonmarket price exclud  more than     percent of the acceler in core pce inflat between      h  and      h  can be account for by higher inflat or less deflat in good price  particular durabl good price   in contrast  the inflat in servic exclud energi  whether inclus of hous servic or not  has actual deceler in the past six month   as it seem like that good price would be relat more affect by chang in the valu of the dollar and in the price of energi and raw materi  this pattern seem consist with the infer that the recent increas in inflat is due more to these factor than to a general increas in aggreg demand or higher labor cost  for exampl  moder of inflat   requir that unit labor cost remain under control   labor suppli still seem quit elast   the fact that the recent addit of more than a million job has bare affect the unemploy rate suggest that mani peopl stand readi to enter the labor forc as condit improv   wage trend are more difficult to assess   compens per hour in the nonfarm busi sector increas at a     percent annual rate in the first quarter  more than we expect   howev  becaus total compens data includ such item as retrospect pension payment and the valu of exercis stock option  they may overst the true margin cost of labor   at the other extrem  averag hour earn of product worker  which exclud such item but also exclud other benefit cost such as health insur  rose onli     percent at an   annual rate in the first quarter   the true growth in margin cost is no doubt bracket by these two figur  all this said  it has been brought home to me by recent experi that inflat forecast as well as output forecast are  of cours  alway hazard and seem particular so today   know when to switch from     s rule   to rule   is not so easi   given these uncertainti  it seem to me that the best tactic for us at this junctur is to tempor  embark on a program of gradual rate increas but remain alert and readi to adjust in respons to incom inform  with respect to communic  i would simpli say that i am fair comfort with the configur of expect about futur tighten that is now built into the market   so if we do chang communic  i hope we will be care not to destabil those expect unduli  thank you
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for today  i survey three bank   a new york money center bank  a southea n region bank  and a nation bank with a midwest base and a twenti four state footprint   i came away with two strong reaction from those interview   the first had to do with asset qualiti   two of my three contact use phrase like    the best ever    and    get better      in their assess  asset qualiti exceed that suggest in     s chart show on both the consum and the busi side  and in my judgment it is at a level that also is better than what could be achiev simpli by the applic of good credit standard by bank  when i pursu this question  the banker suggest that it is an indic of manag disciplin   i think the same disciplin that sandi pianalto refer to  which we are see throughout the rest of the busi communiti  is evid also in borrow    move on to lend activ  for most of the past year the sens of the outlook that i   ve gotten from the bank industri has lag our forecast in term of the strength of the recoveri  we have been predict a recoveri for most of the last year  and yet there was a hesit by the banker to embrac that view  base on what they pick up in their interact with their borrow   their expect no longer lag our  for the first  e this year it seem to me that they have clear caught up  my have said that  to date the onli signific lend activ is in commerci real estat  and the bank that are involv in commerci real estat are those that reli on an interest rate spread in order to achiev their profit  so it   s the small region and the larg communiti bank   as suggest in the dialogu we had here between sue and   regard the potenti weak in that sector  i think develop there certain bear watch  c i lend is still soft for all the reason that we   ve talk about   liquid is strong  and product is strong   the partial expens that  on the one hand  is increas the incent for invest is also provid increas cash flow for debt servic  which is perhap postpon the need for borrow   take all thing into consider  howev  busi confid seem to have fulli recov   the partial expens will provid an addit incent for the second half of the year   and simpli base on the respons of my contact in the bank industri  it seem to me that there will clear be increas activ from the bank sector in the second half of       in term of where we are today  we have signal in our communic a sequenc of how we expect the recoveri to unfold   we talk about expect inflat to be quiescent for a consider period   we move from there to talk about the need for caution but patienc in the remov of polici accommod   then we indic that rate would like move up at a measur pace  and it seem to me that we have reach the point where we can begin that process    and i see littl reason to chang veri much in term of the manner in which we have anticip that event would unfold

tabl   of the bluebook base on member    comment to soften the character of incom inflat data and to trim the last sentenc for clariti   besid align the languag to the realiti of recent data releas  the word of altern b point out that polici remain accommod  even after polici action  in the rational paragraph   it also retain assess of balanc risk to your two object on the view that the outlook   not differ materi from that at the may meet  when you made a similar choic   also in the risk assess paragraph  the measur pace sentenc refer onli to inflat  not resourc slack  to align market expect

measur of flexibl   but depend on the data over the next six week  these word encompass a    or    basi point move at the august meet  and by delet them  you would lose the opportun to reassur market particip that your outlook is such that you like can tighten gradual and that you retain your inflat fight credenti   this rais a final topic that i embrac with all the enthusiasm associ with sisyphus when he determin the  e has come to begin roll that big rock up the hill onc more   name  i should point out a structur issu about your communic polici that may emerg in the next few meet   the risk assess paragraph provid the opportun to hint about the futur direct of interest rate   in the past few meet  the last ad sentenc has been suffici explicit about your intent   whether about a consider

which may not be that inform if they are left at balanc   one possibl would be to tilt the risk toward the upsid now  explain that  if the current degre of accommod were maintain over the next few quarter  growth could well exceed it sustain pace and inflat exceed that associ with price stabil   but the nuanc of the switch might well elud market particip  who as i have alreadi note expect the announc of balanc risk  the risk avers recommend on the risk assess is that  if it hide a few landmin that may prove troublesom in the futur  there may be  e to fix it after this meet  includ in the chairman   s semiannu tes oni next month   that conclud my prepar remark
question for     if not  let me start off by note that recent commentari   not onli the anecdot discuss around this tabl but also the report from our various beig book contact  director  and the like   have all point to an extraordinarili expans economi and to the emerg of under inflationari pressur   on the other hand  when we look at the basic data for the recent period  we see a seri of downward revis   this kind of dispar usual is not found in the same set of inform unless we season adjust the anecdot  and i   m not quit sure how one goe about do that   with regard to the data  the latest revis for gdp and new order have been down  initi claim have definit stop declin  and this morn we learn that the latest data on purchas origin from the mortgag banker associ fell fair signific   there is someth veri interest go on  and in  e we will figur out what it is   i am sure that our favorit ex member of the board of governor  in addit to his three rule that were mention earlier  has a fourth rule that will suggest how that is done  i think that the surpris  strang enough  are not in measur of inflat   the big surpris is in profit margin  they have surg at a pace we haven   t seen in more than twenti year  the arithmet of profit margin tell us someth veri interest   at the level of about    percent for nonfinanci corpor on a consolid basi  the arithmet essenti indic that a   percentag point increas in profit margin over a one year  e frame elev the rate of inflat by   percentag point if unit cost are flat   and  inde  if profit margin were to increas by   percentag point per quarter when overal unit cost are flat  we would end up with an addit   percentag point of inflat   in fact  start in       profit margin rose  on averag  close to   percentag point per quarter  fortun  this was part offset by a drop in overal labor and nonlabor unit cost   look at the month pattern that are implicit in the incom data for this   year  it appear that profit margin have been essenti unchang thus far through the month of may   what we are observ for the earli part of this year is a littl upward movement in unit cost and price increas that do not reflect further signific increas in margin  profit margin  as has been point out  are at the upper edg of the rang beyond which histor they have not tend to rise   the reason is larg that  if they were to rise further  the result would be to contraven the long term stabil of the ratio of profit to nation incom  inde  what we are begin to see  i suspect  is an effort to harvest these veri larg profit margin   in that regard  we are begin to get a signific expans in the util of labor and capit  the effect of which is to caus unit cost to move up   the way that appar is occur at this stage is larg through the effect on product  as we were discuss earlier  the compens of employe   not appear to have acceler materi  although it is unclear what the last coupl of month are show   it is fair evid that the real issu   not relat to structur product growth but to actual growth   what the data for april and may are suggest is a veri signific slow in product and  inde  a mark pickup in unit labor cost   unit nonlabor cost actual  if anyth  are reflect a general declin in fix cost as the economi   s expans spread fix cost over a wider base   so  what we are observ through the first five month of the year may be the begin of a shift from the fall overal unit cost observ last year to a pickup larg becaus actual product growth  which was grow at a pace well abov that of structur product  has moder  we are move from the behavior of inflat as wholli the consequ of rise product  and therefor rise profit margin to increas evid of stabil margin  with some evid that the stabil is be induc by some slow in product growth   in turn  unit labor cost are begin to move up   it now look as though increas in unit labor cost   are somewhat abov   percent  mayb between     and   percent at an annual rate in the most recent month or two  incident  the under inflat rate  use the market base core pce measur  is at an annual rate of     percent for april and may  and for the latest three month it goe up to     percent   so core pce seem to have move into a channel that appear to be slight abov a   percent annual rate  but that is in the context of still veri high profit margin  which could veri readili begin to declin and bring the inflat rate down  it is difficult to judg at this stage how to play this  but it is veri obvious  look at the data  that what we are interpret as cost pass through is essenti an increas in profit margin  the reason is that  if final price remain unchang and cost increas  that is anoth way of say that the cost pass through   not exist and profit margin contract   on the other hand  if there is a full cost pass through  of necess final price must rise as profit margin remain intact   therefor  profit margin are probabl a good indic on a consolid basi of the degre of cost pass through  which we have seen happen at a fair pronounc rate   as i said befor  we   ve had profit margin rise at the fastest pace in twenti year  and that   s anoth way of say that we have move from a price discount environ to one of full price power   rememb  it   s competit that enforc the tendenc of real wage eventu to parallel product growth   if that is the case  algebra we are talk about a constant share of profit to nation incom in the long run  our major outlook problem at this stage get to the issu of tri to es  total unit cost and more specif  on a consolid basi  unit labor cost   the latter  as you know  compos two third or more of consolid cost  here we have a veri interest set of number   we know  as some have comment  that averag hour earn have realli been quit contain and    inde  are run below   percent at an annual rate   wage and salari per hour that are implicit in the person incom data are run signific higher   and i have the data here if i can onli find them in my usual well organ file system    paus   i have them now   the tabl with these data was sit where it was suppos to be  and therefor i couldn t find it  in the first quarter  wage and salari per hour were rise at a     percent annual rate and were increas at a somewhat higher pace in the april   may period  what that tell us is that the averag hour earn of supervisori worker  which are not publish separ  must be rise fair signific or  altern  the way we usual term it is that the skill   lesser skill differenti is continu to open up in the wage market   anoth way of put this is that averag hour wage of colleg graduat are rise fa  than those of lesser educ worker   now  this obvious rais question about the meaning of the aggreg unemploy rate as it affect this total system   as far as i can see  there   not appear to be anyth in the month data that suggest that overal wage and salari per hour are acceler in ani materi way  obvious  our analysi is run into other labor incom and supplement that are somewhat stronger  but the problem at this stage   not appear to be an acceler in wage   the basic problem is an appar slowdown in product that is creat the possibl of increas unit cost that will either affect profit margin or get pass through into higher price  all that said  the data as best i can judg them at this stage appear to be consist with flat profit margin and unit cost that are rise at an annual rate in the area of  say      percent  or altern with gradual declin profit margin  which is what one would expect in this environ   that would bring the core inflat rate down to a level of about   percent with no real evid of acceler go farther out    without get into the detail of the data we have construct for nonfinanci  non energi corpor  if we consid the impact of oil  obvious we can see fair signific increas in unit cost stem from higher energi cost   incident  when we perform this type of consolid  we also see that unit import cost are rise and then flatten out   in ani event  gasolin price are come down quit consider   one of the reason is that margin both at refineri and at market oper are run well in excess of what one would ordinarili expect  given the refineri acquisit cost of crude oil   in fact  the data point to an excess margin of someth like    cent a gallon  and if that come down  it will have the effect of damp inflat psycholog  i might reiter what has been point out previous  name that measur of long term inflat expect are remark contain   inde  the measur that i find most use in that regard is the forward rate on one year matur nine year out  in other word  it   s the yield associ with the last one year tranch of a ten year note   that yield has bare move   well  actual it has move  it has move down in recent day and is now definit below it level in august        in short  there is no evid in these data that confirm some commentari to the effect that market particip think the fed is behind the curv   if market thought that  we would see some veri signific acceler in inflat expect and increas in interest rate   but there are no real indic in the data that market perceiv us to be behind the curv   the question is what we should do to make sure that continu to be the case   for one thing  i think we have to rememb that how we move forward is a function of how we evalu balanc sheet in the economi   if everybodi held one day paper on the asset side of their balanc sheet and overnight matur on the liabil side  then whatev we want to do would have zero effect on the balanc sheet and the incom statement   that is a critic issu of the financi sector   but   becaus such a matur structur   not general exist  we have to be care not to move too fast and risk destabil the financi system by enforc matur mismatch and other idiosyncrasi in the financi system  rememb  while the carri trade have come down and unwound to a signific extent  as   has point out  so long as the market perceiv that we will move onli on the date of our schedul meet  we can be absolut assur that tomorrow the carri trade will come back for six week becaus one leg of the carri is thought to be guarante   so  in effect there is no way we can creat market expect that put us in a posit of have zero effect at the end of the day when we eventu move  so where we are at this stage in my view is clear that we are go to move  or i hope we   re go to move     basi point today   we have to leav open the possibl that we may wish to move    basi point in august   even so  i would suggest that our post meet statement retain the notion that our further remov of polici accommod will be at a pace that    is like to be measur      but i also think it would be wise on our part to follow that sentenc with a new sentenc that essenti nullifi it but  sn   t elimin it   that sentenc would say     nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect  as need  to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil     if we decid to go ahead in that way  we will leav open the possibl of drop both sentenc at our next meet and then deal strict with the issu  as   point out  of the balanc of risk statement   i   m not say that we need to  or should  but we open up the possibl   i would be veri concern were we to drop the word    measur    this  e larg becaus the market have adjust to it   they are in fact behav as though they know where we   re go today and are in the process of adjust   if polici expect continu to work out   that way over  e  the market effect will be virtual nonexist   now  that is not go to happen as we certain know   even so  i think we have to be care not to take ani action without signific foreshadow what we are go to do one way or anoth   we have the forthcom semiannu tes oni to calibr how we want to be posit for the august meet   and if it turn out in the next three week that we have signific acceler in inflat pressur  i would be prepar to suggest that    basi point is not necessarili what we had in mind   but we don   t need to say that today  and i think it would be a mistak to do so  i conclud with a recommend that we move up our target for the feder fund rate by    basi point and that we issu the press statement that michell will now circul   it refer to the possibl that we may move at a fa  pace  but we will do so onli if necessari  we need to be cautious becaus  if we move at a fa  pace  we may be take risk that we do not need to take   paus   is that statement accept to everybodi
do you want to start a go around on this issu
no  we don   t need a go around on this   if you have an object to the statement  pleas indic it
i guess i can accept this statement   i must say that i   ve been sit on a veri point fenc for a long  e on this issu about languag   would it be reason to ask   to circul in advanc suggest languag for our august meet   to give us some idea about what we are go to do about this so that we can think about it ahead of  e   i think there   s a sens around the tabl   certain i feel this way   that we   ve got to get out from under this languag somehow   and i think we need to spend some  e on this
i think that   s an excel suggest  and there   s no reason that it can   t be done     could give altern suggest   even though we have six week to   do that  there   s no reason that we can   t send out earli version of differ possibl if we decid to drop the last two sentenc
i would be till some of the ground of the two prior   work group  but i can give you altern word on differ rational that the committe consid in it previous discuss of communic polici
if we adopt the propos statement  i think it would also be appropri    perhap in the monetari polici hear  mr  chairman   for you to in some way emphas this last sentenc that has been ad to the statement   i don   t know how to do that exact   but i just worri that an impli commit to the market of move    basi point per meet could leav us with continu declin in the real feder fund rate
this   not say that  it  sn   t make a commit   if you read it veri close  it say that we are forecast that our move are like to be measur but that we will act on the basi of the evid
all i   m say is that i think the way this play out is go to be influenc by the degre of emphasi place on the one sentenc rather than the other sentenc
i agre with that
i hope that we can put a lot of emphasi on the import of the data in drive what we do and tri to back off from that impli commit
that is clear my inclin   rememb  we start with    consider period     then we went to    patienc     and now we   re come to various form of unwind the whole process
this is sort of the great grandchild of    consider period       laughter
it has turn out better than we had ani reason to anticip  and i think we need one more turn of the screw to go back to our old fashion balanc of risk statement   but i don   t think it has to be done today   we don   t need it   are there ani further comment   yes
i have a question about one particular phrase   we have in this statement    hire has pick up      on consider  i   m worri about how that will be interpret in the event that we get someth like a month with         in job gain
but hire has pick up
but if we see a month with         of job creation peopl may say  well  hire is not pick up   so i was think about someth more generic like    labor market condit have improv      that would be more expans and therefor less suscept to second guess   it   s just a question   i think both character are correct  but one is more ambigu in the fuller sens
i have no object to that languag if peopl would prefer that   is that satisfactori to everybodi   let   s make that chang
what were the word      labor market condit have improv
labor market condit have improv      it   s a bit more ambigu  so we don   t have peopl overreact to an individu labor number
i think that   s a use addit   yes
i feel veri much the same as presid pool   about this   i thought we should take the opportun now that we   re increas rate to go back to the old formul   i probabl should have respond to the bluebook sooner with some altern languag  which i work on a littl   i can go along with what you are suggest   i take your point that thing have   gone pretti well with this whole process   but i think there   s go to be some scrutini of the fact that we   re say    measur    and then tri to take it away in the next sentenc
actual  i start that process
i know you did
i don   t think we got a negat reaction to that
mayb  mayb not   i   m not sure i agre with that   but that   s your interpret  and i   m will to go with it   nevertheless  i do think it would be good for   to figur out some way in which we might say what we did and whi we did it and then character the risk in a simpl fashion the way we use to   i hope we   ll go back to statement that are a littl shorter and more formula and stop tri to creat great grandchildren
that   s where we   re head   ani further comment   yes
we may be head there  but rememb this   when we had all of these work group that roger chair regard languag to describ the balanc of risk  we had veri difficult problem shape that into clear communic   first  we have an issu that we   ll never resolv on exact what we mean by the output gap   and when we   re talk about inflat risk  what are we assum about rate   are we assum that the fund rate equilibrium is   percent or   percent or what   we had horribl problem   i think we got into this process part becaus the balanc of risk languag didn   t realli do the job   and i actual think this statement is clear
well  let   s put it this way   we can drop those two sentenc and put in addit sentenc   i think there   s general agreement within the committe as to where we want to go and it   s mere a question of find the appropri languag   so far  this innov of put it in the bluebook i think has work surpris well
i   m just tri to caution everyon not to think that the balanc of risk formul is go to be a panacea becaus it realli wasn   t befor and i don   t think it will be now
well  that   s someth we are about to find out   if there are no further question and this is accept  would you kind read the appropri languag
i   ll begin with the direct itself  which is on page    of the bluebook     the feder open market committe seek monetari and financi condit that will fo  price stabil and promot sustain growth in output   to further it long run object  the committe in the immedi futur seek condit in reserv market consist with increas the feder fund rate to an averag of around    percent     then with regard to the portion of the statement in the press releas that is part of the vote  which is the third paragraph  the word is      the committe perceiv the upsid and downsid risk to the attain of both sustain growth and price stabil for the next few quarter are rough equal  with under inflat still expect to be relat low  the committe believ that polici accommod can be remov at a pace that is like to be measur   nonetheless  the committe will respond to chang in econom prospect as need to fulfil it oblig to maintain price stabil
