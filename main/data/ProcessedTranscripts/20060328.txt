substanti in some case   now let me confess that i author for public releas  of     hesit to includ this chart   the previous chairman chide me onc for show a similar chart that includ the new zealand dollar   the currenc of a countri with a mere   million resid   well  i am probabl skate on veri thin ice with the new chairman  now that the kiwi has return along with that powerhous the iceland krona  the currenc of a countri with about         resid or rough one tenth the size of brooklyn   the point is not to suggest that iceland is on the verg of join the g  but rather that the search for yield went to some pretti distant and unlik place   as we are now discov   it   rais question about other sector that leverag money went into and about which we don   t yet know   the op ist viewpoint is that carri trade in some of these peripher market have been scale back without broader rippl effect   and that these market have been repric to level that seem more appropri   on page    the top

recess  which is not surpris sinc the weakest corpor are less abl to absorb a chang in busi climat   so if a flat or invert yield curv suggest possibl weak ahead  the low default rate for this sector is one indic point the other way   turn to page    i have some word about recent challeng regard reserv manag   besid the usual anticip effect that we have seen in past mainten period when the market expect a rate hike at an fomc meet  the fund rate and our manag of reserv in the current mainten period   which end on wednesday   was heavili influenc by reserv manag at one larg money center bank   the bank of new york   in the top panel  the effect of the market   s expect of a polici rate hike at this meet are reflect in the smooth upward progress in the morn feder fund author for public releas  of     rate   shown by the blue circl   at the start of this mainten period  the fund rate in the morn was right at the current     percent target   morn rate have risen steadili over the period  and this morn they stood right around the expect new target of    percent   this pattern reflect the kind of gradual approach to the expect new target that we have seen in most mainten period sinc the start of the tighten cycl in june        typic in these mainten period  the desk has tri to lean modest against the anticip effect by provid relat more reserv in the day befor the fomc meet   but in the current mainten period  these effort were overwhelm by reserv manag at the bank of new york  boni   which had an unusu high level of requir   boni   s high requir   around    billion on a period averag basi both last period and in the current period   result from as of adjust appli in these two mainten period to compens for it past underreport of reserv deposit   it normal requir are onli around      million   in anticip of higher rate in the latter part of this mainten period  boni met virtual all it elev requir over the first four busi day of the period and then held near zero balanc over the remaind of the period   boni had indic to us it intent of manag it reserv balanc in this way   but for the first coupl of day we onli part accommod their increas demand  in larg measur becaus the amount seem implaus high and also becaus our experi has shown that bank    state intent and actual behavior don   t alway line up   frank  we were quit surpris at how inelast boni   s demand prove to be  it hold in the first coupl of day effect creat a reserv shortag at all other bank in the system   the fund rate soar late in the day on each of these day  even well abov the expect new target level  and there was consider borrow at the primari credit facil   nonetheless  boni sold veri few reserv back into the market   for the next coupl of day  then  the desk elev it provis of reserv to fulli accommod boni   s state object for reserv hold   as a result  the fund rate was much less volatil and remain so for the rest of the period  even as morn rate tend to reflect more of the anticip effect of the expect rate hike   this episod illustr the potenti effect that just one bank with a larg level of requir can have on the entir fund market when it dramat adjust it reserv hold in a veri inelast fashion   if the desk is awar of these plan and can have confid that the bank   s action will conform to it state plan  then it can compens in it provis of reserv suppli   but it may not alway be possibl to meet these condit   mr  chairman  there were no foreign oper in the period   i will need a vote to approv domest oper   author for public releas  of
thank you   on the end of quantit eas  what are the technic barrier to withdraw the extra reserv that set three month or four month as be the expect  e
they have a seri of oper into the futur  they own  for exampl  treasuri bill that may have certain matur   they may have repurchas oper  which initi they start with short term repo  and then they extend the matur of those repo even as far as nine month  i think  at the far end   so they could take drain action  but a more passiv way would be just to let those oper matur  and then you have a natur drain that happen without take activ step as it were   so three month is a reason es  for their abil to let a lot of those reserv drain passiv without take overt drain step  although they may have to do some of that as well if they want to do in about three month   they could acceler the process  but my sens is that they would rather not
what   the market make of this    understand    that inflat is between   and   percent in japan
i think peopl are take the bank of japan at it word   that is  the member were poll  and each individu   s understand of price stabil was within that rang   they   ve said it repeat  and i think peopl are accept that it   s not an inflat target per se   although whether it   s more like an inflat goal  who know   i think that   s one of those subject that will provid a lot of grist for discuss
final  how much of the movement in the long term japanes govern bond reflect inflat expect   they have inflat link bond
they do  and i   m tri to rememb what they did   they did widen out somewhat  but veri littl   but if memori serv me right  i believ that their breakeven were in the author for public releas  of     area of    to    basi point in the ten  to twenti year period   so there isn   t a huge premium built in  at least into the breakeven
other question for dino   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   two question  dino   on the fed fund rate  i notic we have a high of     percent one day and    the other   you said there was consider borrow   but is the lombard window still seen as insuffici avail to cap the rate  or is it just that there were hard ani trade up there
there were some trade   i think what we   ve observ at the desk in talk to bank reserv manag is that some bank are take us at our word and are not afraid to step up and borrow   and are not afraid to arbitrag against those who still feel the stigma   but  clear  some bank still think that come to the window carri a stigma  and so you do have  to some degre  those that are will to take us at our word and take advantag and those that are not   and a lot of that bias seem to reflect the feel of senior manag   the trader some   sn   t want to go to the senior manag and say     i want to go to the window
i would also point out  governor kohn  on the day in which there was trade at      abov the lombard rate  one larg money center bank borrow from the window and then couldn   t place it   subsequ  the bank wound up hold a portion of the fund itself
my second question has to do with new zealand and iceland   i guess i thought you ascrib this entir to an unwind of the carri trade   but i thought there were other thing go on   i thought that there were some veri weak data for new zealand  so that despit the declin in the new zealand dollar  interest rate actual fell there  and that there was a report from some scandinavian bank about problem in the iceland bank system   i hesit to ascrib this situat entir to the carri trade  author for public releas  of
we   d like a full report on the iceland     laughter
i thought that the committe   s patienc might be limit   yes  there was a downgrad by one of the rate agenc of iceland   there were some concern about some of the iceland bank  and so that seem to be part of the stori   you did have some weak data in new zealand  and i guess the central bank there is now expect to be eas over the cours of the next year   so some other thing were go on   yet anoth factor affect new zealand   which  again  may be more detail than you want   is that japanes retail investor have been big buyer of these uridashi  which i know you know about   and some of that money is now flow back  thus  a number of factor are affect it   again  at the next meet i will give you a full report   laughter
this suggest that the bank of new york realli paid a lot in opportun cost to hold those reserv earli   is that your sens   and  if so  do you have a sens of whi they were interest in pay up to hold the reserv earli
well  i guess i would look at it slight differ   they held the reserv earli in the period at a lower rate becaus they were anticip that
yes   but they could have lent them out later in the day at a lot more  right
oh  i see what you mean   yes
the opportun cost at the end of the day was pretti high
yes   i can onli specul  but my sens is that they had a plan for how they want to manag reserv in the period   they didn   t  then  want to game the system as it were  given that they themselv were respons for some of the issu dure this period   so for them author for public releas  of     then to take advantag of someth that they had creat in the first place   that probabl isn   t  someth that they want to do
well  actual  i   m sorri  but i want to follow up on the zloti    laughter  and  by the way  there are    million sheep and close to   million peopl in new zealand   but i   m curious  just think about trip wire  one would think  as you said  that as rate rise and with better credit  one would move away from emerg market currenc   do you see ani undu concentr  or do you think that this might roll over  say  to the latin american and some other
right now  there are no sign of that   again  the hard data that we have are limit   so some of this inform is anecdot  and some of it we are read from price relationship and correl that we see   right now  i can   t tell you that there is ani evid to suggest that the latin currenc might be next   the situat seem to have been fair isol so far   my point in rais this issu is that  basic  the world look pretti good right now   market look pretti good   again  you   re go to have to go to iceland to find some sign of strain   so  overal  the pictur is posit   but it   s use to remind ourselv that some leverag money out there has gone off into some fair obscur place
mr  chairman  i   d note that the former presid of harvard is advoc diversifi portfolio in these kind of currenc
presid     author for public releas   of
this is probabl beat a subject to death   but i want to follow up on the bank of new york situat and the upward tick of the fed fund rate in the period lead up to what the market anticip will be a chang in our rate   if you can rememb back to when we didn   t provid a lot of guidanc  did we have this same kind of thing base on market expect
no   it has been a phenomenon in this sens in this cycl   governor kohn will rememb better than i do  perhap   you might have gotten anticip effect in the day or two befor meet  when there were keen expect  but you didn   t see them on the first day of the reserv mainten period  which is what we see now
right   and noth as dramat   you   ve talk about this befor  but it is quit graphic here
if there are no other question  i need a motion to ratifi domest market oper  sever   so move
without object   mr
thank you  mr  chairman   i thought that i would address three relat question in my remark this afternoon   first  how much momentum is there in current econom activ   second  how close is the committe to have put in place suffici restraint to prevent output from overshoot it potenti  with attend consequ for inflat   and final  how do we view the current state of resourc util  and what are the implic of that assess for the inflat outlook   let me turn first to the question of momentum   at the last fomc meet  i indic that the staff was in a state of denial concern the meager   percent rate of increas in real gdp that the bea had just publish as their advanc es  for the fourth quarter of last year   we were skeptic that the growth of output had actual been that weak  and we thought that growth  to the extent it had been soft  would bounc back sharpli in the current quarter   i am reliev to report that subsequ develop appear to have support that interpret   we now es  that growth of real gdp was about    percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter   notic abov the advanc read and about halfway back to our januari  book project   moreov  activ appear to be snap back in the current author for public releas   of     quarter   we es  that real output is grow at a pace of more than     percent this quarter   although  in broad stroke  those develop paint a pictur close to that which we envis in januari  we have had our share of surpris to contend with   most notabl  consum spend and busi spend have been consider stronger than we had project   real pce is project to have advanc at an annual rate of    percent this quarter   some of that strength reflect a bounceback in motor vehicl purchas   but even set that asid  real pce appear on track for a    percent increas in the current quarter  near a percentag point fa  than we had project in the januari  book   in the busi sector  we are project an increas in real outlay for equip and softwar of near    percent at an annual rate in the first quarter   like consum outlay  real spend for e s has been boost by motor vehicl sale this quarter  and it has receiv a further bump up from a recoveri in aircraft deliveri   but even abstract from the jump in spend on transport equip  real e s is expect to increas at a    percent annual rate in the current quarter  near   percentag point fa  than we had previous project   our surpris have also extend beyond the spend data  gain in privat payrol employ were revis up in the fourth quarter and averag about         per month in januari and februari   a bit abov our expect   those job gain  coupl with a higher than expect workweek  rais the growth in hour work in the current quarter to more than   percent at an annual rate  near   percentag point fa  than we had anticip in januari   the read on manufactur industri product have also exceed our expect   factori output is now es  to have increas at a   percent annual rate in the fourth quarter and is project to increas at a   percent rate in the current quarter  those increas are  respect    percentag point and    percentag point greater than we had written down in januari   this rather lengthi litani might suggest that the answer to the first question that i pose should be that there is a great deal more momentum to activ than we had earlier expect   but  in fact  for two reason  i   d character the situat as one in which we perceiv just a littl more momentum   first  we have had some downsid surpris as well upsid one   for exampl  construct activ in the busi sector and by state and local govern has fallen short of our expect   the biggest downsid surpris  howev  has come from the extern sector  where a surg in import in the first quarter suggest that some of the addit strength in domest spend was met by foreign rather than domest produc   a second reason for not interpret all the recent strength as ad momentum is that we can alreadi see evid  admit tentat  that some of the strength in the first quarter will be transitori   for one  the jump in feder spend in the first quarter most reflect a rebound from a low level of outlay in the fourth quarter  and author for public releas   of     given this year   s feder budget  real purchas should onli edg up over the remaind of the year   in addit  some of the strength in the current quarter reflect the effect of favor weather in januari and februari on hous construct  and  final  the data on retail sale  shipment of capit good  and industri product suggest that most of the impetus to rapid first quarter growth in these area occur earli in the quarter  recent read have been more subdu   a bit more momentum in privat domest demand  coupl with higher price for equiti and hous and lower price for import crude oil  led us to revis up the growth of real gdp by a tenth both this year and next   but these are realli just minor tweak to an outlook that is much the same as it was seven week ago   if our forecast for the current quarter is close to the mark  the growth of real gdp over the past four quarter will have been     percent   about the same pace that we have averag over the past two year   to me  that seem like a veri reason es  of the current under pace of the expans   the gradual declin in the unemploy rate and the rise in capac util over the past year suggest that this pace has been abov the sustain trend rate of growth  but just by a littl   that assess help to explain our answer to the question of how much more restraint will be necessari to head off the inflat pressur that could follow from a serious overshoot by output of it potenti   our answer is not much more restraint   in part becaus we don=t think that the pace of activ will  in fact  need to slow much   we are assum that the fund rate is rais to   percent by may and then is held at that level through the middl of next year   in our view  that will be suffici to slow the growth of real gdp from it current pace of     percent to a   percent rate next year and to tip inflat down   as growth slow slight below potenti and core inflat edg down  the feder fund rate is assum to be lower a bit in the middl of next year   as has been the case for some  e  hous is central to our forecast of some modest deceler of activ   residenti invest has been contribut about    percentag point to the growth of real gdp over the past few year   so a flatten out of activ in this sector would  by itself  be suffici to bring about the necessari slow in aggreg product   and  rough speak  that is what we are forecast   a few month ago  the deceler in hous activ that we were project was not yet evid in the data   but sinc then  the data have been provid increas support for our view that hous is in the process of soften  on net  both new and exist home sale have retreat from last summer   s peak  household sen ent toward homebuy has turn down  and builder attitud have deterior   even hous price appreci appear to have slow in recent quarter   to be sure  not quit as much as we thought it would  but at least it now seem to be move in the anticip direct   about the onli hous indic not signal some soften is the start figur themselv   howev  as i note earlier  we think that start were boost consider by favor weather in januari and author for public releas   of     februari  and build permit  which are less affect by weather  are point to some fallback in start in the month ahead   i   m tempt to chalk this situat up as a victori for the staff project  where victori is defin as ani aspect of our forecast not immedi contradict by the data   but i   m afraid that there is still plenti of scope for surpris in the hous sector   last week= report for februari show an increas in exist home sale and a declin in new home sale certain highlight contrast risk   and although we have been encourag by the recent slow in home price  those data hard confirm that a deceler in hous price is under way   nor  for that matter  do they rule out that we are at the front edg of a more abrupt collaps in price   right now  it feel a bit like ride a roller coa  with one   s eye shut   we sens that we=r go over the top  but we just don   t know what lie below   it is  of cours  an oversimplif to suggest that hous is the onli risk to achiev our forecast of a slowdown with onli a minim amount of addit tighten   but hous is promin becaus we are forecast it to break from it steadi uptrend of the past few year   in contrast  the growth of consumpt and the growth of busi fix invest are project to slow onli a bit between      and      and to remain on solid upward trajectori   growth in real pce is project to averag about     percent over the forecast period   higher interest rate and wane wealth effect from earlier increas in equiti and hous price should act to damp the growth in consum spend   but a pickup in the growth of labor incom and a diminish drag from higher energi price on the growth of purchas power near offset those influenc   in the busi sector  the growth of fix invest is project to averag about     percent over the forecast period   it slow a bit in respons to the deceler of output and final sale   but a low cost of capit and healthi balanc sheet should provid support to equip spend  declin vacanc rate and ongo gain in employ are expect to lift offic construct  and high energi price should provid some continu s ulus to drill activ   so hous take center stage in our project slow in aggreg activ  and consumpt and invest play small support role   we expect the growth of real gdp by earli next year to run about   percent  a bit less than our es  of the growth of potenti output   consequ  by the end of the forecast period  the unemploy rate edg back up toward   percent  our es  of the nairu   this bring me to the third question   how do we assess the current state of resourc util   in set our forecast  we are requir to take a stand on a point es  for the nairu and potenti output   but we recogn  as i   m sure you do  that we are be forc to split hair here   in realiti  the confid interv around our es  of the nairu is veri wide   a    percent confid interv is rough author for public releas   of     plus or minus   percentag point  and a    percent confid interv is about plus or minus   percentag point   moreov  board staff member have done consider research that highlight just how tentat real  e es  of the nairu and potenti output can be   at this point  all we can say is that you are well within a wide zone of uncertainti as to whether the economi is approach  has reach  or has alreadi overshot the nairu   some recent develop could be read as point to greater slack than we are current es    the relat small gain in the employ cost index  eci  over the past coupl of year have been well below that expect by our model  offer the strongest evid in favor of a lower nairu   other wage and price measur  howev  offer a more mix assess   hour labor compens  as measur in the nation account  also deceler last year to a modest pace of    percent  slower than the rate predict by our model   but that came on the heel of a   percent increas in      that was abov the model  with the pattern between the year like affect by some larg swing in stock option exercis   on averag over the two year  this measur of hour compens has run a bit abov model predict   as for price develop  our core pce equat employ a   percent nairu were on track until recent   but in the last few quarter  core pce price inflat has come in a bit below those equat   thus far  these residu are small  moreov  interpret the reason for the recent miss is not straightforward   the miss may reflect a lower level of the nairu  but they could also be signal a smaller pass through of higher price for energi  import  and other commod  and  of cours  they could simpli be nois   in the end  we thought that we had not accumul enough evid against our   percent nairu to make a chang at this point  but we will certain be monitor this aspect of our forecast close in the month ahead   to be sure  an overshoot of the nairu of modest dimens  even if sustain over a coupl of year  would like result in onli a small and gradual updrift in the under rate of inflat  given how flat the aggreg suppli curv appear to be  of cours  the flip side to a shallow aggreg suppli curv is that it would also be more cost to revers whatev inflat might build up over that period   all told  we made onli minor adjust to our inflat forecast in this  book  as neither the price data nor the major determin of price inflat present major surpris   on net  core pce appear to be come in close to our earlier expect   howev  that reflect some small offset error   the nonmarket compon of core pce was higher than we had expect  wherea the market base compon was lower   becaus we give a bit more weight to the high frequenc movement in the market base measur  we are inclin to interpret recent consum price develop as be a touch more favor than we had expect   project oil price also have been mark down  especi in the near term  reduc some pressur on busi cost  author for public releas   of     work in the other direct has been the reacceler in the price of materi and import good sinc last autumn  a further rise in capac util  and a lower unemploy rate   taken togeth  these develop caus us to trim a tenth from this year   s core pce inflat and to add a tenth to next year   s rate  put our project at   percent this year and     percent next year   in sum  our outlook is for pretti stabl inflat   i   ll conclud my remark this afternoon by point out some chang that we made in the  book this round  start with our present of the financi assumpt   it has now been seventeen year sinc the fall of the berlin wall and fifteen year sinc the end of the old soviet regim  so it didn   t seem like rush thing for the staff to engag in littl glasnost ourselv   therefor we have now laid out the detail of our financi assumpt in the  book   as you know  we had alreadi been move in that direct  and do so seem like a logic and use step toward greater transpar on our part   we have also made some import chang in our construct of the altern simul and confid interv   we are now report onli the version of the simul that employ the taylor rule   this has the virtu of reduc the number of permut that we present and of focus on the one that seem most relev   that is  on the simul in which polici begin to react to the shock within the simul period   to further facilit their interpret  we have ad a chart that present the baselin path for the fund rate  an accompani confid interv  and the polici path that are generat by the taylor rule for each of the altern scenario   final  we shorten the sampl period over which we generat confid interv for the  book forecast and those that are generat by stochast simul of the model   we now start those calcul in       rather than in        when we first start report these confid interv four year ago  we choos the longer sampl on the concern that we couldn   t rule out shock like those experienc in the     s   subsequ  we have had shock similar to those in that period  and the great moder still appear to be hold  so we think a stronger argument can now be made for use the more recent period  all in all  we hope these chang make the document a littl clearer and a littl more use     will continu our present
we now have complet fourth quarter data for u s  trade and the balanc of payment   sever element of those data seem to me to be worth mention at this meet as they correspond to issu with which we have wrestl in put togeth the intern portion of your  book forecast   the u s  current account deficit came in at an annual rate of      billion in the fourth quarter     percent of nomin gdp   the jump from the previous quarter was sizabl  and the number give me  at least  a bit of sticker shock   with      billion alreadi record  it is not surpris that our forecast for the current account deficit cross    trillion and reach about   percent of gdp by the end of the forecast period   with the u s  economi project to perform well through the end of next author for public releas   of     year  we have no reason to expect that the financ of such a larg deficit will caus problem in foreign exchang and asset market   but the risk of such problem is again a factor in the forecast   the deficit on good and servic  at      billion  account for most of the fourth quarter current account deficit   of that figur  the non oil merchandis balanc is about    percent   the balanc on trade in servic is actual a small posit   we look for the bill for import oil and the balanc on servic trade to chang littl through the end of        howev  we expect that the non oil merchandis balanc will widen signific over the forecast period  contribut a littl more than one half of the increas in the current account deficit  and that deterior of net invest incom will larg explain the remaind   net invest incom had remain stubborn posit even as the unit state becam a larg net intern debtor   the initi releas of fourth quarter balanc of payment data show a small negat for net invest incom   even if that negat is subsequ revis away  we expect a negat chang in the incom balanc through the end of next year that is almost as larg as the widen in the non oil merchandis trade balanc   the declin we anticip in net invest incom reflect both the grow u s  net debt posit and the project rise over  e in the interest rate appli to our net posit in fix incom asset   the inform avail to us about the financ of the extern deficit for last year as a whole support our view that there is no basi for expect an immin  disrupt consequ for asset market of the grow u s  extern imbal   in       privat foreign investor made net purchas of u s  secur that total almost as much as the entir current account deficit   this categori of financi flow increas great from the previous year  consist with upward pressur on the dollar in exchang market over much of that  e   the appetit of privat foreign investor for corpor and municip bond was particular strong   foreign direct invest into the unit state also rose dure      to a figur that is quit robust  even if not at the scale of the extrem larg inflow in the late     s and        the offset flow of direct invest abroad by u s  entiti were small  reflect the temporari  favor tax break on repatri foreign earn   report foreign offici hold of dollar in the unit state did increas last year  but at a rate signific below that in        of the      billion increas in foreign offici hold report in the  book for       a veri larg portion is due to increas offici hold by china   although offici japanes hold of dollar asset had signific risen in       the end of exchang market intervent by japanes author in march of that year result in no further offici acquisit of dollar asset last year by them   oil export  particular russia  account in      for a moder share of the chang in foreign offici dollar hold   all told  foreign offici acquisit of dollar asset   not appear to have been a domin featur in the pictur of financi flow paint by the balanc of payment statist for last year   author for public releas   of     beyond the current quarter  our baselin forecast call for real export of good and servic to expand at an annual rate of   percent   this export growth main reflect our outlook for real gdp growth abroad   we project that  over the final three quarter of this year  averag real output growth abroad will be compar to that of the u s  economi  for next year  we expect foreign growth to exceed u s  growth by about   percentag point   we see the global expans as broad base across region  with real gdp growth in the emerg market economi signific fa  than that in the industri countri  but with both group do well   we expect that  among the foreign industri countri  canada and the unit kingdom will continu to be relat strong and japan   s recoveri will becom well establish  although it rate of output growth will abat somewhat go forward   among the asian emerg market economi  we look for a slow in the rate of growth from recent rate  import in china  but expect that on averag those economi will maintain a pace of expans of near   percent   in latin america  we project that our major trade partner will all see solid growth that averag almost   percent this year and a bit less next year   although the dollar move up slight over the intermeet period  we again forecast some dollar depreci in real term  as we remain mind of the financ requir pose by our extern deficit   over  e  that depreci should work to boost our real export  although for the forecast period the lag effect of dollar appreci dure      are more domin and the contribut from the dollar diminish rather than strengthen through the end of        dollar depreci should add somewhat to import price inflat this year and next   howev  chang in global commod price have been sizabl and have larg determin the path of nonfuel core import price   price of global nonfuel commod have ratchet up further in recent month   futur price for these commod indic some futur flatten  but lag respons to these increas should boost core import price inflat to   percent this year befor some deceler occur next year   our project for the u s  economi  for relat price of nonfuel import  and for global energi price combin to impli a rate of growth for real import of good and servic over the remain seven quarter of the forecast period that is slight greater than that for export   with nomin import current more than     percent of nomin export  the result implic for the nomin trade deficit is inevit a further widen   in our baselin for this  book  the contribut of export to u s  real gdp growth for the rest of this year and next is  at an annual rate  just a bit more than     percentag point   the arithmet contribut from import vari by quarter  in part becaus of the way real import are season adjust   on averag  import subtract more than export add  result in a net negat contribut to gdp growth from the extern sector that is     to     percentag point at an annual rate
are there question   presid    author for public releas   of
dave  i was struck by the altern scenario in which product growth is slower becaus  even with the taylor rule in place  it make inflat rise rather than nomin compens growth fall   so i was just wonder    that result convey a lack of credibl in the es  taylor rule  or what do you think is go on there
i think it just reflect the fact that these cost pressur develop rather quick in that slow scenario and that they are pass through one for one into price  and the taylor rule is respond slowli to that pickup in inflat   but when you say    credibl    of the taylor rule  the outcom base version of the taylor rule is what we show in the bluebook   that is not an op  polici  of cours   that is an es  rule base on past observ about monetari polici respons   so it was just a straightforward mechan read of what that rule produc
i have a comment and a question      you speak of the capit inflow to the unit state as financ the current account deficit   sure these are simultan determin   in addit  i think the shorthand statement is probabl better the other way around  the privat investor are move fund not for the purpos of financ the current account deficit but to financ their own invest   that is whi they are move the fund   and it is probabl better shorthand to say that the current account is financ the capit account inflow as a consequ of where the exchang rate is bid with the capit flow in  my question relat to a differ topic   the oil price situat   you hear a lot of market commentari to the effect that mayb     a barrel is in there becaus of uncertainti about iran  nigeria  and elsewher   when you look at u s  data  you know that inventori is build   certain refin product   and clear you cannot have a     plug in there forev if there is no author for public releas   of     suppli disturb   eventu the inventori accumul  and the price will weaken   what do we know about petroleum inventori  both crude and refin product  around the world   the  book  part    has the u s  data  but what do we know about elsewher in the world
i just cannot resist the temptat to make a brief respons to your comment  and then i will answer your question    laughter
which is fine
you know  one can approach a general equilibrium process in ani number of way  and find thing that are truli exogen to that process is veri  veri difficult   so it is certain true that the capit flow might be exogen   howev  my guess is they are respond to endogen econom activ in the unit state and the way we are behav   trade is certain endogen   save and invest behavior has some exogen characterist and some endogen characterist   i take your point  but it is still nonetheless true that  even if the rest of the world want to invest in the unit state  if we save more  we would not have to borrow just becaus they wish to lend   and our save more would have an implic for asset price and exchang rate and incom that would lead to a general improv outcom that would  over  e  have a differ characterist than the one that we have observ   so no one exogen thing is drive everyth els  and that statement is as true for the capit flow part of the stori as it would be to say that the current account is the driver and everyth els is in respons
i think we are in perfect agreement on the econom   it is just the way in which we are talk about the situat
we have veri littl inform on inventori elsewher   there are data through the intern energi agenc on inventori in countri belong to the oecd  but they realli do not tell us much  and  to be honest  i do not have them with me   the inform may author for public releas   of     be buri here somewher  but i do not know that i have it  and i will not take the  e to look for it  the pictur of where inventori are is general incomplet  particular becaus the major mideast produc and the major emerg market produc are not report their inventori to the oecd   the inquiri is unanswer  now an effort  of which the unit state is veri support  is under way to improv the qualiti of the data in the energi market  and that effort may some day speak to the question   some of these inventori may be in gas tank next to factori or next to generat  some of them are held in huge tank in port   the locat vari huge  all of that said  i alway think that the risk premium in the oil futur curv must somehow resolv itself the way you suggest  but it is not someth that happen over a short period of  e  the inventori behavior is strateg  it is not the residu   it is everi bit as much deliber as anyth els is   and so  as a consequ  when oil suppli seem riski   as  say  the event in nigeria of last week or the general situat in iran   peopl want to hold more inventori   so there may be upward support on that price until inventori reach the level at which peopl are happi  and then the price might reced  but it is not as if that price increas is somehow a pure financi phenomenon and has no econom consequ   on a fundament basi  price is drive that inventori accumul  and it is consist with the inventori accumul that peopl want  given that they perceiv suppli to be riski
i have two brief question  one for   and one for     to    my question is whether or not you have chang your assess of the normal gap that we should expect between the core cpi and the core pce  sinc those two measur seem to give rather differ read about the strength of inflat pressur   i have long thought that     or     was author for public releas   of     the natur differenti to expect between those two measur   but it look as though  at the moment and perhap go back sever year  the averag differenti between the two measur may have narrow to someth closer to a quarter of a point   we have talk about this as a my i  but i wonder whether  becaus it is persist  we should not be benchmark our view of the core cpi at a slight differ place than  say    be the equival to     on the pce  and for    my question has to do with the evolut of net export and the differ between your persist forecast of worsen net export and the forecast of macroeconom advis  which you have probabl look at  which project a turnaround     mention that we onli need to see a modest slow or a downturn in the hous sector to realiz sustain growth go forward   but that assess is conting on what   s forecast for everi other compon of aggreg demand   as i compar the  book forecast to macroeconom advis    forecast  the thing that realli stand out  and has stood out for quit a long  e  as a consist  strong differ is the  book   s forecast that net export will be a grow drag on the economi and macroeconom advis    view that net export are just pois to turn up   i assum that the differ come down to differ in your assess of the effect of past depreci of the dollar on net export   my question is  is that right   i am assum that you are well awar of this differ  and i am just curious to know what your perspect is on that
i will start out with the gap   inde  we have been surpris by the strength in the nonmarket compon of pce price  and in this forecast round  we revis up our implicit project for that compon go forward   over the next two year  we are look at a gap that is expect to narrow from where it was  and it is more like to be   percentag point or so   and  as you know  we do not have a good model for the nonmarket compon of core pce  so much of what we are do is tri to gaug what that gap has been and where it will be  rather author for public releas   of     than model it on the basi of an econom behavior set of equat   thus i would suggest that we have had in our own mind a slight recalibr of that gap in the direct that you were suggest  at least for the next two year
we have notic a chang in the relationship between the core cpi and the chain core cpi  which suggest to us that mayb someth is go on relat to substitut bias at the upper level of the index   you focus on the nonmarket compon of the pce  and i wonder if someth unusu might be happen with the core cpi relat to other measur
that chang or  in essenc  the weight bias portion of the cpi  look at the chain versus the laspeyr version has that move around a lot   more so than we had ani reason to believ it would when chain weight was implement   again  we have just flow along with that rather than actual think that there has been some fundament chang   that the substitut bias has gotten signific larger or signific smaller   but we have been impress with how much it has move on a year to year basi
i don   t have as good an answer for you as i wish   one of my concern for some  e now has been that the forecast i observ from other reput folk  and macroeconom advis is among them  do not contain as much deterior in the extern sector as our forecast becaus i interpret at least one possibl resolut of that is that they and other and their custom are go to be surpris when they turn out to be wrong and we turn out to be right   laughter   and i ask myself     what are these peopl drink for breakfast       laughter  i have some paper with me  and i can give you a quick answer   look through to       so over the whole forecast  they have lower real import than we have  yet they have a stronger u s  growth rate  on balanc  and higher export than we have   their dollar forecast is about like our   it has a small dollar depreci in it   the rest of the world pictur is not as fulli articul as our  author for public releas   of     so i cannot realli say  but i doubt veri much that they have the rest of the world just grow like gangbust and that just explain everyth   i have to assum that down deep they have someth structur in their model that is either some combin of less asymmetri in the incom elast on real import versus real export and or more sensit to the exchang rate than the rough   percent elast that we have   how much is each of those piec   i do not know   let   s put it this way   the number they have down here for the annual averag for      is below the      billion in the nomin current account balanc that we have alreadi achiev   i cannot imagin that anybodi look right now at the global economi think that we have peak in term of the current account and that we are go to start improv   i cannot imagin whi anybodi would think that
i just want to ask a question relat to what     was ask befor   i focus just on the altern simul   i focus on the greater cost pressur simul  which had in the second half of       core pce inflat go up to     percent and yet the fed fund rate was go up onli to           over the baselin   and this just did not seem to track with my intuit as to what we would be do as a committe if  in fact  we had such high rate of core pce inflat in the second half of this year   now  i realiz that you said this is base on histori and that this is what the fomc has done in the past  but i would hope that we wouldn   t do it in the futur    laughter   i was wonder whether there is some other way to specifi the polici respons that might be more help to us as we consid what we would do in the futur
certain one option would be to provid some sens of what an op  polici respons would be   a second option would be to use the kind of taylor rule that we were use previous  which was just a calibr taylor rule   we made a conscious decis in some sens not to do that  to tri to harmon what was shown in the bluebook with what is shown author for public releas   of     in the  book   but i am get some feedback from my custom here today  and i will certain take that on board  there are two element as to whi the respons look as small as they do   one is that inflat is extrem inerti   and the polici rule has inertia in it as well   as you know  we did a special present to the committe a coupl of year ago on whi there are lag interest rate in polici rule   this rule is one that incorpor a lag interest rate in it  so it produc consider more inertia   obvious our hope is to provid someth that you will find both credibl and use  and to the extent that we get feedback from you about what we could improv  we would be happi to make some adjust in that
let me just make two other point  presid     the rule itself is explain in the tabl in the bluebook  and i would add two more properti that dave has mention   one is that it es  start in       and the implicit inflat goal in that rule you  i think  would find unaccept becaus it includ a higher inflat rate period earli in the sampl  second  as dave mention  in fact  there are two lag of the nomin fund rate in that quarter predict equat   but i guess the other part of my respons is  well  you have not told us what your inflat goal is   laughter  and so we do not have mani altern except to look at histori to see how this committe has act   and if you stretch back long enough to have a satisfactori  e period over which to es  the equat  you are probabl go to misspecifi what the inflat goal is
well  i know we have not specifi an inflat goal  but i certain think this could be below     percent becaus this actual has real rate come down  as you point out in the altern simul
presid  n  author for public releas   of
dave  my question pertain to the labor market and resourc util issu  there is a comment in the  book to the effect that the strong labor market will caus labor forc particip rate to move up in the short run   while that statement certain sound plausibl  is there ani evid for that kind of effect
no   in fact  we have a slight     bump up in the near term in the particip rate  but basic in our forecast the particip rate move sideway
yes  i saw that in the tabl
and by have the actual particip move sideway to meet our trend that is move down  we were tri to convey in essenc that some implicit tighten is go on there   so  in fact  we felt quit comfort with what i recogn was a somewhat adventuresom forecast for the trend particip rate  which was to have it go down as much as we do in this project   but it look pretti good over the past year as a forecast   even as the unemploy rate has come down  we realli have not seen much of ani recoveri in particip  which make us a bit more confid  or at least a bit more comfort with our forecast  that particip is not go to be head up signific
i have a question for   and a custom request for     my question to   concern the elast of labor suppli within our own border  and my specif question is the impact of immigr on the nairu   i assum that we have had some benefit in lower the nairu base on immigr  and i am wonder     if you have begun to calcul what the effect of these anti immigr bill might be on the elast of labor suppli  author for public releas   of     and my custom request to     one thing that i notic particular in read through the  book  begin with the domest section  is that we are hit between the eye right off the bat with the question of capac util and resourc util   the intern section discuss net export and growth figur   is there a way     that we can over  e get a sens of what we get right to at the begin of the domest section   the degre to which resourc are be util outsid the unit state in a way that affect the decisionmak of businessmen and businesswomen in the unit state   you know that i worri about this dynam   but i am curious as to whether we can get a measur of the capac of other to suppli input into our economi or process that not onli facilit econom growth but also affect inflat beyond just the price of import good   i do not see that as much in the intern section   i see at least the attempt to get to it  whether or not we agre analyt  in the domest section  those are my one question and my one request  if possibl
i can give you one answer and one waffl    laughter   the answer is    no     we have not done ani calcul to my knowledg of how the pend immigr reform bill would affect the natur rate   i would realli want to consult with my labor expert befor i even ventur an answer about what the effect of increas immigr would be on the nairu  one could imagin that the unemploy rate for those group are higher than averag and that immigr could actual be a factor boost the nairu   howev  if immigr is affect reserv wage of worker who are alreadi here  there might be some movement along the labor suppli schedul that could potenti lower the nairu   so i guess i don   t want to shoot from the hip on that one   that seem like a pretti hard question  and i   d want to do a bit of think about it
our guy   or at least the research we have in dalla   tell us that a substanti portion of employ growth has been fed by immigr in the unit state sinc author for public releas   of            i don   t know the specif number  but i   m just worri and curious   i have a question about whether cut off that suppli or chang the natur of that suppli will affect us and  if so  how
i   m just go to waffl right from the veri begin    laughter
i hope my question wasn   t too waffley
i   m not so sure exact   we will give it thought   there   s a fair amount of literatur develop about global capac util   is it defin   we don   t talk  for exampl  about capac util in oklahoma   we assum that if oklahoma need stuff from the rest of the unit state  it just get the stuff  and vice versa   whi is the global economi ani differ   is the unit state small enough relat to the whole world that it can just do that   that   s sort of the epitom of the small open economi model wherebi it can buy anyth it need at the go world price and it can sell all it want at the go world price   but if i take that model as my benchmark  it realli   that all through price   it say that the small open economi can buy import product  resourc  input  whatev  just by know the price  and sell to an infinit elast demand curv for it output  so it is certain true that we have paid attent to thing like global commod price and global energi price  as the activ elsewher in the world have shift global demand and have move those price   it is no end of frustrat to me that the futur market alway say that  howev much those price have gone up   or mayb even occasion down   over the past so mani week or month  they are go to flatten start tomorrow   you just get veri littl dynam out of those futur price   no one is out there think about the global economi over the next three year  look ahead at this  that  or the other thing   on the other hand  we   ve talk about not use those futur price  and i don   t know whether on our own we have the capac to do better than those price   so i   m stuck   but i understand the point  and it is certain the case that huge author for public releas   of     chang   suppli shock to the global economi   are in some sens part of what   s happen and that they ought to have some repercuss for us   part  i think  that   s a littl bit of what   s go on in this notion of whether pass through has declin over  e  but we   ll give the subject some more thought  and we   ll see if we can come up with some other sort of indic  such as bottleneck  as when the ship industri was have problem  whether it was just port congest  huge price on capac  or someth els   you could trace back bottleneck  and you could think about the consequ of them for the u s  forecast  say  but someth that is more inclus than particular bottleneck for particular kind of good is a tougher question
dave and    my question is basic to ask you to give me your sens of the risk   in read the  book  i have a sens that the risk is balanc   i see that interest rate go up and then they come back down   so i understand that overal the risk is balanc in your view   but what do you sens are some of the most press risk we have   becaus when you look at the altern scenario   and they   re veri interest   two of them  the product factor and the term premium on the yield curv  seem to have the greatest effect   but what in this outlook do you sens is perhap our greatest exposur   i think that   s what we   re tri to anticip   where the economi will be and what may affect it negat
well  again  over a longer period  i think we face a real energi issu as a global economi   and i find it veri hard to believ that energi price are  in fact  go to be five or six or seven or eight year from now where that far date futur price is put them right now  but i   m sure they   ll go both up and down in between   and for the period over which monetari polici is made  i can   t do better than what the market are see   i am expect that  over  e  author for public releas   of     the standard of live of mani  mani  mani peopl on the planet is go to rise   and i   m assum that the rise will impli some overal higher consumpt of energi per capita and that the higher price are inde precis what we need to s ul new technolog  to s ul substitut in all the right place   it will be becaus the economi is grow that price of energi will go up  not becaus the economi is somehow go to get in troubl  other thing can also aris   the polit situat in china is by no mean guarante   i may be a bit more concern than other about this subject  but i see no reason not to think that we   ll have anoth bad hurrican season   i just don   t know whi peopl don   t see serial correl in what   s go on with the hurrican   not onli in the caribbean but around the world  we   re see more and more weather driven phenomena owe to the higher temperatur in the ocean and various other thing  but i don   t see endogen weak   i think the global economi in a veri fundament sens actual has balanc risk   mani of the worst shortcom in mani of the economi with whom we trade  both financi and in real good and servic  have been fix   i think the conduct of polici is better  broad speak   i think we could have a veri good five year   i can   t put my finger on anyth that in the next five year is inevit bound to caus us a problem   but i think that over some long period  as more and more peopl have higher standard of live  we are go to have a big chang in relat price   and some economi are go to do a better job of absorb those relat price than other   but the u s  economi might do one of the best job in absorb those relat price chang
for my part  the most salient risk that i would note is hous  for a few reason   one  it   s an asset market as well as a natur invest  and i just don   t know how to forecast those price   i think that  in our present last june  we made pretti clear just what the author for public releas   of     uncertainti are there   beyond that  i   m not sure what the effect will be if  in fact  there is a correct either on the construct side or on the price side   there are just so mani uncertainti  as we   ve note in the past  we use a standard wealth effect to calcul the consequ of that  but there could be bigger effect associ with equiti extract   there also could be confid effect that are difficult to gaug   and so i see big risk on both side   obvious  i   d be more worri about the downsid risk than the upsid risk if we get anoth coupl of year of thing go on as they have been go   it mean that for a while you   ll have to lean a littl harder against the strength in hous  but it also mean you   ll be deal with potenti bigger consequ when the correct in hous market occur  so look at the data  i   m feel comfort with our basic forecast   that thing are tip down   but as i indic  we   re just realli not sure what it   s unwind to   whether it   s unwind to the sort of benign soft land that we   re forecast   we think that forecast is reason   there   s noth in the rate environ or in other factor that make the forecast look far fetch to us   on the other hand  one could certain envis a more pain and bumpier adjust that will caus bigger problem for the committe
ani other question   all right   we come to the first go round   let me remind you that we   re go to focus in the first round on the econom outlook and will leav  i hope  the polici discuss until tomorrow  as you know  there has been interest in increas the interact in this round  so i have a few suggest   first  i will take the liberti of interven occasion and rais a question or ask for comment   second  and this is the riski thing  we   re go to allow two hand intervent    laughter   if you would like to comment or ask a question about a colleagu   s remark  pleas rais two hand  and you   ll be recogn to make short remark to be perhap author for public releas   of     respond to   this process may work too well    laughter   therefor  i reserv the right to play traffic cop  and we   ll take the whole thing as an experi and see how it goe   who would like to go first    laughter   presid

okay   well  most of my contact this  e were upbeat about current condit   though the midwest continu to underperform the rest of the nation  the u s  economi seem to remain on solid foot   so we tri to assess whether the strength in januari and februari was just a transitori bounceback from the fourth quarter or whether it repres some persist forward momentum   and while a few contact express concern about higher energi price and soften hous market   as we were just discuss   most point to an economi with substanti stay power   a bit of good news is that the chicago purchas manag    index  which will be releas on friday  will show a signific increas   from      to       the persist momentum in the economi appear to be creat some pressur on resourc   one exampl is the airlin industri   busi and leisur travel are at veri high level  with strong book for the past few month   load factor are at near record high  in part author for public releas   of     reflect a reduc capac in the industri   there continu to be more report of fare increas  and surpris the increas are now be led by the low cost carrier  we   re hear about tighten labor market   manufactur continu to have difficulti find skill worker   in the temporari help area  manpow   headquart in our district   said that wage growth is acceler nation   three month ago wage were basic flat on a year over year basi   now they   re expect increas of   to   percent in the second quarter of this year   kelli servic  also headquart in our district  report steadi nationwid increas in the   percent to   percent rang   but both compani note that labor market were still nowher near as tight as they were in the late      s  speak of labor market  to updat the gm   delphi   uaw saga    wagon  general motor    ceo  think that the gm buyout plan will take the heat off the poor delphi   uaw relat  lessen the chanc of a strike there   he expect a signific number of gm and delphi worker to sign up for the plan   this will allow them to reduc the size of their workforc more quick   one aspect of this agreement that parti are not public wide  for obvious reason  is that gm and delphi should have more flexibl in hire temporari worker and outsourc in the futur   the temporari worker will have lower wage  and they won   t have the full gm benefit packag  turn to the outlook  i feel that the near term risk to the forecast have chang somewhat sinc our last meet   on the growth front  i had previous thought that high energi price and sticker shock from heat bill might damp spend substanti   and on the price front  i was concern that pass through of higher energi price and other cost could boost core inflat and feed through to inflat expect   neither risk has materi so far   privat domest author for public releas   of     demand appear to be grow at a solid pace   the recent price news has been favor  and inflat expect have move littl  so what are the risk now   i do not see mani immedi downsid risk to growth  to the contrari  i person think that the risk may have tilt to the upsid   it   s true that hous appear to be moder  but the soften seem to be happen much as we expect it to   in contrast  consumpt growth continu to be quit strong   this may be a signal that household are more confid about their perman incom prospect  perhap becaus of healthi labor market and the strong under product growth   if so  then we could be in for some continu robust consum spend   in addit  growth abroad has improv   notabl  japan and europ are show some life   thus  we could see more demand eman from abroad   so in the short term  growth will like exceed potenti   but given a fund rate path like that in the  book  which i would character as a touch restrict  my outlook and the  book   s get growth back to potenti by       despit the recent good read on inflat  the current strength of the economi is show through in our simpl indic base forecast of inflat   we run about two dozen forecast model that encompass common statist indic of futur inflat   these are not structur model   they are simpl regress forecast model that use onli current data  and they have no explicit condit assumpt regard futur polici  oil price  or other such factor   and this contrast with a more structur methodolog like the frb us model   near all of these indic model predict some uptick in core inflat over the next two year   not a big one but to someth a bit abov   percent in        look ahead  these project would probabl move down with a further string of good news about price and more balanc prospect for resourc util   nonetheless  given the model    forecast and the fact that we current are author for public releas   of     oper with veri littl resourc slack in the economi  i see a risk that inflationari pressur will be somewhat greater than what is current built into the  book
do you want to comment on the automobil industri in general and the prospect for product and price
well  i think that  on the product side  the big three produc have slow down somewhat for this quarter and next quarter compar with last year   i think the sale outlook for the industri is realli pretti good   you know  it   s about             million for light vehicl   and the big issu  of cours  is the shift from the big three to foreign produc  which is shift output from the northern part of the midwest to the southern state   so that   s the big  big news in our district   in term of the contribut to the overal economi  i don   t see ani real concern here in         on price  they say that they are tri to cut back on the discount that they have been give  and they have cut back somewhat   but i think the proof will be in the pud as we get into this year as to whether they can continu that
thank you  mr  chairman   may i say it   s a great pleasur to see you back at the tabl   and while i hesit to wish your predecessor   s eighteen year of servic on anyon  i look forward to mani interest and product meet under your leadership  the latest month data show signific strength in activ for the quarter just end  and i agre with the  book   s assess that this strength repres a temporari catch up after the weak fourth quarter   i anticip that growth will like settl back to trend as the year progress  especi as the lag effect of tighter financi condit damp interest sensit sector   the current risk to this scenario are by now a well known litani   hous  energi price  the save author for public releas   of     rate  foreign demand  and term premium   overal  i judg the risk to the growth forecast to be pretti well balanc  i did want to comment briefli on the risk associ with hous   this is the sector that obvious bear close watch becaus it can repres the lead edg of the effect of the monetari tighten   thus far  publish data on hous start and permit provid rather littl evid of a signific weaken in construct activ  although other indic such as home buy attitud and new home sale  along with a grow amount of anecdot evid  suggest that tighter financ condit are final exact a toll   i think one possibl reason that start and permit have remain so strong is that the inventori margin is take up some of the slack in demand   inde  the stock of unsold home on the market has now reach quit high level  i note a similar phenomenon in talk to a real estat develop in what has been the sizzl phoenix hous market   in that market  demand has been so strong that builder couldn   t build hous fast enough to satisfi buyer   so deliveri  e for new home were veri long   and as the demand for new home has slow recent  we haven   t seen a notic chang in build activ  but there has been a signific declin in deliveri  e   as this margin  like unsold inventori  return to more histor norm  i think that we   ll see the moder in demand show up in new construct number as well  turn to inflat  i think it   s worth stress how good recent read have been   over the past twelv month  core pce price are up     percent  the market base compon     percent  and the core cpi just     percent   as i   ve note in previous meet over the past six month  we have been more op ist than the  book about the prospect for core inflat dure        for quit some  e now  we have been on the order of sever tenth of a percentag author for public releas   of     point lower   and i continu to think that core pce price inflat will come in at about     percent this year  as the  book forecast drift down  i think mayb my stubborn is pay off   my relat op  part reflect my view  base on econometr evid use data after the earli     s  that there is littl pressur for higher inflat come from the pass through of energi price to labor compens or core price   anoth import element in my op ist inflat outlook is inflat expect  which i consid to be well contain and unlik to provid signific upward impetus to inflat   at the same  e  i think it   s import not to ignor the potenti advers inflationari consequ from a resurg economi  i realiz the link between resourc util and inflat is a contenti topic   actual  the philadelphia fed   s survey of profession forecast ask it respond whether they use the concept of a natur rate of unemploy in their macroeconom project  and the repli indic a split of about           about half the econom forecast  in other word  use such a rate  and the other half don   t   and my guess is that there is also a consider differ of opinion around this tabl   person  i   m persuad that excess demand in a market   tend to push up price and that the domest labor market is no except to this rule   i think that the econometr evid support that view  presid   has been argu  and perhap some other would agre  that what matter is not just u s  product capac but worldwid capac   i do agre that the world   or  more accur  the aggreg suppli curv   has probabl becom flatter   but while global has had a profound impact on the u s  economi in a number of way  i think that there are a number of reason to doubt that it will overturn  at least complet  the normal histor relationship between domest labor market slack and inflat   the first point here is simpli that mani good and most author for public releas   of     servic still must be produc in the unit state  and so foreign capac isn   t an issu   the second point is that  in order to util product capac in foreign countri  we do need to run a trade deficit  in principl  such deficit eventu put downward pressur on our exchang rate  which tend to rais the price paid for import in the unit state   i   m sure this is a topic we will be discuss in a lot more detail go forward  of cours  the measur of aggreg excess demand or slack is difficult  and i   m sympathet to the view that there is no bright red line for the unemploy rate that  onc cross  trigger higher inflat   but by examin a varieti of indic  i think it   s possibl to get a use notion of aggreg resourc util   i would judg that these measur current fall in a rang from a modest amount of slack to a modest amount of excess demand   specif  the unemploy rate  the vacanc rate  the employ   popul ratio  capac util  and other measur are all within a few tenth  in unemploy rate term  of full employ  look ahead  with the unemploy rate alreadi at     percent  i think it   s logic to worri that wage and price inflat will rise over  e if resourc slack diminish further   and with gdp growth forecast at    percent this year  a nave calcul base on     s law suggest that the unemploy rate could fall to     percent by the fourth quarter   in contrast  the  book assum that the unemploy rate will remain unchang   the  book inflat project is  accord  more op ist than a forecast base on the nave model  now  given the import of the behavior of unemploy to one   s forecast of inflat  my staff has been look at the perform and fit of     s law   name  the relationship between output growth and the chang in the unemploy rate   and i think their analysi provid support for the  book assess   use a dynam version of     s law that fit except well after       my staff find evid of an error correct between the output and author for public releas   of     the unemploy gap   dure       unemploy declin substanti more than a simpl version of     s law would have predict   and this dynam model suggest that  even with fast econom growth  the unemploy rate will like be push up a bit this year  as this unusu declin in      is revers  so to sum up  i see steadi growth and few pressur for price acceler
you address this a bit at the end  but how do you reconcil your op  about core inflat with the view that you have increas resourc util and that it affect inflat
okay   i guess my view is that it   s a risk  but at the moment  by various measur  we   re pretti close to  not beyond  full employ   the unemploy rate has declin unusu rapid over the last year  but a simpl     s law calcul   and i think that the staff has comment on this in the past  if i   m not mistaken   would assess the declin we   ve seen in the unemploy rate dure      as especi larg  given what output growth was   in that sens  the unemploy rate is now give us a read of less slack in the economi than we would get from other indic   our forecast is that the my i declin in the unemploy rate last year will be revers so unemploy will hold steadi  even with growth at the magnitud that the  book is project  around    percent    that   s what the error correct mechan is about  so i   m op ist about inflat becaus i see us end      at rough full employ  with the unemploy rate in the vicin of it current level   i   m also op ist about inflat becaus we   ve been persuad that sinc the     s we   ve seen veri littl pass through of energi price increas into core inflat   that has been a sourc of consider more op  on our part than on  book   s part in that it continu to project pass through of energi and commod price into core inflat through       author for public releas   of
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   i share the view of most that the slow growth in the fourth quarter of last year was  in fact  a temporari aberr that will be offset by strong first quarter growth in the neighborhood of     to   percent   auto sale have alreadi bounc back  and defens spend is unlik to continu declin   and busi invest spend look to be strong   like most outsid forecast and the  book  our atlanta bvar and dsge model are project that gdp growth will be around    percent or so in the second half of      and into        our model also have core pce inflat hold between    and   percent and the fed fund target rate peak at about   percent  although i would character this outlook as solid  and even encourag  some signific uncertainti and risk surround the outlook   i   d like to comment on sever of those risk and  in do so  includ some observ from our region   s experi and contact that seem to be relev  the first set of uncertainti in my own mind revolv around how the residenti real estat adjust will unfold   someth dave and   have alreadi talk about   although the declin in construct and sale and the slow in price appreci seem to be order so far  there clear could be a more disrupt set of chang that we do not now forese   as i report at our last meet  we are now see some signific downward price adjust and cancel of some major condominium project in our red hot  specul driven coastal florida market   at the same  e  other market are see more modest adjust  and it appear that builder are cut back in respons to demand signal   i don   t mean to impli that a major pullback in real estat would caus a precipit drop in econom growth   that would be inconsist with most of our simul and analys   yet growth in that sector could slow even more than we now expect  author for public releas   of     especi if mortgag rate should continu to increas   ad to the unknown with regard to residenti construct is the  e of the kick that will be associ with hurrican katrina rebuild   the  book has built in a measur near term contribut from that reconstruct  but i continu to believ that we   re go to be surpris at how protract that rebuild is go to turn out to be  that bring me to a second concern   our admit uneasi with how well we can explain the behavior of long term interest rate in this cycl  someth we talk about earlier but have not done so much recent   despit the new academ look that i   m work on   laughter  i don   t think i can add ani genius to the possibl explan alreadi offer by the current and the past chairmen  vice chairman    and other   but i was here at the fomc tabl for the heyday of the so call new economi  when we thought for quit a while that we could explain some signific differ behavior  some import element of our economi  onli to learn in hindsight that some of those phenomena turn out to revert to past relationship and past experi  clear  an unexpect uptick in the long term rate  includ mortgag rate  would not come as a complet surpris   it would affect both household and busi spend   i see it as a risk that we should be care not to dismiss too quick  the two uncertainti i   ve just talk about repres downsid risk to output   there   s anoth develop that i think tend to offset those downsid worri   job growth has been strong  in fact  in our region we are hear more and more report of shortag of new worker in a number of industri and with certain job skill   at the same  e  much has been made of stagnant wage for some worker   my staff has analyz data on the wage and on the type of job be creat relat to those be destroy and has found that  although the wage dynam did deterior between      and       wage relationship have sinc return to histor norm  author for public releas   of     moreov  busi survey from both the nation associ for busi econom and the nation feder of independ busi suggest that  although firm put a lid on wage increas dure the         period  the net project of firm that are rais wage has becom more widespread  and it is now about the same as it was dure the     s   this rebound suggest to me that wage growth from net job creation is now lend more support to spend than it has in the recent past  take some of the pressur off other sourc of fund  such as home equiti extract  as our recent post fomc meet statement have indic  upsid inflat risk also remain   it   s still not clear to me that we   ve seen the full long term adjust by household and busi to elev energi price   i continu to hear report of more energi and other commod cost pass through that peopl would like to make  and report of rollback of earlier energi surcharg are few and far between  although i   m not a propon of the nairu way of think about the relationship between unemploy and expect pressur on inflat   a relationship that is hard to see in ani recent empir data   we do need to watch more care than ever for new bottleneck and price pressur in a solid expans that is now four year old   in fact  even though i see that the risk at our current and expect polici set is get close to balanc  as a good central banker i remain at least a bit more concern about the potenti for inflat to edg somewhat higher   i will not argu tomorrow for a signific tighter polici to help push the inflat rate moder down  within the rang most of us have said we view as our object   but i do not think we want to risk a higher level of inflat at this point and risk have inflat expect begin to deterior  i believ the kind of uncertainti that i   ve just talk about demonstr that our read on the path of polici and the proper polici set over the period ahead has becom more difficult to author for public releas   of     get just right and more difficult to explain   and i think that suggest that futur polici action will be determin by the evolut of the econom outlook lend credenc to the spirit of the recent post meet statement   thank you  mr  chairman  and welcom back
thank you   presid   had a comment
yes   i apolog   i haven   t learn the gestur yet    laughter   i didn   t practic them befor the meet   presid    i want to ask you two thing  and they   re relat in my mind   what   s your understand of whi the pass through correl declin in the mid     s   and second  if the interpret has to do with polici  to what extent is that empir and natur rate relationship you were discuss earlier structur   that is  to what extent do differ polici rule affect it slope and posit
well  i think the econometr evid suggest that the pass through has declin and  sn   t speak clear to the reason for the declin   my guess would be that inflat expect have becom better anchor  and market particip have more confid in the fed   s commit to price stabil   and so there are fewer  in effect  inflat scare of the type we had in the      s  when inflat expect becam unhing   in that sens  of cours  it is conting on polici   i think polici has also been more consist respons to movement in inflat   not onli in the sens of have becom more creativ but also in the sens of systemat rais the real feder fund rate in respons to an increas in inflat  which wasn   t alway the case previous
i agre with everyth you   ve said   that   s my hunch about whi that pass through correl fell as well   but then  in principl  shouldn   t an improv in expect about polici have the capac to make that relationship between resourc util and nomin inflat relat flat  author for public releas   of
it certain could
that could be one of the driver   sure  i agre with that
presid guynn  i wonder if you would say a littl more about the katrina rebuild   whi you think that   s go to be veri slow
mr  chairman  the more  e we visit there   we   re go to take our full board down in may   and the more peopl we talk to  our sens is how dysfunct that whole area still is   the state govern still hasn   t got it act togeth   you may have read that the mayor race in new orlean has twenti three candid   i just can   t begin to sens how they   re go to get either state govern or local govern oper  especi with the new hurrican season come up   everyth we see and hear from the field suggest that  until peopl come to grip with what the new flood plain map look like and what the build code need to look like  there will be veri littl real construct go on   it   s still most cleanup   and although we   re get some construct in mississippi  where they seem to be further along  the bigger area that is yet to come is in new orlean   it look like a ten year proposit rather than a two  or three year proposit   and i can   t work ani better number than the staff did here  but i suspect it   s go to be strung out over a realli long  e
thank you   presid
thank you veri much  mr  chairman  and welcom back
i notic that you are without a hawaiian shirt   laughter
next meet  author for public releas   of
next meet  okay    laughter   we   ve had a wide rang of contact in new england sinc our last meet  so what i   m go to do is tri to summar five or six differ thing that came out as a result of this rang of contact  the first point is basic driven by the data   new england continu to grow more slowli than the nation   actual  employ growth year over year is about a third of the pace of the nation as a whole   sort of normal  in a way   new england tend to have a slower grow popul and labor forc than the rest of the nation   but the recent pace of job growth is decid slower than the long run averag   nonetheless  region busi seem to be broad particip in the growth of the overal economi  and even the pace of loss in manufactur job seem to be slow   inde  merchandis export for the region were quit strong despit continu manufactur job loss  suggest that region manufactur have figur out a way to enjoy some product growth and to keep their output relat high  almost all contact have been quit upbeat about sale and revenu expect for this year   most state corpor tax collect have been boom  and retail sale and state sale tax revenu are at or abov budget almost everywher except rhode island   rhode island seem to be go through a kind of flatten of growth   i   m not exact sure whi  at a recent confer of regionwid realtor  op  was express by head of state realtor group that  so far  home sale and price  although they are certain moder  have held up fair well   and that   s even consid the fact that in the fourth quarter of last year  sale in the northeast  unlik for the nation  declin for both new and exist home   but       was view by this group as proceed fair well  there is some evid of tight labor market for certain skill job   we have in one of our advisori group a ceo of a softwar firm that   softwar and consult servic orient author for public releas   of     toward recruit for global      custom   she report that their client around the world are have difficulti hire health care  technolog  financ  and profession level sale personnel   so she was see some real uptick in labor market tight at the high end  and i must say that when you look at commerci vacanc rate  which have declin for class a downtown and suburban space  not just in boston but elsewher  you seem to get the impress that mayb busi haven   t start to hire yet but they do have plan to hire and they do have plan to hire at the high end  final  local measur of price growth remain quit contain  though headlin cpi data indic that the region has suffer more than the nation from high energi and util cost  even with the quit mild winter  in assess the reaction of contact about cost increas  we heard a bit less complain this  e around   mayb peopl have just given up complain  or perhap they have found way   and i think this is probabl more true than not   to offset high commod and energi cost through rise product  the pictur for the nation is even better than it is for new england   we  like the  book author  have been a bit surpris and pleas at the strength of the incom data after the bump in the fourth quarter     mention all the good reason to be pleas   strong employ  solid consum spend  not much evid yet of a larg drag from hous  solid busi invest and product  veri favor financ condit  fa  growth than the rest of the world  and through it all  moder headlin and rather flat core inflat  whether you look at the cpi or the pce  reflect a level out of energi price and continu strong product growth   true  some luck has been involv  particular the rather temper winter weather in the northeast  with it good news for overal energi and electr cost   and the drop in new home sale may be a author for public releas   of     harbing of wors to come   but the first quarter is over  and it was stronger than we expect  even allow for a bounceback from q   look ahead  we agre with the general trajectori of the  book forecast  as we have for some  e   howev  we have pencil in a somewhat greater effect in       on growth from the expect falloff in hous   that is  an actual small declin in residenti invest in everi quarter this year and a relat effect on consumpt from a flatten of the growth in household wealth   so our gdp forecast for       is somewher between three  and four tenth lower than the  book   s  though       is just about the same  we also see a smaller uptick in core inflat this year  larg becaus we see labor market as have a bit more capac than   the  book  which we believ account for some of the moder in wage and salari growth  at least by some measur   it may be split hair to mention what in the end are small differ between boston   s forecast and the  book   s  after all  we don   t have the same number of resourc in boston focus on make a forecast as you do here for the  book   but i think we are at a point where small differ in outlook realli do affect how each of us see the polici choic  now  what are the risk around this benign  if not rosi  outlook   will they continu to revolv around growth that is higher than expect  prompt by a continu of consum strength   if  for exampl  hous take less of a bite out of growth than we expect   and by financi condit that could remain more s ul as well   inde  when we look both at where we   ve been off in evalu the outlook over the past coupl of year and at our own boston forecast  the surpris have most been the result of rise household wealth and a relat set of veri favor financi market condit   if these condit continu  greater inflationari pressur than we expect could well result  given where we are in term of resourc util   and author for public releas   of     of cours  new energi shock are possibl  given the possibl geopolit unrest and tight suppli condit   altern  look at risk on the other side  a greater than expect slowdown in hous  with a relat larger pickup in save rate  could put an unexpect damper on growth  absent new energi shock  this would act to moder both growth and inflationari pressur more than expect   so we see hous as integr to both upsid risk and downsid risk  as i see it right now  the risk to the forecast appear relat well balanc  mayb a touch to the side of inflat   that   s most becaus we   ve had a lot of recent experi with surpris on the upsid relat to growth  with rise energi and commod price  and overal resourc capac is hard to be veri precis about   howev  i realli don   t see larg upsid inflat risk  most becaus of what we   ve seen in term of ongo product growth   it remain solid  and it continu to act as a power buffer   inde  despit the temporari drop off in q   i have not seen or heard anyth from my contact that suggest the under busi drive to be ever more product will slow  or slow any  soon   so although my assess of risk has a small upsid tilt and i am concern about how expens be veri wrong on the inflat side would be  i don   t see the situat as signific unbalanc
thank you   let me just highlight a theme that presid guynn and presid   both mention  which is that some of the tightest labor market condit are for the most skill worker   it seem to me that normal in a busi cycl expans the lower skill worker tend to benefit at least as much as high skill worker   and i just want to rais this theme for the research peopl and for the other princip  to see if someth is unusu here or if we   re just misinterpret what is go on
i don   t think we   re misinterpret it   i think that   s what   s go on

mr  chairman  like the other  i am grate to be here under your chairmanship and also to be with the two new governor who are on board   i will spare you texa hyperbol  with the except of just say that our district is grow fa  than the nation and is pump on all cylind   and i   m go to focus my comment on the ceo and cfos to whom i   ve talk  who have nation and intern franchis  as i am wont to do at these meet  the situat is best summar by one who said     it shouldn   t be this way  but it is      what he   s say and what i   m hear from almost everi ceo and cfo i spoke to  from larg and small compani  with the except of the hous compani  is that they see surpris econom strength and no price power despit signific cost pressur   and that strength is be project not just into the current quarter but also into the second quarter  so let me start with the railroad  with burlington northern   they report that last week they ship more unit than in all but ten week of        and they have intern rais their forecast for shipment of consum good year over year for the second and third quarter  from   percent to   percent   to quot their ceo     it   s just blow and go     up  which is not in our district but i talk to them a great deal  report a   percent volum growth base on last week   s number   it   s consist with what they expect for the first quarter  which is a number greater than   percent   and  again  to use a direct quot     i just do not see peopl pull back     on the retail front  to get to some of dave     s point  the retail at all price point are report that demand is strong and that    the tone of busi is beat our expect     wal mart and their brethren point out that a slowdown would manifest itself in a shift of dispos incom to food purchas   they are not see that   to quot the ceo of that veri larg retail     we thought that there would be a drag from       gasolin  but it   s not happen      they expect author for public releas   of       to   percent comp in april   by the way  assist by the late date of ea   a lot is be shove into march and then some is be carri through into april   the person i talk to there is the ceo of their u s  oper  who is not given to overstat   i had never befor heard him say that    demand is amaz     but that   s what he said in our interact this week   at a higher price point  we talk to  for exampl  the ceo of jcpenney   he said     we would expect to be run doubl digit declin at this point  but we are see posit number with great strength in the southeast  the south central  the west  and also  by the way  the northeast  which is overcom weak in the central and midwest geograph area     at the last fomc meet  i report concern of a major manufactur of drink  juic  food product  and snack  base on the gloomi of what he heard at the grocer    convent in phoenix   he now report that they are less worri and that their concern have lift   and this ceo  whom i would put  mr  chairman   use a winni the pooh analog   in the eeyor categori  alway see the glass less than half full    laughter   mayb becaus he   s in the drink busi  i   m not sure    laughter   he describ the economi as    tick along    and ad that  as i quot earlier     it shouldn   t be this way  but it is     kimber clark  anoth interest compani  which is quit open with us  is a supplier in a differ sector of the market   they report that    despit everyth the consum has been hit with  demand continu to chug along     as for the semiconductor compani  texa instrument has a book to bill ratio right now of        that is  order are come in    percent fa  than they   re go out   in the semiconductor industri  a book to bill ratio of      is consid strong   and they are present front load their capit expenditur from the third quarter into the current quarter in order to meet demand  author for public releas   of     the other eeyor to whom i talk suffer from a genet challeng to be op ist   he   s a norwegian    laughter   he also happen to be one of the larger ship oper in the world  about whom i have report at previous meet in term of the imbal of suppli that   s come on stream and the demand for that suppli   he report that    there is much more demand growth than expect      and you see that growth reflect in the larg bulk carrier  the panamax carrier  which are the most liquid part of the market  where price  as i report last  e  had gotten down to         for a daili rate and are now back up to           the contain fleet is also hold up  with some chang of util from the transatlant shipment to the transpacif shipment   but as he say     these market have leg      and he character the overal sens of the economi with a veri zorba the greek type of summari of event      demand side is stronger  tanker market is hold up  contain market growth is strong   in short  no catastroph     on hous  for which you find the most negat outlook  i have just a coupl of comment   i spoke to two of the five largest hous ceo   what they and their competitor watch for is the home cancel rate   that is  when a buyer put down a minim amount as downpay  which is now down to         on a home and then walk away   the averag home cancel rate has run about    percent in modern histori   right after septemb           it spike to    percent   it is present run at    percent for the nation builder   so  clear  hous is a not veri happi area  everybodi i talk to report continu emphasi on cost contain and on re engin their product function   one of the larg chemic compani report that they use     gas to fix all their boiler and product facil      everyon in the chemic industri is wring everyth they can out of overhead and oper     author for public releas   of     so i decid to follow that subject further down the suppli chain and talk to the ceo of anadarko  one of the largest natur gas oper  who happen to be on our board   they  too  are tri to control cost by central their purchas oper   they purchas about    billion a year  and they expect to drive down cost at the same  e in order to financ a massiv capit expenditur expans  which you would expect to be driven by the high price that they experienc recent   wal mart has put in a massiv one  e enhanc of inventori manag  which is pinch supplier but is provid them with signific save in dollar  all the compani report continu interest in build their offshor interest   again  to drive down the cost of oper   and i thought it was interest that as   duke  the ceo of wal mart intern  was leav india the other day  michael dell   a good texa compani  dell   got off the plane at the same  e and announc that they are go to creat job for        new employe in india   one of the largest secur hous report that they had sent one of their most senior offici four  e in the past nine month to india to figur out a way to drive down the analyt cost by have corpor spreadsheet and other thing done there befor they   re present to the decisionmak for their buy side analysi and their sale side analysi   the ceo of kimber clark gave me a remark number   he had just come back from india   they are look to fill       job   they receiv     million resum in english   a dalla director who is a ventur capitalist report that they will no longer consid provid capit in a second round ventur capit financ unless the compani has a foreign compon for offset cost   final  one of our director in el paso  a woman who manufactur accessori in mexico  has decid to move her mexican oper to inland china to save on cost   my point is that this appear to be now part of our corpor dna in term of tri to drive down or contain cost   again  as the author for public releas   of     ceo of wal mart said     this is not just an issu of low labor cost   it   s an issu of effect enhanc profit     i want to end with a comment of concern in term of my own district  with regard to construct   if you look out the window of our offic in dalla  you   ll see twelv gigant build crane   it almost look like shanghai  and this is old downtown dalla   and i   m remind of the comment that was made by one of my predecessor  bob boykin  at this tabl when he was brag about the fact that  in hunt  in build a project and a hotel   where you   re go to stay when you visit our district   had manag to dig the largest hole ever dug in histori   and your predecessor  mr  volcker  said     are you speak figur or liter       laughter   i don   t know where this will lead  mr  chairman   i do sens that  on the anecdot side  final demand is much stronger than the econometr would tell us   my gut tell me it will end in tear  but we   ll talk about that tomorrow
speak of the largest hole ever dug in histori  i wonder if you would have a view on the current account implic of some of this offshor that you   ve been talk about   are you concern about that
i am concern   i worri particular becaus i think   and i   d have to get the number  but i   m virtual certain   that the shift is take place particular in currenc that don   t adjust to the dollar   india has just announc that they would open the rupe and open their capit account   the chines clear do not have a free trade currenc  and at the same  e  just to show my bias     is go to be veri disappoint in me  i think   i subscrib to winston churchil   s approach to trade  which is if someon els   i won   t use his exact vernacular   want to take advantag of their taxpay and subsid their product and provid it cheapli for us  we should take it  add valu  and captur the major of the profit   so i author for public releas   of     think we are do that   i think there are limit as to how far we can run on the current account deficit   i also expect that eventu the market will correct for that   but we   ve been talk about that for a great deal of  e   last year  we worri about the dollar   s strengthen rather than weaken   and i subscrib in part to what presid pool argu   the question is how long you continu to attract capit  just one more comment on that front  and this is whi i ask the question about the polish zloti and the new zealand dollar   one of the thing i am concern about  mr  chairman  is that my invest instinct tell me  as we rais rate here and as the yield curv perhap shift upward   and perhap someday at the longer end of the yield curv   that there will inde be a greater desir to invest in high qualiti  risk free credit like that of the unit state and to withdraw capit from some of these lesser  margin credit   so there might actual be a short term effect by which we are encourag and embolden by greater capit influenc rather than lesser capit influenc   my overal instinct is that we   re postpon the pain and the correct and it   s further out there
thank you   we have a  e decis to make   we could take a break now and come back   i   d like to propos that we stay in the meet until      and  at that point  go to a recept and dinner   we will probabl not finish this round by       but there will be plenti of  e tomorrow to do that and  e to reflect   is that accept to everyon  to just stay in the meet   all right   well  let   s continu then   the next person is presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   i see littl in the latest inform on the district economi or data on the nation economi that give me undu concern about prospect for sustain econom growth   turn first to the district   as is frequent the case  overal it is perform much like the nation economi   the expans is broad base  employ is author for public releas   of     grow  while the usual labor market churn continu   sector such as manufactur  mine  and energi are particular strong at this point   some job skill  particular in health care  account and audit  technolog  and the energi sector  are in short suppli   consum spend overal is well maintain  and nonresidenti construct activ appear to be improv  hous activ is a littl more difficult to summar   construct remain strong  sale are still relat substanti  as best i can determin  and inventori of unsold properti are rise as well  turn to the nation economi  i said earlier i wasn   t particular concern about the outlook  but i realli should put it more posit   it seem to me that the current state of the nation economi and it prospect are both quit good at this point  consist with growth this year of     percent or perhap even more   i   m impress by the employ gain that we   ve seen  sustain incom gain  and so on  and remind myself and other that  as the     s and     s demonstr  the economi is certain capabl of long period of uninterrupt expans  i thought i would comment a bit more on two issu in particular   one is hous   where i wonder if the signific of potenti develop might not be be exagger a bit   i certain agre that chang in hous price  up or down  feed into household wealth and through that into consum spend   i think that   s a perfect accept stori   so if hous price go down or level off  they will have that effect on wealth and potenti on spend   but there seem to be a view that  in some sens  an exogen pronounc declin in hous price is possibl  mayb even like  and that this could be more devast for the economi   it   s not that i would quibbl with that stori  but i would wonder about it likelihood becaus it seem to me more like that hous is the tail rather than the dog in this   that is  as long as employ continu to go up  incom continu to go up  and mortgag rate remain relat moder  then i would expect that we would avoid sever difficulti in hous except for a few market that are particular author for public releas   of     inflat at this point   put it the other way around  onli if overal econom condit deterior  with employ declin and incom growth slow or declin and so forth  would i expect there to be more broad base and more sever problem in hous  the second issu i   d like to spend a littl  e on is the inflat outlook   the question i ask myself is  how like is an appreci acceler of inflat at this point  particular in light of the step we have taken to get the feder fund rate back to a reason rang   first  i would argu that inflat expect remain veri well anchor at this point   i don   t hear  as i go around and talk to various group and meet with various busi peopl  ani doubt among the particip about the fed   s ongo commit to low inflat   and i think most of the avail data support that   one of the thing i was look at was a chart of one   five   and ten year rate of core pce inflat   and when you look at that  you see that the ten year rate of inflat has been declin steadili and now is a littl below   percent   the five year rate has basic the same pattern   it level off in about       but it  too  is a littl below   percent   and  of cours  the one year rate of inflat  although it bounc around a lot more  end up at about the same place  also a littl below   percent   and i just don   t have a sens that there has been ani unhing of inflationari expect at this point  anoth topic that i would comment on onli briefli is the issu of lag in polici   that is  presum the full effect of the action we   ve alreadi taken have not yet been felt  final  we have look at some forecast equat that tri to incorpor the growth in the money suppli in particular and to forecast core pce inflat   i wouldn   t claim a lot for the qualiti of these equat   i wish i could  but i can   t   but for the most part  these various equat provid forecast that are veri close to the  book forecast   inflat might be a littl lower this year or might be a littl higher this year  but they show veri small chang for the most part   my author for public releas   of     view is that the  book inflat forecast is a pretti good one   like presid    i origin submit a number of     percent for inflat this year  and i don   t see ani reason to chang it at this point   thank you
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   the momentum in the fourth district economi appear to be broad similar to the rest of the countri   s   the region appear to be expand at a good but not spectacular pace   although my district never experienc the extrem acceler in hous activ seen in mani other part of the countri  we are nonetheless see some downturn in residenti activ relat to last year   and  of cours  we are be affect by the shift fortun in the auto industri   the further we move into the year  the more op ist busi peopl seem to be about the outlook   the soft in last year   s fourth quarter is now all but forgotten   busi leader in the district are stick with strong capit spend plan  and i   ve been get especi posit report on commerci construct  turn to the nation economi  the  book baselin captur the broad contour of my own expect   name  a slow in person consumpt spend and  as mani other have comment  in the hous sector over the cours of the year  lead the overal economi back toward a moder but solid growth path next year  as for the outlook on price  i am still predict that headlin inflat will shift down this year from last year   s energi shock pace and move much closer to the center of my prefer rang   overal  i realli am not see a lot in the way of warn sign that inflationari pressur are build   i get sporad report of labor market tight  a point to which i   ll return in a minut  but i hear just as mani report highlight the moder of energi cost  especi for natur gas   the headlin and ex food and energi cpi inflat for februari were quit favor and were author for public releas   of     certain interpret as such by financi market   and  import  inflat expect do appear to be well contain   like other  in cleveland we typic monitor the ten year tip spread  and those certain have not been give me ani caus for alarm   despit this  i get a sens from busi contact that the full pass through of energi and materi cost into final good price may not yet be complet   consequ  the arc of my outlook is quit similar to that of the  book   some slight tick up in core inflat this year as a whole  with core measur move down to more desir level in       as i turn to the risk to the outlook  i tri to think of those place where my staff   s analysi or the comment that i hear from my busi contact seem most at odd with the  book project   if there is one area of some disagr  it would be the degre to which the  book seem to emphas potenti increas in labor cost as a sourc of upward price pressur in the near term   consist with the  book assess  i am hear  for the first  e in year  report of some tighten in labor market and some acceler wage growth  howev  to echo your theme  mr  chairman  the job vacanc and wage pressur do appear to be concentr in a small number of high skill occup   my list is veri similar to presid     s   in truth  i have to work pretti hard to get my busi contact to talk about their concern about acceler wage cost   and i fear just a littl that my interrog may be forc confess from the innoc    laughter   at the same  e  my busi contact are still op ist about their abil to generat solid product gain   although i do expect to see some continu pass through of previous shock to core measur of inflat  these influenc are expect to dissip over the cours of the year  when i add up all of these piec  i don   t see much evid that capac constraint are like to drive up price and wage pressur   what i don   t know  of cours  is whether the report author for public releas   of     that i   m get are peculiar to the fourth district   when i look at the employ cost data over the past sever quarter  they seem consist with a relat benign wage cost pictur   but i heard from a few of my colleagu ahead of me that they are see a differ pictur   i am interest in whether these anecdot impress that i   m get are just a fourth district peculiar or whether they   re spread more broad   thank you  mr  chairman
you mention nonresidenti construct  and presid   mention that   i think the  book was pretti pessimist about the near term prospect for nonresidenti construct   is there some disson there    laughter
well  in fact  we   re forecast a recoveri   we   ve been forecast a recoveri for the last year and a half that hasn   t happen yet   i actual don   t view us as be terribl pessimist in that regard   we   re forecast an upturn after a long period of disappoint  sluggish perform on that side   so i guess i   d character our forecast as somewhat op ist relat to where we   ve been over the past two year
do you count state and local construct in that     that come in nonresidenti or in state and local spend
that   s actual in state and local construct spend   it   s a differ compon
becaus that  i would think  has the potenti to be pretti strong  given the tax collect and so forth
actual  it has been an area that has improv as well   so the one part in which we haven   t seen much yet has been the offic build side   and that is an area where our forecast improv  so i was actual a bit reliev to hear of some crane out there   laughter  author for public releas   of
i was just go to add to that      for so mani month i was hear about some increas construct in health care facil and school build   but in the past few month it has been broader than that   it has been offic build and some plant
mr  chairman  in term of what we see outsid our window at our feder reserv bank  it is almost all condominium construct   the joke is that you want to be the fourth owner of the build that is be construct
thank you  mr  chairman   a coupl of thing  first  on the region   like the nation  our region continu to grow at a fair robust pace   but one of the question we kept ask in our discuss was whether it was strong but level out  or acceler   i think  for the most part  the consensus is that it   s strong but level out   turn to just a coupl of exampl  manufactur activ did expand in februari and  we think  in march on a preliminari basi  but at a somewhat slower pace than in januari and even in decemb for us   product and new order rose onli modest in the februari and earli march period   hous activ  as other have discuss  has shown some sign of level off  although it is still high by histor standard  residenti construct has edg down in most area of our district  and builder to whom we   ve talk expect further eas in the month ahead   i think it is import  too  that home sale are show littl or no growth  with high end sale softer than most of the other segment in our market  just to mention commerci real estat  it has actual improv somewhat in our region  vacanc rate have continu to edg down in the denver and kansa citi area  so we have seen author for public releas   of     some pickup in activ   energi activ continu to expand veri rapid  despit shortag of labor and equip throughout the we n part of our region   in some of our rocki mountain communiti  concern has increas that the energi boom will drive away some of the other core busi becaus of the cost of labor  land  and hous   it is realli a boom environ there  i will talk quick about inflat in our area   wage pressur  in fact  remain most subdu   we have seen some backdown in wholesal price  although retail price have edg up  manufactur report to us somewhat slower growth in raw materi price so far this year compar with last year   howev  i would say they are also concern that they cannot pass price increas on as they work through the process  let me just say one thing on the auto industri in our region   i talk with one of the largest retail dealer in the region  in denver   actual  he goe into texa and some other area   he told me that in just the first two week of march they   ve seen a general slowdown in some demand for their product  both domest and foreign   but he said that  obvious  the domest market is realli suffer great   in fact  he has seen other dealer refus to take inventori from the domest auto dealer  which give him real concern about that industri go forward  turn quick to the nation outlook  i agre that  for the most part  it is veri posit   i think that in the first quarter  mayb the first half  we will see a strong gdp number  perhap as high as the  book has indic or even higher  which will then move back down toward the trend rate of growth over the cours of the year   like presid  n  i think part of this in the first quarter and first half is reflect of a coupl of thing   one is the bounceback from the year end  anoth is the last effect of accommod polici that we had in the previous year  becaus a lot of money is still search to be deploy right now but is begin to be use up   and for the first  e in a while  i   ve heard more and more busi talk about the prime rate   i haven   t heard that author for public releas   of     in four year   they are much more sensit to it   they   ve seen it go up  and now they   re negoti around that  which i think tell you that some of the catch up in term of the polici effect of our past move has begun  and i think you   ll see more of it in the come month and quarter
thank you   a number of peopl have talk about tighten monetari condit   presid   did   of cours  long term rate have not risen  so i guess there is a question here about the issu of how much is the term premium  how much is the chang in the equilibrium rate   i just put that question on the tabl becaus your view on it should affect whether you think condit are essenti easi or tighten   first vice presid stone
thank you  mr  chairman  and welcom back   and welcom to the new governor   first  i   d like to make a coupl of comment on the region befor i talk about the nation economi   the third district didn   t see a fourth quarter as weak as the nation economi  nor is our first quarter as strong   but we   re see solid growth  which our indic tell us will continu at current rate for the forese futur  payrol employ is a particular issu in our district   with the benchmark revis that were made  our employ growth has been stronger than we origin es    our three state unemploy rate fell to     percent

becaus of the lack of qualifi applic   that   s an increas from    percent when we ask that question two year ago   firm report the greatest difficulti in find product worker and comput savvi employe  but i would go on to point out that one of our director  who head a temporari author for public releas   of     employ agenc  has been report for the past two year a continu difficulti in find worker with even limit skill to deploy  manufactur in our area continu to expand at a moder pace   after a temporari dip in januari  the index in our survey has rebound to the level consist with last summer  and that level is consist with moder expans in activ  retail sale in our district are rise onli modest  but retail tell us that weak in februari were weather relat and that they expect a pickup in april   demand for nonresidenti offic space in the district is grow  and that   s unusu for our market   the offic market absorpt rate is rise in the philadelphia metropolitan area  and the offic vacanc rate is declin in both the citi and the suburb   we had some offic build in the last coupl of year  which is the first offic build we   ve had in downtown philadelphia in a decad   we are see a few sign of modest slowdown in hous market  with permit  home sale  and mortgag lend soften in recent month  final  we have receiv some further welcom news of moder in price pressur in the district   our manufactur    survey measur of price receiv and price paid have fallen sharpli over the past two month   expect of futur price increas remain subdu  and sever respond told us that  in their view  input price pressur have settl down and that their inflat concern have subsid  turn to the nation economi  our econom outlook is broad consist with the  book baselin   all sign point to a strong rebound of growth this quarter  after the temporari weak in the fourth quarter   employ  busi spend  and manufactur remain strong  and consum spend continu to increas at a solid pace   there are emerg sign that the hous market is begin to cool off  but no sign of a sharp retrench at this point   the author for public releas   of     econom fundament remain solid  and after the rebound this quarter  we expect growth to settl down to a rang of   percent to     percent  near potenti growth   the economi is expect to remain near full employ  with labor market tight   we expect hour compens growth to acceler somewhat over the forecast period  but not dramat  now  in my view  the risk to growth are rough balanc   a sharper declin in the hous market than that built into our forecast pose some downsid risk  but it   s also possibl that hous will not turn down as much as or as soon as forecast   the extent to which we see an improv or further deterior in export is anoth risk that could go either way   in fact  there appear to be a consider diverg of view on the path of net export among privat sector forecast  in my view  the inflat risk are tilt somewhat to the upsid   it   s true that the data on core inflat and inflat expect and our own recent declin in survey measur of price paid and receiv are encourag   the acceler of core inflat at the end of      has been revers in the first month of        so far  firm have had a remark abil to absorb cost shock via new found product gain  and increas global competit has limit their price power   both have help keep inflat in check   on the other hand  oil price remain at high level and continu to be volatil   the abil of firm to maintain low pass through in the presenc of continu higher cost is a question   with inflat run near the top of the rang that i consid consist with price stabil and with the economi oper at high level of resourc util  there is a risk that strong inflat pressur could emerg   sever  e in the past we have seen core inflat quick rise by a sizabl amount when the economi was oper at high level of resourc util follow period of accommod monetari polici  even when oil price did not rise sharpli   so in my view  the inflat risk remain at least moder on the author for public releas   of     upsid  even though the recent data have been benign   that said  on the whole i think the economi and the econom outlook are veri posit   thank you
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   while we had some softer read on our district   s econom perform earli in the year  recent measur have been notic stronger  our survey result from march have come in sinc the beig book  and they show continu strength in servic sector revenu growth  along with a sharp rebound in shipment  new order  and employ for the manufactur sector   the retail sector  in contrast  has been weaker in februari and march   some of the weak is in furnitur and may reflect cool hous market   howev  other retail suggest that they are still experienc giveback follow the extraordinari sale growth they saw in januari  and mani remain op ist about sale prospect go forward  sever district busi we talk to plan to increas invest in the month ahead  their plan includ not onli comput and technolog but also factori machineri   labor market in our district seem to be get tighter   in januari  districtwid unemploy stood at     percent  and we hear scatter report of shortag of skill worker  as you mention earlier  along with some complaint that worker shortag are constrain product   i had heard occasion refer to worker shortag in past month  go back into last year  but this chatter has pick up notic in recent week   not onli have the number of report increas somewhat  but some now come from outsid the tradit strong urban area   we   re hear it now in the manufactur depend  ina  for exampl  price growth measur moder in our march survey result   district busi report that input price increas slow  but they continu to express concern about futur cost pressur  author for public releas   of     our respond also report slower growth in their output price  and this was broad base across all sector we survey   in addit  expect price increas for the next six month general lessen  our region econom indic on product  employ  and price pressur seem broad consist with the nation pictur   the data point to a strong rebound in gdp growth this quarter  perhap stronger than had been anticip by the  book and privat forecast  while household residenti invest is slow  busi invest and spend appear to be strong  suggest that firm are ad to capac in anticip of healthi demand growth   the prospect for incom growth  driven by continu employ gain and respect growth in compens  give me some confid that overal consum spend should hold up well  even as hous market activ moder  inflat has come in a bit lower than expect  and i   m increas comfort with the idea that we   ve gotten beyond the risk to inflat present by the shock associ with last year   s hurrican and run up in energi price   core pce inflat averag     percent from august through novemb but has averag     percent from novemb through januari  although market base measur of longer run inflat expect rose briefli last fall  they soon subsid and have remain steadi sinc   so while i   m not entir sanguin about the inflat outlook  i think the immedi risk of pass through has probabl pass us by  look back over this episod  and how we and mani other fear that thing might have unfold  i think it illustr the challeng we face in tri to understand inflat dynam   as energi price rose sharpli last fall after the hurrican  the fear was that a sustain increas in core inflat and inflat expect would work it way through the economi in the first half of        this bulg now appear to have been small and short live  author for public releas   of     a common approach to forecast the effect of energi price shock on core inflat is to reli on relationship es  over histor period that includ seem similar episod   such an exercis implicit treat the empir relationship between energi price and core inflat as structur  as in model in which wage or price are set in a backward look fashion   but as presid   and other have emphas  this relationship is not stabl in the histor data   it has larg disappear sinc the late     s   this underscor the pitfal of forecast inflat base on a backward look approach that reli on pass through correl or  for that matter  phillip curv correl between measur of slack and inflat   in contrast  to the extent that price set is forward look  these correl must emb expect regard our polici behavior and so will not general be stabl across chang polici regim  this perspect suggest that the limit magnitud of the pass through from last fall   s energi price shock was influenc by the public   s confid that we would focus on prevent broader inflationari spillov   in other word  we may have gotten less pass through than we fear becaus we were more credibl than we realiz  and the public   s behavior was more forward look than we thought  again  this is not to say that i   m complac about inflat   the initi respons to last fall   s shock embodi expect of a lower path for the fund rate and a greater rise in inflat  fortun  the combin of communic by fomc particip and the committe   s steadi action appear to have brought these expect back in line  i bring all of this up becaus in the month ahead we are like to see tighter resourc util if the  book is correct  and we will be concern about the extent to which that would put upward pressur on inflat and inflat expect   so the question of the extent to author for public releas   of     which inflat dynam are backward look or forward look is go to be front and center for us
and yet our behavior has to be consist with the model  right   we have to respond in a way that    in fact  react to inflationari pressur
that   s right   it   s just that i   m alway struck in episod like this at the difficulti of take advantag of histor correl without take a strong stand on how the public expect us to conduct polici
i   ll agre   vice chairman
thank you  mr  chairman   like all of you  we think the under trajectori of demand and inflat seem quit favor  perhap a bit more so than it did in januari   we expect real gdp to grow at a rate slight abov the rate of increas potenti in       and to slow to the rang of potenti in         we expect the core pce to rise at a rate in the neighborhood of   percent over the forecast period   differ between our forecast and the  book   s are minor   in our forecast  we assum that inflat expect remain anchor and the term premium remain low and that we are now at a point where littl or no resourc slack is left in the domest economi  the monetari polici assumpt we adopt is the path current price into the futur market   the major sourc of uncertainti in our forecast are the size of the wealth effect we might see accompani ani slowdown of hous  the flexibl of profit margin  and the sustain of this present configur of low risk premium   we view the risk to the growth forecast as rough balanc  although the usual suspect provid a sourc of concern   the risk to our inflat forecast  in contrast  still seem slight tilt to the upsid  author for public releas   of     on the growth front  as i said  we think the under pace of demand growth is pretti strong  and we don   t see ani sign yet that would point to evid of a signific slowdown relat to potenti in prospect   we think product growth is like to remain quit high  rise perhap a bit fa  this year than in         with the labor market grow on trend and some increas in labor   s share of nation incom  we expect consumpt growth to remain reason strong  stronger incom growth offset the expect deceler in hous price appreci and the effect that might have on consumpt   we expect a slight increas in the contribut of busi fix invest to demand growth  due princip to a rise in spend on equip and softwar   we expect  of cours  the contribut of residenti invest to slow with the forecast period   world gdp growth seem stronger and more broad base   we expect net export to be a persist drag  shave about    percentag point off growth for each of the next two year  despit this forecast of pretti strong spend growth and high level of resourc util  we believ core inflat is like to remain moder   under the assumpt of a relat stabl dollar and with the energi price assumpt taken from the futur curv  we expect headlin inflat to slow to a rate closer to the core over the forecast period   but this forecast rest on three import foundat   the first is that we succeed in keep inflat expect reason well anchor   the second is that demand growth not onli   not acceler to a rate substanti abov trend but also slow to potenti over the forecast period   and the third is that the expect rise in compens and unit labor cost result in a rise in labor share of incom   in other word  that compens growth acceler but the increas is absorb by some compress of profit margin and   not lead to a signific acceler in core inflat  now  the sourc of potenti upsid risk to the inflat forecast are sever   one  of cours  come from the interact between our view about product growth  compens  author for public releas   of     and profit margin   if the pace of product growth slow signific relat to our assumpt and if  at the same  e  condit in labor market continu to improv  unit labor cost are then like to acceler   a rise in compens  howev  would not by itself portend a troubl increas in core inflat   the extent of this risk  as i said  depend on the degre to which rise unit labor cost are absorb in shrink profit margin rather than trigger output price increas as firm attempt to defend exist margin   and becaus the labor share of incom seem somewhat low and  as histor averag suggest  there   s room for unit labor cost growth to be absorb in profit margin rather than caus price increas  we need to be attent to the risk that this process may produc a short term increas in core inflat  perhap also in inflat expect  a second potenti risk come from what we think we know about the pace of demand relat to potenti suppli global   a continu increas in commod price around the globe and  more recent  some modest increas in capit good price may suggest that global pressur on resourc constraint are push up price   this rais the risk that the recent weak in core good price in the unit state may not be sustain   servic price inflat in the unit state has shown sign of slow  our central forecast  as i said  is condit on littl movement in the dollar over the forecast period  but ani sizabl depreci of the dollar would still carri the risk of some acceler in core good price  for near two year  overal inflat  as what is measur by the pce or the cpi would suggest  has been run substanti abov core  and this is true for a rang of altern measur of under inflat   if the under inflat rate were closer to     percent than to   percent  we might view these potenti sourc of upward pressur with more equanim  author for public releas   of     although the probabl seem low that these forc will act to produc a signific acceler of core inflat or a signific deterior in inflat expect  we need to be care about those risk   so with under inflat at the upper end of the infer inflat prefer of the committe  we need to be more attent to these risk  on the growth side  the most obvious sourc of downsid risk to growth are a substanti rise in energi price from current level  a slowdown in product growth  a sharp rise in risk premium  and a more advers effect on save and consumpt from the expect adjust in hous market and price   like the staff forecast  we think it   s reason to expect household save to rise a bit and consumpt growth to slow  in part becaus of chang expect about the pace of futur appreci in the valu of home equiti   but we believ that  absent some larg  negat shock to percept about employ and earn incom  the effect of the expect cool in hous price are go to be modest   of cours  this view may prove op ist   we take some reassur from the fact that the averag growth forecast in the privat sector probabl anticip a signific cool in hous and a signific effect of that cool on save and consumpt  develop in asset price and risk premium over the past sever month seem to support this pictur of stronger confid in the growth and inflat outlook becaus real rate seem to have risen   equiti price and credit spread suggest consider confid in the prospect for growth   impli volatil remain quit low   we don   t know how much of this is fundament and how much will prove ephemer   at the moment  though  overal financi condit seem pretti support of the expans  so with this forecast of growth in the vicin of potenti  core inflat at around   percent  and the risk somewhat to the upsid for inflat  we think the princip respons of monetari author for public releas   of     polici remain to preserv the sens that we will act to keep long term inflat expect contain at level consist with price stabil
anyth to report on co op price in manhattan    laughter
as in mani case  i am not sure what you can take from the anecdot  but i guess some peopl say that you see a littl of the froth dissip   but i don   t think the adjust is acut   if you see hire at the new york fed go up substanti in the market  that will be a good lead indic of hous price revert somewhat    laughter
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   overal  i agre with mani of you around the tabl and with the  book   i see that you have solid growth go forward   i want first to talk about the corpor sector and then to talk a bit about the household sector  i have talk with sever corpor cfos in the past coupl of week  and i also just receiv a copi of the duke quarter cfo survey   i found the comment from the cfos and the survey result to be similar  and so i thought i would just use the duke survey to make my comment here   the cfos are expect to be abl to rais price more over this come year than they did last year   on averag  they are expect an increas in price of about     percent   a year ago at this  e  the quarter survey show a   percent increas   so the increas is slight   and they are also expect to rais wage and salari fa       percent this come year   their biggest concern continu to be global competit and health care cost   that has not chang at all  what i find realli amaz is how much these cfos continu to be focus on cash level  right now  as you know  the liquid asset on the balanc sheet of corpor are at the highest level in at least forti five year   corpor profit margin relat to gdp are run at    percent  author for public releas   of     and that is again a record level   if you look at the survey result  the cfos are say that they plan to increas cash even more in        how are they go to do that  one of the thing this group is forecast this year is for earn to grow      percent  last march the survey said        so the project for earn growth is up about   point   they are not expect top line revenu growth of    percent   they are expect to be abl to widen their oper margin   so the trend we have been see are what everybodi is just build on  this inertia and this new focus on cost manag seem to be central to what is go on in corpor america   part  too  they are worri about top line revenu growth  and i am hear more of them talk about use merger to widen their oper margin   grow market share through acquisit  get immedi revenu pop  pull out the extra cost  and get the bottom line growth at    percent that way   they also are plan to spend more on capit expenditur this year  up     percent versus     percent  and also much more employ growth    percent versus       so they are op ist  but again  the focus on widen oper margin from alreadi histor wide level and on build liquid asset show that a real focus on the fundament in corpor america is continu  if you look at the survey of small busi  you can read the same kind of trend in the respons   the op  of small busi remain at a veri high level   so  in summari  i think corpor america is go to continu to push earn growth and product but is clear focus on cost contain   and while they may be look at rais price a bit  i think overal price will be contain  now  a look at the household sector   what i have been notic in the past few month is that job growth  as mani of you have mention  has clear gotten a lot stronger and also that wage are grow much fa    in the last three month  they have gone up at an annual rate of     author for public releas   of     percent  which is pretti strong   i think we have to go back about four or five year to get that kind of increas  so the real question  as mani of you have said  is what is realli happen to product  the last  e we had this kind of wage growth was in the late      s  and we saw the pop in product   so unit labor cost were there and help modifi inflat   i heard from the cfos that this is exact what they are tri to do   to find way to improv product just so they can handl the higher wage cost becaus they are find that skill are short in some area   but the high skill peopl are probabl also more product  on averag  than other folk who may be look for job  and hire the more product worker could also help in that way  i think that the good job growth and the fa  wage increas will also help put a floor on hous sale   you know i have been concern about where we are in term of the mortgag market go forward in support of hous   we know that the fix oblig ratio that our staff construct has been at record level  last quarter it show a tick down in the fourth quarter  but it still is relat high   mortgag rate on the long end have not realli move veri much in the last coupl of year   but to the extent that so mani new mortgag were financ with adjust rate mortgag in the last year and the arm rate spread now has realli move up as we have move short rate up  there is less than a point differ now between one year arm and the term rate  so afford  i think  is go to continu to come under more pressur go forward  hous inventori are increas   again  i talk to a cfo at a larg builder   they clear are manag inventori much better than they did year ago  but even so  backout on sale and such thing are increas   the number of hous start that they have in train and start go forward are go to be slow down  and they are give guidanc to the street that they   re not author for public releas   of     go to get the sale that they had   but even if it slow down  hous is still go to be veri strong in relat to histor standard  but it will be off the peak that we have been see  final  to follow up on the comment that some of you made  i see that we still have a tremend amount of liquid in the financi market   again  corpor are sit on all this liquid   we do not hear anyth from corpor about difficulti in financ big or small busi   we know the banker clear are look for loan growth and tri to find it  and the hous market is abl to attract all the liquid it need   so in term of how effect our rate increas have been  i see that the lag effect is still there and that plenti of liquid is still out there  which keep me focus on where core inflat will be
do you relat the corpor prefer for cash to caution  to risk avers  and what implic would that have for capit invest
i would say that  until about six month ago  most of it was risk avers  corpor were not sure what their plan were go to be   they did not know how they were go to get earn growth  and so i think some was a precautionari kind of save   they clear deploy most of it into restructur their balanc sheet  refinanc  and get corpor leverag down   a number of them use some of the cash  play the account game of put it into pension fund and book a higher yield on the pension than they could in short term invest in equip and softwar   but i am begin to hear that they are more like to loosen the string and have more cash go forward  anoth interest thing i heard from one cfo  although somebodi just mention the danger of anecdot  is that they are put more of what they call    invest    in human resourc train and develop than in equip becaus they see that  if they cannot hire the peopl author for public releas   of     with skill  they have to develop the skill of the good employe they have   we do not captur that  but it may be one of the way they are use the cash flow
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   sinc the last meet  as mani of us have remark  we have seen stronger domest demand and a littl less core inflat than expect   to a degre  this extend a pattern   in look at the  book chart on the evolut of the staff forecast  i was struck by the steadi upward drift sinc last fall of project growth in      and       coupl with flat to downward movement in project inflat for those year   now  much of the      growth was shift from       but the unemploy rate at the end of this year and next is lower than it was project last fall   without ani more  and mayb even a littl less  price pressur project  one possibl is that we are see a smaller effect from higher energi price than anticip  at least on inflat and perhap on demand as well   sinc we expect the effect of energi price on growth rate of output and core price to be temporari in ani case  this sort of inform should not deflect us from our under view that growth is in the process of slow to trend  hold under inflat rough stabl  the cool of the hous market is the main impetus for a slight moder in growth   in this regard  although the incom data on hous have been distort by unusu weather and subject to consider nois  i judg them on balanc to lend ad support to the sens that activ and price increas are soften  albeit to an unknown extent   i agre with presid  n that an order cool of these market with moder effect on growth is the most like outcom  but we just do not know yet   rise inventori  declin new home sale  downward movement in build permit  and a drop in mortgag applic   all point to an appreci drop off in the author for public releas   of     demand for hous   in the staff forecast  residenti construct flatten out this year and next  after contribut near half a point to gdp growth last year   logic  softer demand should also be reflect in price   unfortun  data for price are even harder to read than those for activ  but the recent month inform on exist and new home price seem consist with the march slowdown in the rate of increas of these price  which should feed through to wealth and consumpt   and we probabl haven   t seen the full effect of the rise in short term interest rate on hous demand  particular for those who are liquid or incom constrain   mortgag rate have also pick up somewhat this year  and they are at the upper end of the rang they have been in for the past sever year   so we could see some of the long term mortgag rate effect as well  it is possibl  of cours  that the damp influenc of the hous market could be offset by greater strength elsewher  and two logic contend are export spark by stronger growth abroad and busi invest   we have seen anoth in the seri of upward revis to foreign growth in the current  book  but we have also seen greater tighten of monetari polici get built into financi market  offset some of the increas in the strength of demand abroad  moreov  the dollar has risen on balanc  reduc the feed through of higher demand abroad to purchas from u s  produc   busi invest look robust  albeit a littl less so after friday   s data on order and shipment   if hous take someth out of consumpt  howev  prospect sale growth will not be quit so strong  and this will constrain the increas in invest demand  so  on balanc  i see a moder of growth to around the rate of increas in potenti as a reason expect  given the structur of interest rate built into market   the key question is whether such a path for output will be consist with low  stabl inflat  author for public releas   of     i think we can be encourag by the recent data on price and compens   core consum and inflat measur have been flat or declin on a twelv month basi over the last six month or so  despit the uptrend in energi price   and inflat expect have remain quit stabl on balanc   compens measur are a bit more mix   the broadest measur  eci and total compens  have not pick up despit the eros of purchas power impli by higher energi price and despit good trend product growth   in this regard  mr  chairman  we do see an increas in averag hour earn of nonsupervisori worker   mayb we are begin to see some of this feed through to worker on the lower end of those wage   but  overal  i think compens growth has been veri well behav  to be sure  we have not yet seen the effect of the recent increas in resourc util  declin in the unemploy rate  or rise in capac util   and these feed through to inflat pressur with pretti long live   given the flat of the phillip curv  it could take some  e to perceiv the inflationari effect if  inde  the economi is oper beyond it sustain potenti   moreov  the staff is look for a notabl pickup in compens   the unit labor cost this year and next are part absorb by smaller markup   at this point  howev  given the recent data  i would judg these potenti develop to weigh on the side of upsid risk to inflat rather than tilt the most like outcom  both compens and price increas have fallen short of model project in recent quarter   while the less than expect effect of energi price could explain this more favor relationship of output and inflat  we can   t reject the hypothesi that we are see someth more fundament develop  especi on the suppli side of the economi   recent data suggest it is not an unexpect increas in product   some combin of the lower nairu and the anchor inflat expect altern simul in the  book or other factor could be author for public releas   of     hold down wage and price   it is far too soon to say whether anyth is go on or to teas out the polici implic  but we would do well to rememb just how wide those confid interv are  how littl we know about price and output determin  and especi how littl we know about the level and growth rate of potenti gdp   thank you  mr  chairman

okay   mr  chairman  it is a great delight to see a     percent increas in the number of beard around this tabl    laughter   half of that was in my point forecast  and the other half was not    laughter  the contact that i   ve talk to recent are veri op ist about activ   with one except  which i   ll start with   my contact at a major truck firm said that he see what he call a littl bit of a slowdown   volum is essenti flat year over year across all region and product  he  sn   t have an explan  but he   s the onli one of my contact who had anyth negat to say about the situat  my contact at up had some interest comment   he said that both up and fedex togeth have their network oper at a higher level at this  e of year than they have ever seen and that  at the fourth quarter peak  they will not be abl to meet demand without some new strategi   in particular  they   re go to use price and incent  i guess  to tri to reduc some demand that is less profit   they will be work with custom to ship stuff out on sunday that previous went on monday  that kind of thing   but he say that  unless they do that sort of thing  he anticip that they will be unabl to meet demand in the fourth quarter   of cours  they talk with their custom all the  e  and they   re veri op ist   they have had veri good earn statement  as you may have seen  my contact with wal mart said someth that i thought was veri interest  which i   m go to tri to explor in more detail   he said that their wage  and these are for hour worker  possibl just for sale associ   are absolut flat   no increas whatsoev in the last year and author for public releas   of     no increas plan go forward   individu worker are get some increas  which probabl averag about   percent  as a consequ of senior   they have a pay scale by which worker are paid more after they have stay there some month   i don   t know exact how mani   and i think they also have some product or perform bonus built into their pay structur  but the structur has not chang at all  so wage are increas about   percent year over year   he said that about    percent of their associ are part  e and that they are go to be increas that share to    percent so they can staff at peak  e and get more product out of their workforc  on a nation basi  the main thing i   d like to comment on is construct  and i   ll start with a local stori   there is an absolut tremend boom in nonresidenti construct go on in st  loui   as a consequ of our own build project  we have close contact with the construct industri in st  loui  and our peopl receiv a spreadsheet list of project in the citi   i will start with the bottom line and give you some exampl of the kind of thing that is take place   the averag st  loui construct volum is      million to      million a year in nonresidenti construct   now  list in this tabl are multiyear project  some are two  and three year project  start last year and this year   the total here is        billion   it is probabl sever  e over the normal annual volum in st  loui   to give you some exampl  there   s      million worth of casino project  includ casino and some casino hotel   so we   re build casino   i guess in dalla they   re build condo
same thing    laughter
well  washington univers has      million worth of project  reconstruct of interst    through the citi is      million   a cement plant       million  is be built south of st  loui   there are hospit project that add up to about      million  wast water treatment plant       million  and a whole slew of other thing here   i do not think there   s author for public releas   of     anyth on this list that is multifamili hous   this is all nonresidenti   i have a suspicion that we have much stronger nonresidenti construct in the work than is visibl to us   if you think about our formal statist process  we do not realli pick up much of that in advanc  and i would recommend that the staff put togeth a special beig book survey next  e  tri to get an idea of what sort of contract or expect are out there   the architect know it   the compani all know it   but we don   t have that inform collat  and i think it might be veri help  i note also that the hous industri is veri visibl  and there are report almost daili of guess about soften in that industri   a lot of the resourc  such as cement and labor  are perfect interchang between residenti and nonresidenti construct   so we may find with the visibl of the hous industri that the market will read some signal of a soften economi in the construct area when  in fact  there is a tremend amount of    stealth strength    that we are not observ that is come from the nonresidenti side   i notic that in the monday pre fomc brief you had a special discuss of busi fix invest in general  and i think that was focus on equip and softwar and not on the construct side   but i   m guess that we have a lot more strength in the work than appear in front of us   my up contact said that they are expand their louisvill hub facil   let   s see what the total was   someth over a billion dollar that they are go to spend in expand their louisvill hub  i would say one other thing   on the inflat issu  firm don   t say veri much about their own price increas except when they have problem pass on cost increas   they may complain about some of the cost increas they   re see   we do not hear veri much of that   we hear a bit of it  particular regard fuel  and we still get health insur cost   except for that  we do not hear veri much  but i think we are go to have to ask veri explicit in order to extract from firm what they are do on their own price front becaus it is not someth that they author for public releas   of     natur volunt   all their own price increas  of cours  are fulli justifi and sensibl  and onli the cost increas that they are have troubl absorb are a problem that they would bring to our attent   thank you
the comment and suggest on nonresidenti construct is veri help  veri interest   on the wal mart wage increas of   percent   hasn   t wal mart increas health coverag and compens overal
yes  this is the straight hour wage   they do have some benefit cost increas   i think that  in their budget  they are expect     percent over the cours of this year  they have been chang the structur of their benefit program   and the other thing that my contact there said  although i didn   t talk to him about it this  e  is that they   re observ lower util   that is  appar they believ that a lot of the low wage demograph  as they put it  is somewhat stress   they see that in their own sale in term of the kind of thing that peopl are buy   they say that there is a lot of strength at the upper end of their demograph and weak at the lower end  but their own labor forc is use health care less intens than befor  perhap becaus of the pressur from absorb energi price increas and that sort of thing   so the copay that they are charg   the deduct   are enough to reduc the util   that is whi the outlay they are expect is up onli   percent   i am sure that the cost per unit deliv is rise more quick than that  but there is lower util
thank you   governor olson
thank you  mr  chairman   in prepar for today   s meet  i talk with the ceo of three bank   one major money center  one major east coast region bank  and one major west coast   that pretti well have the market cover   there have been  e when those convers have either been direct or substant at odd with  or mayb ahead of  our author for public releas   of      book and our prepar data  but not this  e   the convers pretti well corrobor or were consist with both the  book and our flow of fund data   they all report that  into        consum loan remain strong with good prospect for growth   asset qualiti remain veri good  abov level that histor experi would suggest they could maintain   interest  we had that messag a year ago  that asset qualiti was better than what they thought they could maintain through their normal credit review process  and that situat continu   commerci lend continu to be solid for both larg and small borrow  but the util of credit line still remain at about    percent   so it mean that we are move up from a veri soft commerci loan market and may  in fact  be consist with what presid pool suggest  this come back to a question that presid hoenig rais ye day   the market are much more concern with event risk than with inflat risk   which is to say  issu like major energi disrupt  terror activ  or even weather relat activ   this mean that risk avoid tend to be  to a signific extent  relat to geographi or market segment  two particular area struck my contact and  therefor  me as be unusu and worthi of comment   one of them relat to a signific chang in the market for initi public offer  and this particular came from the west coast   the expect for start up  particular tech start up  are much more stringent on the west coast   a coupl of year ago  a veri good idea could generat a signific ipo experi  but now a good idea plus five year of solid cash flow experi might result in half the level of an ipo that they would have had fair recent   the ventur capit side of the busi notic that veri signific chang   a start up today is much more like to end up be an acquisit candid than an ipo  and the reason for that may be vari   part of the reason might be caution  but a lot of it is be attribut to the addit regulatori burden  particular the sarban   oxley regulatori burden  author for public releas   of     in the money center  the liquid in the market is provid signific by the institut investor  and the activ on the loan side is to a great extent in structur credit   the collater loan oblig and the collater debt oblig are provid a lot of that activ   one signific chang that is sort of consist with the ipo experi is that  in mani case  intern activ busi are more apt to go offshor for either debt or equiti and do it as a privat placement rather than do it in the unit state   also  the bank that are activ intern can follow the flow either through a direct transact or through some sort of a collater arrang that can provid the financ  so an intern custom has a distinct advantag in do busi with an intern bank  an overal reflect on the economi   consum activ remain strong  but flatten of real estat equiti will certain restrain the wealth effect on consumpt to some extent   in the so call bubbl market  we are clear see price drop   in the mortgag busi  the purchas mortgag are veri activ  but refinanc are almost entir elimin   there is a signific dispar between u s  and offshor market in term of regulatori report requir  and that is becom increas appar and has becom a factor in both credit and equiti issuanc  notabl there is a signific absenc of concern express about inflationari pressur   none of the three ceo express concern that they are feel the effect of inflat   thank you
did the bank comment on the yield curv  is it affect them
we did not hear much comment   i expect to hear much on the yield curv  but i did not have ani specif comment
thank you   governor    author for public releas   of
thank you  mr  chairman  and thank you to everyon around the tabl   i think governor   and i share the view that peopl have been incred kind and support in teach us the way of this institut in the past week   so we certain appreci that   i know i do   the onli advic that i was given last night that i will not take is that they say that governor at their first meet should sing their open remark    laughter   i thought it was a joke  but i guess that we   ll test it here    laughter  allow me to offer just a few perspect consist  i think  with a lot of the discuss ye day and mayb some particular focus on busi invest   as was discuss  the economi appear to be stronger  but as i think about the economi today versus over the last sever period  what strike me is how much more well balanc it is than it was over recent period   the equiti market  the credit market  and certain the anecdot inform that i   ve glean in my sever week here and befor  all tend to confirm that view   and although there are meaning risk to the economi  my own view is that there is a greater upsid potenti for growth than express in the  book  a few note about the consum befor i spend the balanc of my  e on busi invest   first  the consum appear to be strong  as we discuss ye day   and my own sens is that  while there may well be soften in the residenti market  stagger repric of adjust rate mortgag and perhap potenti sale of a veri novel  new hous product   the thirti year fix rate mortgag    laughter  may simplifi thing  particular if the shape of the curv keep it current trajectori   second  i would expect there to be  as i think the  book referenc  acceler household incom growth and perhap new job creation more robust even than was describ in the  book  particular if some of the product gain that we have seen over the past sever year tend to moder  author for public releas   of     let me spend a few more moment now on the busi capit expenditur side   my own view is that the strength of busi capit expenditur in properti  plant  and equip may well surpris to the upsid   i think what we saw earlier in this recoveri  both anecdot as well as in the data  was a growth in cap ex by a lot of the small and medium size busi   and as one ceo said to me a coupl of week ago  big compani ceo have now gotten that memo  opportun to drive profit margin through product improv appear to be diminish somewhat  and so there appear to be a tendenc  a greater willing  to go back to the well and to get cap ex back up to speed   two obvious indicia of greater cap ex   which we   ve seen for some  e and that would have suggest to mani of us  includ me  that busi cap ex would have ramp up sooner   are  of cours  the strong corpor profit and these corpor balanc sheet that are in remark shape  what i would like to spend a littl  e on is  well  what is new   what is go to make cap ex grow over      abov and beyond the project to this point   and so  as i talk about two other catalyst  i would suggest that they are not realli reflect in the data yet   but my own sens is that we should see them or at least there is a greater probabl of see them in the balanc of the year   of cours  current regulatori and enforc issu are still consum signific ceo  e and signific director and offic  e  and that   tend to cast a rather deep shadow over these cap ex budget   what we are go to find in this proxi season is an occup or preoccup  both in the busi press and in some boardroom  with the ongo fight over major elect of director   there will be fight in boardroom  fight by institut sharehold  and a whole rang of op ed piec about how these director get put on board and whether the system should be reform   obvious  the current environ and the fight over author for public releas   of     sharehold democraci still tend to cast a bit of a shadow   so i guess the question realli is  what   s differ now  i would note two catalyst   one is ceo confid   i think governor bie ye day refer to this in a coupl of the survey   ceo confid   that look in their eye  their view of the anim spirit   appear to be back in stronger measur than i at least have heard in some  e  what then happen when ceo go into the boardroom  as i think most of my colleagu around the tabl know  is that they tend to generat some excit by director themselv   director are realli start  in some regard  to go back to basic   one ceo said to me about a week ago     be a board member is start to be fun again     and that is not someth this particular ceo  who is on a lot of larg cap board  would have said a year ago   i don   t think he was refer to the day of go to the golf cours in the middl of the board meet   what he meant by the board   s be fun again is that board member are focus on where the compani should be go   how should they be grow their busi   should they be more vest on the merger and acquisit side  should they be more focus on capit expenditur   and so from that ceo and from mani other  we are hear far fewer complaint about sarban   oxley   it   not mean that the complaint are not there  but my sens is that most of these compani have now been abl  at least  to put a box around their complianc burden   they have been abl to check that box  go through their     control onc or twice  and though they still do not like it  the burden is no longer consum their mind when they come to the boardroom  i think what we are go to see in the balanc of      are board member come back to board as    strateg advis     with a somewhat diminish role for board member as    complianc offic      and that is a good thing with respect to cap ex becaus the more they are focus on their busi  the more they are focus on help compani grow   i think that such focus is author for public releas   of     probabl increment quit posit to a decis about invest the next billion dollar in properti  plant  and equip   so look outward  i sens that compani are see bigger and bolder opportun  and that situat is a necessari precursor to understand whether or not these cap ex number increas  the second catalyst that i note may be a touch more controversi   how outsid are look at compani   i guess the way i would say it is not that the barbarian are back at the gate but that they are gather   when you look at the privat equiti world  the leverag buyout world  and the emerg hedg fund world  the    outsid    are now look at each other in a seri of allianc and are start to look with a keener eye toward corpor america   they probabl have seen the excess cash and  frank  the conservat of boardroom and the conservat of compani born in the past five year and are will to    think the unthink    and take greater advantag of that opportun  i think governor olson made refer to the ipo market  which is realli tell us mani of the same thing   whether a compani that is public has  all of a sudden  a new interest in go privat or an ipo candid is say     realli  what is in it for me   whi should i enter the capit market   might we make better use of our  e and attent by stay privat  by grow cash flow that way      anoth reason that the ipo market is not as robust as perhap it would have been in previous period like this relat to research   you have to be a veri big and veri bold compani to be get larg  bulg bracket firm write equiti research and explain your compani to a greater pool of sharehold   for an ipo candid or even for a public compani that has been around awhil with a few billion dollar market cap  get that kind of research and that sort of investor base is much harder to do than it was in the year befor sarban   oxley  author for public releas   of     anoth item i have consid is merger and acquisit backlog   the backlog that are on file by the largest invest bank and merger advis are bigger now than they have been in the past six year and mayb even befor that   the differ in the backlog this  e versus in previous year  i think  is how much is realli privat equiti   it look as though  in broad number  about a quarter to a third are privat equiti investor  lbo investor that are look at compani that  becaus of size or background  they would frank not have spent as much  e look at in year past   you have a rang of lbo player that are now back  and they are now describ themselv as sharehold activist and corpor govern expert   but twenti year ago they were there  and they were focus much as they are now on sharehold valu  so both the sign   from compani that are intern evalu their own boardroom dynam and from invest compani that are look to come to the gate and to take a coupl of these compani privat   remind us that compani have a perspect about their own cash that is either use it or lose it   and it would not surpris me to find some veri larg    blue chip    compani that feel either under attack or on the precipic of be attack tend to be bolder in their capit expenditur budget  what   s like to happen in the capit market should that all come to pass   one thing that may happen  and may be a first casualti  in the invest grade capit market is that some veri larg cap    blue chip    compani with except invest grade rate will all of a sudden find that they are in play by some lbo buyer and privat equiti particip   as you all well know  general in the invest grade market there has not been much of a chang of control premium in invest grade credit  unlik in the high yield market   but should a coupl of larg transact occur either here in the unit state or in europ  where a doubl a credit one day end up look more like a high yield credit the next  we might find that invest grade author for public releas   of     investor are ask for a greater premium in those market   i think all of this is a possibl as we think about       and         not a promis but a real possibl that we should continu to keep a keen eye on and evalu   as that dynam goe forward  we will have an earli signal tell us whether the cap ex number will come in larger than expect  final  with respect to inflat  i would add to some of the comment that the vice chairman made ye day by note that long term inflat expect as calcul in the tip market  while contain  are higher than ideal   and the market expect of potenti higher commod price and other materi input might also caus further pressur on inflat   as we as a committe approach our last step or our penul  step in possibl move rate  the market will be more and more focus on our own vigil with respect to those inflat expect  with that  i have finish
thank you   governor
i receiv the same advic that kevin did    sing     to dream the imposs         laughter
ani two hand intervent    laughter
obvious  from the remark that we heard earlier today and ye day  there is an enorm amount of strength and resili in the economi   clear  the economi has rebound from a temporari slowdown in the fourth quarter   the specif that i have heard from each of the district confirm the broad  book view that this is go to be a pretti strong quarter   i particular like the quotat from presid   that it will be    blow and go    dure this quarter   a forecast of    percent real gdp growth for      with perhap a bit of slow in      seem quit reason given the data that we have in hand   consumpt remain author for public releas   of     solid  and despit some less sanguin report at the end of last week about some order  busi invest still appear to be reason strong  sinc there seem to be much agreement with the central tendenc of the forecast  rather than review my reason for support it   and i support most of the reason that peopl put forward   what i want to do is focus on a few potenti risk factor go forward   not that i necessarili think that these thing are like to happen  but as dave   mention ye day  there are a number of uncertainti in the forecast  which we need to focus on   first  with respect to hous  second  with respect to energi and commod price  and  third  with respect to expect in the yield curv and the term premium issu that the chairman ask us about ye day  we have been receiv some mix signal with respect to the hous market  although the compon that tend to have the most inform for assess the futur direct of the market  permit and sale of new singl famili home  suggest some consider cool from the veri hot period in        the evid that i have from talk to properti develop in the chicago area and a bit in d c  seem to be consist with this evalu  particular in thing like the condo market   we see a lot of slow there  particular in the chicago area   at least from what i have heard anecdot   not onli are we face with the forecast   s typic dilemma of tri to predict a trend break or a turn point  but we also have relat few experi in the unit state over the last few decad of a downturn in the hous market   so the key concern is go to be the effect on wealth and on consumpt and obvious also on the construct market  in the  book  i believ the direct contribut of wealth to real pce growth was approxim   percent in       and the forecast is about   percent in       with at least half of each of these increment due to hous wealth   so  obvious  we have to be veri sensit to the author for public releas   of     concern there   in some countri  such as the unit kingdom and australia  even some relat moder downturn or slowdown in the hous market seem to have been associ with some fair import gdp effect  presid  n ye day made an import point of what   s drive what   mani of the discuss about the hous market suggest that there will be some sort of exogen shock that somehow may send the hous market down  as oppos to the hous market   s be part of the broader economi in which there are consumpt demand for invest and in which hous are an asset as part of a portfolio   it is import to put hous in that context   in the other countri where we have seen downturn and gdp effect  it is hard to pull out what part was due to hous   s lead as oppos to hous   s just be one of the factor affect by a general econom downturn   so with those caveat in mind  and obvious we have to be care about extrapol from other countri    experi  i do think we should be mind of the potenti risk that are there  second  energi and commod price   so far we have been veri fortun in see littl  if ani  of the run up in energi and commod price feed through to core measur of inflat  and from what i can tell in the discuss relat to the  book  this has been a bit of a surpris to the staff and a bit of a surpris to the committe   now  this may well be due to a confluenc of veri fortun factor that perhap could be revers in the near term  or it may be due to some longer run chang  which presid   discuss   we had some discuss of this ye day  so  as you know  product growth and intern competit could be import factor  but at this point i do not feel that i understand enough whether this situat is just temporari and we are lucki or whether it is part of an ongo process   and so i think we just have to be mind of the potenti risk there   and obvious with the uptick in forecast for growth outsid the unit author for public releas   of     state  which could be associ with an increas in demand for energi and raw materi  further upward pressur could be put on those price  final  inflat expect in the yield curv and term premium   fortun  general the market base and survey base measur of inflat seem to be fair steadi  reason well contain   i share kevin   s concern that some of these expect be abov         even in some case closer to   may be a bit of a challeng  but broad the number that we have been see around   seem to suggest that inflat expect are well anchor   and it seem that one of the great achiev of this bodi that i have now been veri fortun and veri honor to becom part of is the reduct of inflat uncertainti and the reduct of inflat expect  and these reduct  i think  help us at least in part to understand the veri low term premium that we have been see in the unit state  but we must also recogn that we have been see lower real and nomin rate and general lower term premium around the world   in talk to market particip  i hear much less of a fear of an inflat spike in mani countri around the world   not that there was a fear of an inflat spike in the unit state   but i think a greater certainti about the direct and focus of the fomc and a greater trust is extrem import  this get back to a point that presid   made ye day about the incred import role of expect   what we do has to be seen not just in term of the tradit backward look role of think about how the higher cost of capit could affect choic that peopl make  but also about our credibl in go forward   choic that we make may have opposit effect on interest rate than what we have seen in the past   rais interest rate in the short term may have a damp effect rather than an increas effect on longer rate  author for public releas   of     if you look to forecast of economist outsid this room and the system  you also see a fair amount of op   suggest growth in the futur   so the lower real and nomin rate in the longer term market do not seem to be due to concern about signific slow of the economi but to differ in view about inflat uncertainti and the level of inflat go forward   so  particular sinc some of our measur   of core pce  core cpi   are at or toward the upper end of the rang of where i would feel comfort  and  i believ  from what i have heard  a number of other around the tabl would feel comfort   we have to be vigil about that   maintain our credibl and the good work that this committe has done is someth that i want not to becom dream the imposs dream but someth that is the realiti and that we can continu   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   i would like now to summar these view and add a few comment of my own   at that point  if there are addit comment or question  they will be welcom  we have had  i think  a fair upbeat group here the last coupl of day  which is of cours good  both in term of view of econom activ and in term of keep inflat well control  the economi appear to be quit strong  but my sens is that most peopl feel that risk on that score are relat balanc  which i take to impli that  after be strong in this quarter  growth will slow to someth closer to a more sustain pace in the remaind of the year   perhap the lead sourc of uncertainti on the output side is the hous market  but i was reassur to hear that most particip think that a declin in hous will be cushion by strong fundament in term of incom  job  and continu low interest rate   the labor market is clear continu to strengthen  but i heard not too mani concern about increas wage pressur   there was some discuss about shortag of more high skill worker  which presum might affect wage at author for public releas   of     some point but appar has not so far  and there was addit discuss of product gain  which are help to keep unit labor cost down and to support growth  on the inflat side  i have not been in this convers for a while  but i was impress at least relat to a year ago that the angst about inflat seem to have declin   clear  inflat expect are well anchor   margin are high  and the sens of the group was that pass through to consum inflat was like to be limit   still  i took from the group some sens of at least a slight upsid risk to inflat  reflect the increas resourc util  the fact that inflat is somewhat on the high side of what mani peopl describ as their comfort zone  and the fact that  if inflat   rise  there will be cost to bring it back down and maintain our credibl  so that is my overal summari of the committe discuss   my own view  you will probabl not be surpris to hear  are not radic differ from what we have heard around the tabl   i would point out  first  that except for hous  the economi continu to be veri strong  one might be tempt to averag the expect rate of growth of the first quarter at about     percent with the     percent of the fourth quarter and say we   re at a pace of about   percent  but then i would remind you that we had     percent in the third quarter despit katrina and about     percent averag growth in the first three quarter of        we have a strengthen world economi   we have consumpt that look like to be well support by incom and job   sever peopl have talk about the strength of invest in nonresidenti construct   job creation at about         a month is clear abov the long run sustain rate   so except for hous   and that is  of cours  a critic sector   it look as though the economi is  if anyth  grow more quick than potenti  hous is the crucial issu   to get a soft land  we need some cool in hous   so far there is a good bit of evid that there has been a peak  but we do not know a great deal more than author for public releas   of     that   so obvious we are go to have to watch care   the rang of possibl outcom is quit wide   i agre with most of the commentari that the strong fundament support a relat soft land in hous   a pessimist might point out that the expect of futur price increas is itself an import part of the user cost of hous   a sea chang in peopl   s view about what is go to happen to hous price in the futur might signific affect their perceiv cost of own a hous and lead to lower price and to weaker activ   on the other side  residenti invest is  of cours  onli about   percent of gdp  and so long as consumpt is well maintain by incom  job  and other factor  i think it would take a veri strong declin in the hous market to substanti derail the strong momentum for growth that we are current see in the economi  what we might see in the next few quarter is some quarter to quarter variat   we may not have the stabil of growth that we have had the last coupl of year   if that happen  we should be will to accept it   i might offer a veri rough analog to the way we think about energi price and core inflat   with core inflat  our goal is to accommod energi price but to make sure that they do not get into the under rate of inflat   again  this might be a rough analog  but if the hous market move signific  we should perhap not tri to upset that movement but rather just tri to ensur that the resourc that are releas are deploy in the rest of the economi and that the rest of the economi remain on a stabl path   again  i think we are unlik to see growth be derail by the hous market  but i do want us to be prepar for some quarter to quarter fluctuat   so  broad speak  i agre with the committe that we should see some cool for the remaind of the year and that we should approach a more sustain pace of growth   but i think there is some upsid volatil risk  if you will  becaus of the fluctuat in residenti invest  author for public releas   of     on inflat  like most of you  i am struck by how well behav core inflat has been  inde  in       core inflat was even slight lower than it was in       and we have all point to a number of explan  includ well anchor inflat expect  intern competit  product growth  and sinc i wasn   t here  i can say good fed polici    laughter  one area of uncertainti in tri to look forward is unit labor cost   remark  unit labor cost in the nonfarm busi sector grew onli     percent in       but as was alreadi mention in the staff present  i think that underst the trend becaus it is come off the surg in the fourth quarter of       in bonus  stock option  and other type of one  e compens   if you smooth through that bulg  it look as though the under trend of unit labor cost is more like     percent  and perhap that may have some upward bias   there is certain a lot of uncertainti about that  though  we have seen some indic  such as averag hour earn  rise   other indic  such as the employ cost index  are slow   i just point this out as a signific sourc of uncertainti  given how difficult it is to forecast both compens and product go forward   so  again  the stabil of inflat in the last coupl of year is veri reassur  i would note  howev  that over the past three year  sinc       we have seen a pickup in inflat   that was  of cours  by design  but i think it is import for us to think about whi that happen   there   s someth of an identif problem here   to the extent that the increas in inflat over the last two to three year reflect the pass through of energi cost and commod price  that is actual good news in a sens becaus  to the extent that those factor soften and flatten in the come year  we should see some reduct in inflat in       and         to the extent that inflat increas in the last two and a half year reflect increas resourc util  the strength in the economi  and the return of price power  howev  there is a bit of concern that we may see some addit updrift of inflat in the next few quarter  author for public releas   of     like most of you  i am not at all alarmist about inflat   i think the worst that is like to happen would be    or    basi point over the next year   but even that amount is a littl disconcert for me   i think it is veri import for us to maintain our credibl on inflat and it would be somewhat expens to bring that addit inflat back down   so my bottom line on inflat is that there is a veri modest upsid risk   again  i think it   s not a larg risk but one that we probabl should pay attent to  are there ani comment or question to close our round on the econom outlook   if not  we can move to the polici round   in a moment i   m go to turn to   to introduc the polici option in the statement   befor i do that  i just want to note that we have left unresolv the discuss about the ownership of the statement   in particular  what we are vote on when we vote at the end of the meet   current we vote on the action  on the direct  and on the risk assess but not on the rational   the rational has  howev  been larg a consensus paragraph work out by the committe   my sens is that this decis is not entir separ from a wide rang of other issu we may want to talk about over the next few quarter concern the content of the statement  it structur  whether we use forward look languag  and whether we consid adopt some kind of numer guidepost for inflat  and so what i would like to do  if it is okay with the committe  is to maintain the status quo for today in term of our vote in this statement   by the next meet  in may  i will come back to the committe with a propos for a process by which we can address this whole rang of issu over a period of  e  and on the top of the agenda for that process will be the ownership of the statement   is that accept   all right   see assent  we will maintain the status quo on the statement just for today      whenev you are readi  author for public releas   of
low will be hand out some materi   market particip expect you to take anoth   point step today along the journey start in june        as can be seen in the top left panel of exhibit    the current march and april fed fund futur contract  plot as the first two observ along the black line  are consist with the fund rate target move up to    percent this afternoon  compar with what was expect just after your januari meet  the red line  financi price indic increas expect of an addit   point firm in come month  this ratchet up of the polici path was due in part to econom data that most ran on the strong side of expect and to the absenc of a signal from ani of you that the tighten cycl was draw to a close   the desk   s survey of primari dealer  highlight of which are note in the top right panel  is also consist with the certainti of action today and suggest the anticip of littl chang to the statement and the retent of the assess that the risk to the outlook are tilt to the upsid   as plot in the middl left panel  option contract on fed fund futur settl after the june fomc meet put the largest probabl weight on one more   point firm after today and about equal but less weight on the process of tighten end after today or continu after may   the dot staircas in the middl right panel show how far you   ve come along the path begun at the june      fomc meet     point step at fourteen success meet   the solid line plot the expect feder fund rate deriv from money market futur price prevail just befor the june      meet   as can be seen  your polici firm through last winter about match the track anticip at the onset of the cycl   it has been onli in the past five meet that you pick up the pace relat to market expect of near two year ago   as to whi you might have tighten more than investor origin expect  the answer is not evid in the bottom left panel  which give the evolut of the staff forecast for real gdp growth for             and      over success  book  if anyth  the outlook for real growth has move a touch south over that period  but as shown at the bottom right  the staff outlook for inflat back in june      was decid more favor than what has materi sinc  reflect  among other factor  the more favor prospect at the  e for the price of oil and other import item   if investor also underes  the extent to which inflat would rise  then it wouldn   t be surpris that they would also have underes  the extent of your polici tighten thus far   concern about the prospect for inflat lie at the heart of the case for ad anoth   point step to this tighten episod  the subject of exhibit     polici tighten to date has brought the real feder fund rate  the solid line in the top panel  past the middl of the rang of staff es  of it equilibrium   bring the nomin feder fund rate to    percent would put the real fund rate at the top end of that red rang  although still well in the middl of the confid band around    the materi use by mr  reinhart are append to this transcript  appendix     author for public releas    of     those es    such a stanc  though  would be call for if you view inflat as uncomfort high in your prefer rang or pois to rise from it current level   how deepli those possibl are felt mark the differ between altern b and c in the bluebook   that is  between signal a modest or a strong inclin to tighten at the may meet   market particip  to be sure  are confid of a tighten today and put high odd that you will follow with anoth such action in may  in line with the assumpt in the  book   altern b was design to valid those expect and would be prefer if you view the staff forecast in the bottom left panel of an unemploy rate under   percent and inflat near   percent to be both plausibl and accept   the committe might want to project a firmer stanc of polici   that is  a sure tighten in may and a chanc of further action as in altern c   for sever reason   chief among them might be some mistrust of the main mechan produc slow in consum spend in the staff forecast   name  the deceler in hous price plot at the bottom right  although anecdot of slow in the hous market abound  you might not be readi to sign on to that outlook until more convinc evid is in hand   i now turn to the question pose at the top of exhibit     when are you go to stop   accord to survey and  as shown in the top left panel  futur market predict that you   ll most like ceas tighten by june   the polici rule plot at the top right would predict a quicker end than that   inde  they see some odd that you would alreadi be done   anoth perspect is given in the middl panel  which plot as the red line the long run expect short rate consist with the staff   s arbitrag free model of the term structur   the current short rate  the dark solid line  has alreadi march up to that long run level   you might view argument for further tighten to be problemat for a number of reason   the solid line in the bottom left panel plot the  book forecast for real gdp growth   it not onli slope downward  but it histor confid region also encompass a signific possibl of subpar growth  as in the lower shade region   true  there is an upper shade region  too  but if your own outlook lie below the  book path or you weigh the lower outcom more heavili than the higher one  then you would want a lower  not higher  feder fund rate   the standard argument for further polici action is that it absenc would risk inflam inflat expect   as shown in the bottom right panel  howev  inflat compens at a long horizon has remain veri subdu   the committe   s choic of the fund rate target is onli part of it decis   some word issu are consid in exhibit     in altern b and c in the bluebook  we kept the risk assess tilt toward tighten  as in the top panel   but as shown direct below  the confid bound surround es  polici rule  the   region at the left  or infer from money market option  the blue region at the right  are quit wide   this suggest that the  e will soon arriv when you will no longer be confid in predict the like futur direct of your next action   if ani author for public releas    of     of you think that  e is now  we did offer word for a balanc risk assess in altern a   anoth sentenc offer in altern a is in the third row of the exhibit   the statement could end     nevertheless  futur polici action will be determin by the evolut of the econom outlook as impli by incom inform      i admit that those word don   t mean anyth differ from what appear at the end of the januari statement   and were repeat in altern b and c   i had the hope  though  that chang the languag might draw attent to the sen ent   despit the presenc of that data depend claus in previous statement and it reinforc in success minut  market particip seem more focus on the messag they are receiv from you than from the econom data   for instanc  as note in the bottom row  the respons of the two year note  measur along the vertic axe  to surpris in nonfarm payrol  measur along the horizont axe  had been elev from      to       that   s the middl scatterplot    howev  over the past    year  as can be seen at the far right  the respons has been more subdu  perhap necessit a remind to market to look to the data   i   d like to point out anoth design aspect of altern a  which is provid in the latest version of tabl   at the end of your handout   as is evid  we squeez a lot of word into that column   we did it for two reason   first  it seem appropri for the committe to offer an extend rational for end a tighten phase that has last near two year   second  as you becom less sure of your futur polici action   rememb  this altern has a balanc risk assess   you might want a fuller descript of the econom outlook   by the way  a longer statement might give you the opportun to reli less on imprecis adject and more on a recit of key fact   we tri that out last week with our first draft of tabl    but the few of you who comment were deepli enough oppos that we struck the numer refer   i   d also like to point out chang made in the tabl overnight in light of your discuss ye day  which are provid in blue and seem most consist with what was said earlier this morn   meet particip emphas that growth rebound strong and appear like to settl to a pace consist with that of the economi   s potenti to produc   as a result  the risk to the growth outlook appear rough balanc   in altern b  we ad some forward look languag to that effect in row     becaus mani of you seem a bit more op ist about the prospect for inflat  we repeat the qualifi    possibl    from the januari statement in front of    increas in resourc util    in row   for altern a and b   the other minor chang were made for stylist reason
thank you   are there question for
i have a small question   vinc  in your scatter diagram  you seem to be infer   at least the way i heard you say it   that  base on the last coupl of year  peopl are author for public releas    of     look more to what we say than what we do   what we say has been a lot of the action over the last coupl of year   do we realli have enough data to make that assess   that  in fact  market won   t  go forward  be more sensit to the data than to what we say
you are right   there are not a lot of dot in that bottom right scatter plot
and we pretti much have told them for three year to listen to what we say
we did includ a box in the bluebook that show a more systemat look at the respons to data and that was not look just at the payrol employ surpris   it was look at eleven differ surpris   and it was the case that the respons  no matter   governor kohn is grimac  but that   s okay   laughter
one of his favorit chart  i think
i can tell
my favorit facial express
it   s toward the back if you want to refer to it   but the point is  the respons has move down   what is actual interest is that  if you split these data observ into real side and inflat  the respons to inflat data has come down the most  consist with the view that they think that the feder reserv has actual contain inflat and also consist with subdu inflat expect
that is a long answer to what i realli should say   yes  you are right  we don   t have enough observ to realli know
two hand intervent   presid    author for public releas    of
i just want to ask vinc a question on the word    possibl    in the third row here   could you elabor on whi you put that word in   it just say  the way it said befor  that increas in resourc util have the potenti to add to inflationari pressur   i mean  there have been increas in resourc util
so some concern was express that have drop the word    possibl    relat to what was in januari  the committe would be make the determin that  inde  econom slack had gone away and that the channel itself would put upward pressur on inflat
but capac util is higher   the unemploy rate is lower
right  but i think the issu there is that it is true that resourc util has tighten  but then to make the determin that it could add to inflat pressur is to say that it  in fact  has gone past the level of full capac   that is  the unemploy rate is below the natur rate and output is abov capac   it did not seem  at least from the discuss ye day  that everyon would buy onto the view that the economi was work abov it potenti
thank you  mr  chairman   i take it that you would like us to give the polici recommend that we would favor at this point
no  let me clarifi   i   m sorri   we   re still in the question mode
oh  okay   i thought we were start the round
no   do you have a question
governor olson  do you have a question  author for public releas    of
we have some breakdown here in our system    laughter  are there further question for     presid
i am curious about the question   ask in a memo last week about singl out slower product growth or   what was it    product gain    sn   t that phrase sort of convey some implicit theoriz
heaven forfend    laughter
well  that seem be the point of the question   i was just wonder what you thought about it
i would note that  in your discuss of the economi ye day  a number of you did point out that a well maintain trend in product is hold unit labor cost in check   i am not do well in facial express  but yes   so i will take your object as say that this is  in fact  an inner work in the inflat process that is ul  a monetari phenomenon  and it is not appropri to singl out one of the part of a mechan at this particular  e
so it is consist with the world in which the polici function we are expect to follow has nomin compens growth not respond to product growth chang   product growth chang  and it chang unit labor cost   it  sn   t chang compens growth   so it has inflat respond to chang in product cost
i guess i would have to admit that the word are not that clear   what we meant rather was that  for the given increas in compens  structur product growth has kept unit labor cost from expand more than they would otherwis
then it is a statement like these arithmet contribut to gdp  author for public releas    of
well  okay   it is a differ statement
in the go round i am interest  of cours  in your view on the polici action  and i am also interest in your view on the statement   so that would also be an appropri place if you want to rais issu about the word   that would be fine   other question for     vice chairman
dave   gave us a gentl admonish ye day to clarifi our inflat prefer   at least that is the way i interpret it   you can interpret it that way or that he respond to a question by suggest that  in the absenc of that clariti   laughter  the staff should not be vulner to the critic appli   but i wonder whether vinc or   want to say a bit more about whether it actual matter in think about the op  termin point for the fed fund rate in this tighten cycl whether we have a     percent object for core pce inflat over  e or whether that object is at     if you look at the bluebook  chart     i am not sure what page that is on
page      you can get one set of answer to that   you have not given us this  e the perfect foresight  op  polici rule type of prism to look at the same question   but could you give us just a littl sens of whether it matter now
well  as part of the discuss from ye day  these polici rule are pretti inerti  and in the seven quarter of data to the right of the forecast line  you   re not realli go to see a materi differ from your choic of inflat object   as you can see in the tabl  it realli mean onli    basi point for the polici rule whether you have a   percent goal or a     percent goal   ul  it matter a lot  and you see that in the extend  book forecast  author for public releas    of     you see it in the op  control exercis we show previous  particular in version of the model that involv perfect foresight   you bring forward some of that action  and so that    percentag point differ in your inflat goal   actual control the amount of overshoot of the fund rate that you   re go to find appropri
obvious  in addit to the import of the target or the object itself is your degre of patienc or impati about get there   when we construct the extend  book  in some sens we don   t get to the object veri quick just becaus there may be inertia in polici   that   s up to you to make a decis about   then there are the question about how long it take for econom activ to respond to the polici that you put in place and what transmiss there is into inflat of that chang in polici   and those thing  at least in our larg scale model  take a long  e to steer an inflat rate from one direct to anoth   now  obvious  to the extent that inflat expect can jump or move quick  that model may overst the degre of inertia in the inflat process  and you might be abl to achiev more quick an inflat object with a more pronounc chang in polici   but that   s not the sort of structur of the model that we are work with here
other question   presid pianalto
in your comment about the desk survey and what market are anticip  you said that they anticip littl chang in the statement   but there have been some concern   and  in fact  even a short articl in the wall street journal today mention   that if there is no chang in the statement that was made in januari  investor will probabl ratchet up their rate expect   and there is a risk that  with no signal  after the meet they will build two more move into the futur   have you given ani thought to how to prevent that from happen  author for public releas    of
the word in altern b were design to tri to keep the prevail path for polici expect  and that   s one of the reason they are differ from what is in the leftmost column from the januari fomc statement   i think i agre with your assess that  if you mere repeat the januari statement  then market particip would have two observ in which the word    some further polici firm may be need    impli certain action at the next meet
but then it has also built in an expect of anoth action at the next meet
and so  when they expect littl chang  it is hard to know whether it is no chang in paragraph   versus littl chang in the rational statement
we retain the word of row   but not the assess of the economi  and that is one reason we give so mani reason that inflat prospect may be favor   the idea that market particip would read this to mean that you are inclin toward tighten but see reason whi you may not have to do much
i want to echo vinc on the question rais by presid pianalto   if you look at current expect now and as the desk survey tell us someth about the assumpt behind those expect  though it   s not a perfect proxi for them   there   s a high probabl of a move today  a signific probabl that the committe will decid to move in may  and littl expect of a materi chang in the statement and the signal   that combin of assumpt has not led to a signific probabl of addit move beyond may   that may not be terrif reassur against the risk you   ve rais   the constel of assumpt in the author for public releas    of     desk survey preview one way of judg what that risk is   but if you repeat a formul that   s similar to januari   s  are you go to take too much risk that peopl add to the probabl of a third move or a second move beyond today   i think that risk seem low  but this is essenti unknow
question  presid
mr  chairman  i just want to ask vinc a somewhat radic question  assum that the committe vote to tighten anoth    basi point and the languag rough is what you have in column b  i   m curious as to what you think or mayb dino and the other think the market reaction would be if we elimin row   in it entireti
my suspicion is that they would think you   re done   no guidanc on interest rate mean that you   re not like to act
so you are say that we should tip our hand that we want to maintain or we should indic further polici firm   sort of like presid pianalto   s question
i think it is almost imposs to be absolut neutral   the choic that you have to make is almost binari
that is what i mean
you can take out row    and then the market say     okay   they are done      or if you repeat the present languag  then it sort of confirm  with a certainti or near certainti  that there will be anoth move in may and some possibl of anoth move after that   i think it is veri hard to be pure neutral
essenti the committe is repeat it frustrat back in       when it immedi publish the direct with it announc and it seem that the tilt in the author for public releas    of     direct to the effect that the committe was more like to rais rate than lower them was read as more predict of your futur action than mani of you want   that is  market move to one of the corner and did not view it as a probabl statement   i think you   re in that posit again   i think that one reason we ad to the rational sentenc was to contain that risk
other question for vinc   okay   so let   s begin our polici go round   i   m interest to hear your view on polici action  the statement  and anyth els you think bear on our decis   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i think we   re get to the difficult but interest part of this tighten cycl   it   s alway veri difficult to be preemptiv and forward look   and with rate have risen to where they are  it   s get harder   react to the most recent data   risk overshoot  and i think those taylor rule simul  the equilibrium fund rate calcul  and altern b suggest we alreadi have  or are soon to have  a small degre of restraint in the system  despit all this  i support rais the fund rate    basi point this meet  and indic  as in altern b  that we may have to go further   i have a number of reason for lean on the side of such tighten   resourc util is high   we don   t know the nairu  it could be lower  due to chang in labor market structur or foreign competit   but i think we   re in a zone where we need to be veri  veri cautious about signific further increas in resourc util   and i think we need to be presumpt in our polici that we   re damp that down   unless we see evid that it   s okay  unless we see evid that price are soften  and unless we see evid that unit labor cost are particular well behav and there isn   t some inflat risk  i think our presumpt must be that we need to get this economi slow to a more sustain pace  author for public releas    of     and i agre with your assess  mr  chairman  of the strength of demand   i think without further polici increas we do risk rise resourc util   there is still consider strength in final demand   some of this could be weather relat   some of it could be a catch up from the fourth quarter   undoubt it is  but we don   t know how much   and i think the under sens is that demand is strong   what littl high frequenc data we have  such as the initi claim for unemploy insur  suggest that the labor market continu to move right along into earli march   i think that stop now or indic that the next move would be the last would caus a ralli in financi market  and we   d be concern that financi condit would no longer be consist with better assur that the economi is go to glide in here at high level of resourc util rather than further increas in resourc util  in lean toward restraint  i also give a littl weight to the overal price increas  we   ve seen sever year of rapid price increas in the overal cpi   there is the issu that presid   rais ye day of these propag through to core inflat through expect   but it is also not entir clear to me that the core index is the be all and end all for public welfar when the real price of energi has risen   and ignor total inflat entir i   m not sure is the right thing to do  if energi price aren   t go to return to a real mean   so i give a littl weight to total inflat be higher  now  i haven   t bought into the comfort zone mantra  at least not yet    laughter   and i must say i   m a littl bother by the notion that we   re in the high end of the   to   percent comfort zone when at least three tenth of that is these nonmarket price increas that grow out of es  by the bea   i   m told that our staff can   t even replic their es  procedur   so quit how much public welfar i want to rest on nonreplic price calcul  author for public releas    of     i   m not sure   i think the market base pce is at       we need to think veri care about what index we might use if we do go to a comfort zone or a target kind of rang  but at this stage of the cycl  given the strength in demand and high level resourc util  i   m convinc we should lean hard against ani potenti increas in inflat   and i   m mind that  becaus inflat expect are anchor  the phillip curv is flat and it will take a while to see inflationari consequ onc they start   i think that  befor we stop tighten  we   d want to see a littl more evid that condit were in place to cool demand  on the word of the direct itself  i think that we are move into a stage at which we   ll need a few more word to explain whi we   re do what we   re do   for the last coupl of year  the focus has been entir on the balanc of risk assess and the fact that we   ve announc our rate increas and what we   re go to do  and peopl haven   t paid much attent to the rational paragraph   through this period  polici has been data depend to some extent   but  as we have all said in our speech  we are becom more data depend  and as we becom more data depend  it behoov us to explain to the public what data we   re look at   as we go forward from here  we   ll have to think care about how to phrase the rational paragraph to help the public understand what the most import data are   i expect that import to chang from  e to  e  with respect to the specif word under the revis altern b  i was glad to see the phrase    appear like to moder to a more sustain pace      i think that captur what near everybodi around the tabl was say ye day   in term of product gain hold down unit labor cost  i see the inflat process work import through the labor market and through labor cost   i agre that compens should catch up to product at some point  but i think we can take a bit of comfort from the relat modest gain in unit labor cost  even author for public releas    of     make the correct the chairman did   one possibl addit to make it more complet would be to say that    ongo product gain and moder increas in compens have held the growth of labor cost in check      and i agre with the use of    possibl increas in resourc util    becaus i   m not readi to say that     or     is below the nairu   i think that remain to be seen  and i agre with presid pianalto   s concern that the    may    could caus the market to build in a littl more tighten   still  these are the word that seem to me to describ veri accur what i think we should be about   a littl more tighten after today may be need  we   re not sure  and the market will just have to do what the market do   we do have the minut come out in a coupl week  which would clarifi that   sorri to go on so long
thank you   presid pool
thank you  mr  chairman   i certain favor an increas of    basi point in the fund rate   and i also think that  given what we think we know from our current inform about the state of the economi  it   s high probabl that when we come up to our next meet we will want anoth    basi point   that   s my view on the basi of the inform now avail  i thought the staff discuss of the two year rate   s react relat littl to recent data was quit interest   i would make the follow observ   i think that we have had  actual  veri few signific data surpris   and so one reason you don   t get veri much is that there hasn   t been a data surpris to which the two year rate has react   i would note that there was a pretti substanti reaction to hurrican katrina becaus  befor the hurrican  the market had bake into it an increas of    basi point and then that drop to a probabl of    percent  if i recal   so there was a reaction to the hurrican  and then  as a consequ of author for public releas    of     statement from chairman  span  particular  and other  that came back out of the market  so that   s not part of the macroeconom data set that you use in test this proposit   i think it make good sens for the market in recent year  and even the last six month  not to be veri reactiv to current data  given the forward guidanc that   s in the statement and given what we   ve been say  despit the claus in paragraph   of the statement  it seem to me that  given the background of where we are  given that we would like the economi to continu to move on a good path of growth and for inflat to remain restrain  that we should not alter the statement unless we have a veri clear purpos in mind right now  the  e will come when we will alter the statement   but the market is go to be read between the line of anyth that we publish   and so  unless we have a clear purpos in mind by chang some of this languag  i would not chang it to produc someth that we regard as synonym becaus the market is go to look at that and say     well  they are tri to send us some messag   if they didn   t want to send a differ messag  whi would they be chang the thrust of the languag      so that   s whi my view is that we are go to need further rate increas  i would also note that if we were oper with a money growth target in a world with minim money demand disturb and all of that  we would anticip that a strong economi would be drive up interest rate   so if you think that what we   re do with the feder fund target is tri to replic what you would get under a money growth system that could work under ideal circumst  we would expect rate to be go up with a strong economi   and that   s what i think we have to tri to replic   so  until we are readi to tell the market that we think that we   re done  we should do practic noth in term of the statement becaus the market will read someth into it that we might not intend  author for public releas    of     i also think that  given the histori  should we get a larg surpris in the employ data or anyth els   let   s say a larg downward surpris   the market would probabl focus pretti quick on that paragraph   about the committe   s respond to econom prospect   as long as we don   t get ani signific surpris  the market is not go to react   and  inde  we should not want the market to react becaus  if we continu to get data come in at or on the high side of expect  we should be quit pleas that the market is bid up interest rate becaus that   s exact where we   re probabl go to want to go under those circumst  thank you
thank you   governor olson
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support the   point increas  and i   m persuad today by the theme i hear repeat that we want to maintain confid in the feder reserv   i was particular taken with presid  n   s statement that his read on the peopl he   s talk to is that the fed would not allow inflat to get loos  i wonder about what it would take to contain long term inflationari expect  clear it is not simpli a u s  phenomenon becaus the yield curv and inflationari expect around the world are veri similar   it seem to me that  in look at the taylor construct  we may be at the upper end  with one more move  of where we want to be in term of a polici respons   it   s possibl to read in one of the chart that the market is anticip to some extent that we may actual overshoot and come back   but recogn the import of our be dilig with respect to inflat  i think that it   s go to be a much tougher decis next  e as to whether or not we should rais   dino   s comment about our have a sort of binari decis right now is exact right   we ought to maintain the statement that we have   my prefer author for public releas    of     would be to have taken out the sentenc regard further move  but i think it   s the right sentenc to leav in at this  e
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  this issu of tighten is kind of like pascal   s wager about the exist of god  and our person gain   loss ratio as central banker indic an answer in the affirm   that is  i do think vice chairman   made a veri good point about expect and about the expect of how we will perform our duti  despit the question i ask earlier about row    i am in favor of further tighten   i am in favor becaus i believ that the tighten that we   ve done  although we don   t yet have answer to the question we   ve ask about lag   sn   t seem to have done much harm in term of slow the pace of econom expans   i would like to build a reserv that we can then subtract from if we need to respond to weak   and so i am in favor of tighten  and i am in favor of continu tighten becaus     it seem not to be do great damag to econom growth  which is stout      i   d like to have someth to give back when we see weak  and     i   d like to ward off inflat  i have onli one request on the word  and that is that we insert the word    global    befor    resourc util       laughter   thank you   i never give up
had to put that in there    laughter   presid hoenig
thank you  mr  chairman   i have a slight differ view   i would go with a   i wouldn   t dissent over it if i were a vote member  but i would push veri hard for signal that we are just about at the end   and here is a bit of my reason   i think we are at or in the area of equilibrium in term of the fed fund rate   perhap we   re even at the upper end  i know we can   t observ what the equilibrium rate is  but then we can   t observ the nairu author for public releas    of     either  and we tend to put a lot of weight on that   if we believ our project   the  book or our own project   i suggest we are move back toward trend  even without further action   then i think we are where we need to be   if we believ the  book that we need to rais the rate and then come back down  then we are about where we need to be  so i think that   s import to keep in mind   also  probabl most in this room have said at one  e or anoth that monetari polici act with a lag  but we never believ it   and here we are  we   ve tighten for how long   we recent tighten again   we are at a point at which we say there aren   t realli inflationari pressur  and yet we have tighten up   the outlook is that we would move to trend  and yet we haven   t had the full effect of our recent tighten   the fourth quarter was weak but for transitori reason  and the first quarter bump up was a bounceback for the weak fourth quarter  and we   re head toward trend   i think we are where we need to be  and we need to be patient about that   and about whether we move again   we ought to have our languag say that we are not move but that we may if the data come in stronger than we anticip and than our own project suggest they would  so here we are anxious again about it   the economi is strong   we   ve heard it   s strong  and yet we don   t believ that it will taper off  so we   ve got to do someth about it   and that is our histori   alway go too far   i think that   s what we   re in danger of   whether we go to    percent today is not the issu   the issu is that we are about where we should be  and if we   re go to signal someth  that   s what we should be signal to the market
thank you   presid
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m reason comfort with the stabil of inflat and inflat expect right now   but  frank  they   re a littl on the high side for my tast  and i say this with due appreci of the calcul problem that author for public releas    of     governor kohn allud to   the expect cpi and the term spread are run around     percent   that seem high to me  but i   d be open to persuas if the staff had inform that there was some inher bias  that we shouldn   t take that as the center point es  of the distribut of the true rate of increas there  in think about the polici decis today  i judg that the public   s expect of our move onc after today and then take a break  given the current state of the economi and the near term outlook  is pretti reason   but in think through the decis we are face or are go to face in the next coupl of month about decid where to stop  i find myself cast about for way to gaug what short term real rate are go to need to be on a sustain basi go forward   if you look back at the late      s   anoth period of sustain  fair balanc growth   two more   point move are go to put us at the lower end of the real rate we saw back then   and take that togeth with a sens that the world economi is strengthen now and inflat is a touch on the high side suggest that further move beyond   percent might be necessari   on the other hand  forward short real rate are remark low  and that suggest that price stabil might requir lower real rate than we otherwis would have thought   we might have to come back down below   percent later on  as the market expect   but if i had to bet  i   d bet on the first risk rather than the latter   in ani event  i   d be happier move market expect in the direct of the lower ul  expect inflat rate  even if that meant somewhat higher expect short real rate  i   ll repeat someth i   ve said befor and then comment on someth don said and someth vinc said   i agre with governor kohn that  when we do reach a rest point  we should be care to communic in such a way that the public  sn   t place too much probabl on our stay fix for a long period of  e   vinc said that he is find evid author for public releas    of     that the market are look to us rather than to the data  and perhap it   s the case that uncertainti about our intent is distract market from react to the incom data   i just mention this in the context of row     the logic of the balanc of risk assess is not to express our intent or express what we   re go to do with polici  realli  but to sort of ask the public to revers engin thing from our signal about what we   re go to do with interest rate a coupl of month ahead  it strike me that  when we get around to reconsid the statement later this year  it would be use to step back from that whole logic and think it through on a more fundament basi   i think it would be prefer for the public to understand our intent and for reaction to the data to come in on that basi rather than for them to be hang onto our word about our intent go forward   but that   s someth that i   m sure we   ll work to clear up over  e  so i   m fine with the statement as it is  theoriz and all  and i   m happi with the decis in altern b
thank you   presid  n
thank you  mr  chairman   let me just comment on a few thing   first of all  i support increas the feder fund rate anoth   percentag point today   i think that   s consist with the  book forecast  with which i   m comfort  and it   s clear what market particip expect   and i don   t think this is a  e when we want to surpris market particip  in think about polici strategi go forward  i guess what interest me the most  and concern me the most  is june rather than may   there   s a high likelihood  and clear the market expect  that we will be move again in may   but i think it   s import that we tri to get ourselv some more flexibl and some more wiggl room come june   so i think exact author for public releas    of     what we say and how we say it are go to matter here   have said that  it   s not easi to have a big impact  it seem to me  on what peopl might expect for june without go further than i feel comfort in say that we   re about to stop or we will stop after one more increas   i do think that it might help  at least on the margin  to adopt paragraph   from altern a for the reason that   point out   get peopl to focus more on the data and less on what we may think about it would be help  the onli other thing i would add is   and i realiz i   m in the minor on this   that i   m not altogeth comfort with this constant refer to resourc util   as you know  i   m not a big fan of the nairu concept   i   m not comfort with the empir work there  and i take presid     s point that in an increas global economi we need to be a littl care about think too narrowli about this
thank you   presid pianalto
thank you  mr  chairman   as i said ye day  the  book baselin captur the broad contour of my expect   name  solid growth go forward and project for inflat move downward over the forecast period   but that baselin is broad the same forecast that we receiv in januari  and in januari it was support by a      percent fund rate   obvious  this  book has that same outcom be support by a   percent fund rate  base on the incom report that i receiv from my district contact  my guess is that the januari forecast was about right   so i do fulli support anoth    basi point increas in the fed fund rate today   but then  that leav open  obvious  as other have said  whether it   s go to prove necessari to move to   percent or higher and how we communic that  author for public releas    of     as i mention ye day  my impress is that the  book is show pressur in the labor market  and that was one of the central reason for move the fed fund path upward to get the same inflat outlook   becaus i   m not see those same pressur  i   m inclin to believ that a    basi point move today rough balanc the upsid and downsid forecast risk for inflat   therefor  i could support leav this meet with the presumpt that the rate hike today is more than like the last one for a while  now  have said that  i am sensit to the distinct between a forecast risk and a polici risk   and although i see the risk to the forecast  particular the inflat forecast  as relat balanc at a    percent fund rate  i   m not avers to take out some addit insur in case there is an upsid risk or a surpris on the upsid in inflat  becaus core inflat is current run at a rate higher than i want to see  so that lead me to think not so much about this meet or even the may meet but  as other have said  about the june meet   as we discuss earlier  my concern is that have no chang in the assess of risk languag today is go to reinforc the expect that there will be anoth    basi point increas in may  and i   m a littl concern that it will also lead to an expect of an addit    basi point increas in june   when my staff look at the distribut of market expect base on option on fed fund futur  in the week or so follow our last meet there was a movement up  but not becaus the data came in unexpect high   the data came in where they were expect  but the fed fund option did move up   i   m concern that we   re go to see a similar pattern after this meet if we don   t make some chang to the languag   but given governor kohn   s comment and some of the other  the minut can help us with that   our statement can certain also help us convey that  author for public releas    of     given my concern  though  i have to say that i was interest in the languag that was suggest in the bluebook by     that we modifi our statement in section   just slight to say that some addit firm may be need   howev  given peopl   s comment today  i can live with keep section   languag the same and accept some of the chang that   has laid out in altern b  but i suggest that we then use our minut and our statement if we   re start to see too much movement in market expect about where we   re go to go  thank you
thank you   first vice presid stone
thank you  mr  chairman   i support a   point increas in the feder fund rate   i think  as we said ye day  the risk to growth are balanc   risk to inflat are moder tilt to the upsid  with core inflat near the top of the rang that i feel comfort with   ani posit aggreg demand shock could send inflat higher than we   d like   i think that the committe is probabl close to the end of a tighten cycl  whether it   s    basi point or    basi point away   in look at those risk  i think that there is a greater risk to end hike at a level that turn out to be too low than the risk of end at a level that turn out to be a littl too high  i support the languag in altern b   i am a bit concern about the interpret that may say that the expect are for two more increas   i came in today support the final languag that came out in altern b after the modif   i now think it   s import to keep the word    possibl    in the languag becaus  if we take that out  peopl may almost certain believ that we   re look at greater concern about inflat than i think we   ve indic in our discuss   so it   s import to keep the word    possibl    in the discuss  and author for public releas    of     i would keep the rest of the languag the same   but certain in the futur the phrase is go to be veri import  particular at the may meet   thank you
thank you veri much  mr  chairman   i much appreci the chang in the format of the meet wherebi you summar the general point of agreement ye day and gave your own sens of the outlook   i thought that was a help chang and someth that was quit use to me   i know that  as i sat down earli this morn to think about my own polici prescript  given everyth we have been look at and talk about and the discuss ye day  i was struck by how good the near term outlook look   clear there are risk to both growth and inflat from a number of differ forc   but to borrow vice chairman     s languag from ye day  there   seem to be a good probabl that the trajectori for the economi is one of an order transit   i like that       order transit    from a higher rate of growth to a somewhat slower rate of growth  less potenti for price pressur  and continu solid perform  so i think that that is a fabul place in which to be   the question i ask myself is how best can polici  both what we do and what we say about it  ensur that outcom or give that outcom the best chanc of happen   i find myself a bit between presid hoenig and presid   on this   and to some extent presid pianalto  too   i think there is someth to recommend about be abl to say that we are either readi to stop now after this    basi point or we soon will be  the question is how to do it   how to say that  to me  is a difficult problem   presid hoenig made a good point about our forecast say that we are go to go up    basi point now  anoth    point at the next meet  and then six month or so later back down anoth      that   author for public releas    of     seem to say to me that  over the period in which monetari polici usual work  mayb we will be in about the right place with this    basi point  i am in favor of a    basi point move becaus i do think there are some slight upsid risk for inflat in stay at      and it is a matter of risk manag   almost like presid pianalto   s concern about insur   as a matter of risk manag  anoth small move upward is a good idea   that is encompass in both altern b and altern c   i much prefer b becaus it   have a more balanc discuss of risk  now  what i could clear see do is take four and five in the assess of risk from altern a and put those in altern b and basic say to peopl     there is a chanc that we are where we need to be   we are go to watch the data  and we are not give you a solid take on what the next meet will be      i know there are peopl who believ that convey that would provok too great a market reaction   mayb that is true  but i still think at some point and some point soon  may perhap and certain june  we are go to have to figur out a way to say that we are stop and we are not give you futur guidanc becaus we don   t know what futur guidanc to give you   we don   t have ani clearer crystal ball than the rest of you do  and frank  we would like to see what your is say rather than simpli get feedback about what you think our is say  so i am in favor of b   i could graft on four and five from a   i take the point that i think some of you would make  some of you have alreadi made  that that might provok too great a reaction from the market and increas the upsid risk to growth and  given where we are in term of resourc util  possibl unhing inflat expect  although i don   t give that a high probabl   but it could produc a bit of market turmoil   mayb we don   t need it  author for public releas    of     i am a littl concern that we are a bit more hostag to the market    understand of us than i am realli comfort with   i would rather do what we need to do and let them figur out how to get use to it rather than constant have to modifi what we do base on what they think we are tell them that we are go to do   and i am look forward to the day when we are a littl bit clearer about all of that   for the  e be  i can go with b the way it is   i kind of like the languag that is the altern languag mention in one of the paragraph in the bluebook  but it is realli hard to get into wordsmith even earli in the morn on the second day of the meet   laughter  so i am okay with b   i am not a vote member  but i wouldn   t dissent over the languag even if i were   but i realli do look forward to be abl to say  either in may or in june     we are done   we are go to be look at the data   you tell us what you think we ought to be do
thank you   presid guynn
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  favor a    basi point increas in our fund rate target today  and with that move and base on discuss that we had ye day and this morn  i judg that we are close to be balanc   howev  even at the point of presum balanc  i remind myself that a negat surpris on inflat would be more worrisom to me than a negat surpris on growth  and that suggest to me that we do want  as best we can judg  to have a slight restrict polici stanc   i believ we are close to be at that point  i also share the concern express by sandi pianalto in her question and cathi and gari in their comment that i wish we could find some word that would be a littl less precis in term of this futur guidanc becaus i do think  like other  that we are at a point where it is not terribl help to us or to the market to have them like build in two more move after this one   i   m not as sure as other that that is where we want to be   i like cathi   s character of be hostag to author for public releas    of     market expect  which we in turn creat with our statement if we are not care   so i do not have a word to suggest  but i wish we could find a way in line   to convey someth other than two more move after this one  i am also less attract than other to ad a lot more word to the statement for a coupl of reason   first of all  as i listen to the discuss ye day  i thought that we have some differ view around the tabl in term of what we are watch and what we think  and i do not know whether it is possibl to construct a whole bunch of word that captur the committe sens  and if it is a committe statement  i think it is import that it reflect the committe   i also would observ that if we are go to have a fundament discuss of the construct of the statement  it might not be help to get ourselv to a point where we have ad lot and lot and lot of word now and have to back away from that   it would be much easier  it seem to me  to stay as simpl and as close to where we have been as possibl  with the option of expand the statement later rather than tri to go back the other way  i also want to lobbi for the littl  seem harmless cell in line   under altern a   i would like to see those new word substitut for what we use at the last coupl of meet in whatev altern we come up with   i think that not onli would they caus peopl to focus more sharpli on the fact that they need to think with us about the data we   re see  but that they actual construct a differ sens   the word would  i hope  caus peopl not to whiplash with everi singl piec of data that come out but would emphas that it affect the    econom outlook      i think that   s a better way to say that than what we have been say in the past   so i would make that chang in ani event   i think that is as much as i want to say   thank you  mr  chairman
thank you   presid    author for public releas    of
thank you  mr  chairman   i think overal we are in a good posit at this point with the economi essenti at full employ and growth home in on potenti  which will  i hope  hold unemploy rough steadi   core inflat is pretti steadi although  at least by sever measur and particular the core pce  it is in the top half of the rang that i would like to see   but i agre with governor kohn that this is a matter that we should consid   what index  and where it is relat to what we would like  bear further think about  if you take inflat to be in the top half of a comfort rang as oppos to the middl  an op  polici set would place the fund rate toward the upper end of a neutral rang or would be minim restrict   i say    minim    becaus we are at most a littl abov the middl of the so call comfort rang and also becaus the various rule present in chart   of the bluebook suggest that the appropri respons of polici to a deviat of inflat from the middl of the rang is actual quit small  if inflat were to declin  say     basi point  from   percent to     percent  the respons  accord to most of the rule in the tabl  of the fed fund rate to that deviat is on the order of    or    basi point   so it is sort of a one polici move differ   at this point  it seem to me  polici is pretti close to appropri posit  in term of risk assess  i share governor kohn   s concern about the possibl that growth won   t actual slow to a sustain pace and so the economi may overheat   but i am also concern about overshoot  in part becaus the delay effect of our polici action may show up especi in the hous sector with greater forc than we expect and we are a littl uncertain     mention this ye day   about just what the spillov might be to consum spend via balanc sheet effect or wealth effect   i think we do need to be sensit to the possibl of overshoot  and here i would endors presid hoenig   s comment on that   so i can certain author for public releas    of     support a    basi point tighten today coupl with some slight polici inclin for further firm   but i would not like to do anyth to boost the market   s percept of the like end point of the cycl   i   m not sure what the best way is to accomplish that   i had first found myself have some prefer for use the altern languag suggest for b that would say that some modest addit polici firm may be need   but i am not sure that is the right way to go  as i look forward  i share the concern that a number of you have express   that as we get to the may meet we are go to find not onli that market expect us to go anoth    but also that an addit    will be price into the market   and it seem to me that the construct of our statement rais the likelihood that market are go to continu to build in expect for move beyond   percent   let me explain in part what i   m worri about   i am worri about the way in which line   of altern b character our concern about energi and commod price   as i look at the new bluebook handout that vinc just gave us  i like the chang that has been made in line   where it say that the econom growth has rebound but in effect then add     but look  in our committe forecast  we want to let you know we   re expect realli strong number for q   but we think it is then go to moder to a more sustain pace     now  we might have tri to do the same thing in line    but unfortun we didn   t   we don   t state what our forecast is to give market a reason way to judg incom data   let me get a bit more specif about what i mean   consid the  book forecast for core pce inflat for the remaind of this year   i   m more op ist than the  book is  but the  book forecast is that  for the remaind of this year  core pce inflat is go to come in at     percent  which is certain abov the top end of the comfort rang that i or anyon els who has opin on this has suggest  author for public releas    of     so what will the market respons be if the  book forecast actual materi   it seem to me that the  book project that the uptick would be temporari  so we needn   t respond   but the statement in b essenti say     look   the run up in energi price has had onli a modest effect on core inflat      in effect  it say we continu to think that that will be the way the world transpir  and in the end i think it say that we regard it as an upsid risk to our forecast that elev price of energi and other commod have the potenti to add to inflat pressur   so if  in point of fact  the  book is right and we start see     for core pce  what will market conclud      yes  this is what they   re worri about   they   re realli worri that an upsid risk to their inflat forecast is that inflat is go to come in this high   what are we to conclud other than that this is a negat surpris to the committe  and therefor they are go to go abov   percent      so we have told market particip in line       don   t be surpris if you see a veri strong growth number in q    we think that   s temporari   it   s go to abat      what we haven   t told market is the compar thing  name  that we may well see a boost in core pce inflat for the next coupl of quarter  but we think it is temporari  one thing that we could do would be to chang the phrase and say in line   that the elev price of energi and other commod may boost core inflat modest for a  e   that would distinguish this from the case of rise inflat due to resourc util  which we do see as an upsid risk to our forecast   but general whether or not we make this chang  i am concern that we are go to see more increas price into fed fund futur  and i would cheer endors the kind of move that has been made in this draft of altern b  in which the committe   s forecast for growth has been clear enunci   and move in that direct for our baselin forecast for inflat would be a use way to go as well  author for public releas    of     if i could just spend one more second  i would like to propos a bit more wordsmith in altern b   a principl  or a practic  that i learn at the council of econom advis that i think would be a good one for us is that you never make a statement that purport to be a statement of fact unless it can be fact check    laughter   this process is rigor there   i would say the first statement in line        as yet the run up in the price of energi and other commod has had onli a modest effect on core inflat      is not fact checkabl   i believ that   s the case   i think most of you believ that   s the case   i wouldn   t want to have to fact check it   i don   t know how you would do it   i would add someth like    has appar had onli a modest effect on core inflat      the point about the fact that product gain have held the growth of unit labor cost in check  i don   t person mind that at all   i agre with that   i simpli think that it is not the onli thing   arithmet modest compens gain have done the same thing   so i do not mind list it  but i would say    have help
thank you   it is    o   clock   whi don   t we take fifteen minut for a coffe break   coffe break
presid    are you readi
yes   thank you  mr  chairman   i favor the    basi point increas and the languag in altern b   i do not think this is the  e to keep our rate at the current level  and i don   t think it   s the  e for us to give a signal that we are about to stop   the likelihood is that we will probabl have to go to   percent  but we do not know   as we said all along  it is go to depend on the data  the second point i would make is that this will make fourteen consecut    basi point increas in the fed fund rate   so we have known for a long  e  as we have gone down this path  author for public releas    of     that when we want to stop or we thought we would want to stop we would have to give a signal to the market   and i do not think this is the  e to do it now   mayb in may it will be   again  it will all depend on the data whether we will want to stop in may  but that is the  e that we would give a clear signal to the market  now  if the market get ahead of us  as some have been concern about here  in the past the chairman of this committe has given a signal of some sort between meet  and we have alway had that option   the chairman alway has that option   some peopl have rais the question about whether we are hostag to the market   i person don   t feel we are hostag to the market at all   at some point the market will have to live with our decis  and if we are go to do someth that is differ from what the market expect  so be it   but i certain do not think that this committe is be held hostag to the market  on the statement  i thought bill pool   s philosophi of minimum chang until we are readi to give a differ signal is a veri good philosophi  and in that regard i would say two thing   first  some peopl have suggest possibl tweak number five  and i just do not see the real benefit of do that   that this may help chang some expect is a veri subtl psycholog point  and i certain would not want to go to the bank on that   we are much better off stay the way we are  now  have said that  i bring up the word    possibl     which come around and bite me in the tail a bit becaus we did have    possibl    in the januari fomc statement   so i   ll fold my tent on that   laughter   i think we are free to use the word    possibl    there in the interest of consist  second  on the statement itself   in the earlier version that was circul to the committe  some specif data were refer to  and someon made the comment here that it is import for us to explain to the public what data we are think about   i forget who said that   but i realli agre with     s comment  and then tom sent a note in too  say that we want to keep the statement as author for public releas    of     short as possibl and then use the minut for that purpos   the minut  again  come out three week after the meet   we have acceler them   we also use speech  but certain the minut are a perfect vehicl for elabor on the statement itself   and i think that philosophi is a veri good one  then i just want to say a few word about inflat and fed credibl   we are all veri pleas with the low inflat number that we have seen so far  and a number of peopl have mention the import of fed credibl and keep inflat low   as we know  the  book forecast has core inflat go up abov   percent  and i think we don   t know exact how long it would stay at that   we do not know if it is go to go abov   percent  and we don   t know how long it is go to stay abov that level   but i am uncertain myself as to how long it could stay abov   percent without have an impact on inflationari expect   this is just someth we have to take into account and say we want to be vigil about   there is a lot of uncertainti here   we just have to keep monitor it  in term of the real economi  the best forecast is that growth will be near potenti or higher this year   so i think we definit want to maintain as much flexibl as possibl in our statement now to allow for the possibl that we may want to move even higher than the  book assumpt in the futur   again  it is go to depend on the data  as we have all said  and we just do not know at this point  and i think the languag in altern b give us this leeway
thank you   governor bie
we have a two hander

absolut  author for public releas    of
i have a propos to offer here that make use of the minut  as michael suggest   we make our statement after this meet with minim chang and then use the minut to say four thing   one  the committe believ that  after may  accommod will have been larg remov   two  polici will be respons to the data   in the light of that  three  if the economi remain strong and inflat risk remain a concern  some further rate increas may be necessari depend on the data   four  data indic that inflat risk are reced would lead most like to the polici rate remain unchang  if we said that  we could then at the next meet essenti do away with sentenc   and   in the polici statement   we would have found a way to exit from the forward guidanc that has been in the statement   and then along the way  if the data come in suggest that further polici tighten is appropri  we use the minut to indic whi the rate chang  but we have most gotten out of the forward guidanc   so here is a specif propos to tri to explain this in the minut with as much clariti as we possibl can
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i   m in support of a    basi point increas today   i am favor altern b  but i want to make some comment about the word  one of the thing i am struggl with  in addit to some of the point everybodi has made around the tabl  is the appar presenc of a tremend amount of liquid in the market  i look at how much we have rais rate  but the fact that there is so much out there that the bank are tri to lend and that other market are tri to invest tell me that there is a lot of liquid   i think that the liquid pressur are an inflationari risk  and that is someth that will influenc my decis about whether or not we need to stop   becaus of the amount of liquid out there  i am not comfort say we are there yet  author for public releas    of     the second thing i would like to point out is that i like presid guynn   s new beard   laughter  but i also support his recommend to look more close at altern a  line     one of the reason i like a   or someth along that line is the use of word like    evolut    and    impli by incom inform      compar with what we now have in line    these word give a differ tone   that we are look at a slow move set of data come in  not one piec of data and not one seri of data   as in everi meet  i heard around the tabl today that  given the month volatil in all the seri we look at  all of us are take all of these togeth   we are smooth through one month blip  and word that are closer to    evolut    than to    chang    give us a better sens that we are look at the whole tone of inform come in   i would like us to move down that path go forward   i can stick with the word today  but i think that that kind of approach may make peopl less depend on one seri of data in one month in the releas
thank you  mr  chairman   i also support the    basi point increas in the feder fund rate target   obvious the question that we are deal with now is not just op  monetari polici but also op  inform disclosur and op  communic polici   there are a lot of move part right now  a lot of chang  and so for the moment  i would probabl favor be leaner rather than fuller in descript even if we decid to go forward in the longer run with fuller descript  which i think is perfect reason  as has been describ  there are a lot of altern   not just the statement but also the minut   there are speech  and speech on communic could be given specif   there are also background session with key player in the journal communiti and elsewher   so i think that someth on the order of b or even a slim down b would be most appropri at the moment   i would not lean toward go to someth like a   yet   that may provid us with a author for public releas    of     veri good basi for think about what we might want to do next  e   so i applaud   and other who help to creat altern a  in some sens a way to get us think about where we might be move and some of the cost and benefit of do that   but particular given that i have heard somewhat differ view from committe member about where they  given current data and current  book project  would be like to go  i do not think we want to signal someth too clear at the moment  also  we have had some discuss about whether or not we can take back    basi point  i don   t realli see the economi as be on such a knife edg that we will know that it   s exact   or exact    or exact      i think it is high unlik that we go to    and get inform that we know that we have gone exact    basi point too much and have to have a retrench   it is more like that the economi would evolv and then we would think that thing had realli move in a differ direct  and if we were to have to move down the line  it would be more than a    basi point move   histor that has been typic  although not alway the case  and has been true both in the unit state and elsewher   so we should not overemphas that we will get it exact right and that we will know exact where we will be   we have to be in a comfort zone not onli on inflat but also in term of where our target rate is   it is use to think in those kind of term about where we will be go and also to realiz that retrench are unlik to be the sort that a few month later we take back a littl even if that   s what the market may be predict   but i leav that to other who may have much more experi in that  mayb my view is a littl nave
thank you  mr  chairman   i  too  support the    basi point increas in the feder fund rate and would just like to make a coupl of point about the market and market expect  author for public releas    of     it   strike me as a particular inopportun  e to miss market expect   given the chang in the economi that we have discuss over the last day and a half  particular a slowdown in hous  potenti some growth in the busi side  increas expect of growth oversea  and  to be candid  the chang here at the feder reserv  it strike me that we should be take increment step both in term of messag chang and in term of the sort of statement we have  so this would be  i think  a veri success meet if everyon yawn at the statement and the market reaction were somewhat bore this afternoon and tomorrow  an issu was rais about whether we   re lead the market or the market is lead us   it strike me that the market   and i particular have in mind trader down on the floor   are look to us becaus i think they   re also confus  and so they don   t know where els to look   this is sort of a safe place for them to cast their eye and sharpen their pencil   i hope  over the cours of the may and june meet  that they  like us  will be see other data point that will give them a clearer crystal ball and that they will be look both to us and to some other data point to inform their think   but right now  i think their sens of thing is fair cloudi   so with that  we have a particular larg burden of presumpt in figur out whether we make chang to what was done in januari  a final point on market and the ownership of the statement  mr  chairman  which you referenc earlier   the typic trader in these market  sn   t fulli appreci what we   re vote on and the entireti of this statement  and my own view is that   s a littl more than would be ideal to be air in the public forum   for trader to be read one paragraph and say     oh  that   s chairman bernank     and to be read the other paragraph and say     well  that   s the consensus of the committe     strike me as invit into their debat a littl too much interpret beyond the data author for public releas    of     set   so i think our discuss go forward in term of who own what would probabl best be carri out in the same close confid that previous discuss here were  final  in keep with the suggest that i think presid pool made about our make as few chang as possibl to the januari statement at present  the onli wordsmith i would offer in altern b is the first two word of section       as yet      i   m tri to show as much congruenc as possibl with the januari statement  and so when i see key word like    still    in altern b  i think that   s rough equival to    nevertheless      but    as yet    realli is borrow in some way from altern c  which suggest to me almost an inevit   that is  we expect inflat to be come      as yet    we don   t see it  but it is almost inevit   and it strike me that the    as yet    word are potenti market move word and that they will perhap suggest more vigil regard inflat  more concern about inflat expect than we had onli a coupl of month ago   so the minor suggest might be to strike the word    as yet    and continu with altern b as written befor us  and that in either regard i firm support
thank you  mr  chairman   i think we realli do have a remark degre of consensus around the tabl about the forecast  and you did a veri nice job of captur that consensus   the consensus is realli quit close to the  book  closer than it has been perhap in recent meet   the  book forecast is condit on a monetari polici assumpt that has us essenti stop at   with the path pretti flat from   on  the question  of cours  for us today is whether we want to alter current market expect about the path of polici  and i think it is hard to find a compel case to do so  either from what we discuss around the tabl or from what the  book provid   the bluebook provid altern prism to look at the implic of past polici   the presumpt is that we don   t want author for public releas    of     to chang expect substanti becaus we don   t see a case for chang the current stanc of monetari polici as embodi in those expect   the question is how best to do it  and i think b is probabl the closest we   re go to get to that  i agre with the concern that sandi began with and which i think dino echo   that there is some possibl  mayb even a likelihood  that b is interpret as rais the probabl of not just a move in may but a move beyond may   again  i don   t see ani need to do that   i don   t think it should be our object to tri to rais the probabl around june   the question realli is how to avoid that   i do think that ad the sustain growth refer in the second row and ad    possibl     as vinc explain  help against that risk  but it probabl  sn   t take away all of that risk   the problem with do thing that creat the risk of push down the curv is that peopl would react to that by say     well  what   that mean about how confid they are about the strength of under demand growth      one consequ of an altern that would be design to push down that curv would be  in some sens  question rais about how confid we are in our forecast about the under strength of demand growth  which i don   t think that we have a basi for signal at this point  is there some risk we are go to go too far   of cours there is   what are the best tool we have to assess that risk   again  i think the  book and the bluebook give us a number of tool to assess that risk  and if the  book forecast  with a monetari polici path close to what   s price in the market  show a differ trajectori of output growth and a differ trajectori of inflat  then there would be more substanti reason for us to be concern that the path that   s rough price in now creat too much risk that we would be push demand growth below potenti over the period   and  again  i think it is hard to say that   it has been said that the output base polici author for public releas    of     rule we use aren   t a particular good reason to be concern about that becaus of the way they are construct  are we too hostag to the market in our current approach   i think that is alway someth to be worri about   again  the best check against that risk is to look at the implic of these altern polici path for the forecast   i think it   s hard to find in the rang of path that the staff has given us signific justif for concern against that risk today  so i would support move    today  and for the reason discuss  i think b   a pretti good job of captur the basic object of a signal that   s fair neutral to expect   i   d rather take the risk at the margin that we   re push it up a bit than the risk that we end up push it down
thank you   thank you for this veri help convers   it help inform today   s decis and also help inform how we will be think about polici for the next few meet  as i discuss  i see the economi as still be basic quit strong  and it need to moder to becom consist with it long run potenti   the vehicl by which that is go to happen is the slow in the hous market   i think we ought to rais the rate today and not to signal an immedi end for sever reason   first  we could think of our polici in term of the mortgag rate rather than the fund rate   the mortgag rate is current about the same as it was when we began tighten in june       and it is still provid support to the hous market   if we fail to act today or signal that we are definit done  we would creat a ralli in the long term bond market and in the mortgag market   we would creat  i think  some risk of re ignit what is current a cool market   i think that would be a mistak   second  i talk  as mani of us did  about the small but nevertheless probabl risk that inflat will rise slight in the next few author for public releas    of     quarter and the potenti cost of that to our credibl and to our futur polici need to respond to higher inflat  so my recommend to the committe is that we rais the feder fund rate target    basi point today   we are circul  and you have receiv  a draft statement that is veri close to option b  which i   ll discuss in just a moment   what i would like to emphas is that section    which say that polici firm may be need is in fact a flexibl statement  and i think it   s entir possibl  depend on the interven data and the evolut of the economi  that we may choos to signal a halt or even to not move in may   it depend veri much on what we see in the hous market  what we see in the economi  and what we see in the inflat data   so i believ this   creat signific flexibl  a coupl of other comment   first  i realiz that there are argument on both side about expand even modest the languag in the rational   i think this languag is not more explicit or lengthier than the languag we have seen in some statement that this committe has issu in the past few year   it has the benefit in this particular case of slight moder the hawkish tone of the statement and of acknowledg that we see  for exampl  the economi to be return to a sustain pace   so i think it   serv some purpos  and i think it is worth includ  i appreci presid pool   s suggest  but i do not think that the minut and the statement are perfect substitut   the statement  after all  is much more  e  and it repres someth closer to a consensus or a median view of the committe as oppos to the minut  which tri to express the rang of view and discuss around the tabl  one other suggest about retain or take part   from statement a   i see the argument on both side   but i think the sens around the tabl is that the chang was not suffici to justifi the innov to the januari statement  and so i think we ought to stay with the januari languag  author for public releas    of     if you look at the statement  it is veri close to b   we did make a coupl of chang suggest by presid    which i think clarifi what we are tri to say   in particular  in the middl paragraph      the price of energi and other commod appear to have     are the subject and the verb mismatch        the run up       appear to have onli a modest effect     and    product gain have help to hold the growth of unit labor cost in check      so we are obvious not rule out other influenc that are import  so that is my propos   that we move    basi point today  that we issu the statement you have befor you  and that we watch veri care the data dure the intermeet period   the bluebook present a number of option   type of languag that would allow us to paus  to paus with an upward bias  to move and paus  various combin   so i think we do have quit a bit of flexibl when we come back to meet in may  we have alreadi had a polici go round   so i don   t want to do that all again  but if there is anyon who particular would like to comment  here   s your chanc   yes  presid
i agre with the statement   but just on presid pool   s suggest for put those four point in the minut  i want to say that i don   t think we should do it   i don   t know what the process here would be   i mean  i don   t think we should say that the accommod has been larg remov in the minut  which will come out three week after this meet and three week befor the may meet   i don   t see ani benefit to it
it illustr the differ between the minut and the statement   the statement is a consensus view or at least a median view   the minut should express the rang of opinion and would includ that view but perhap other view as well   are there ani other comment   are we readi for a vote  author for public releas    of

thank you   we need to take an action   there will be a short break   recess
all right   we would like to return to the meet and discuss briefli the format of today   s meet  and also we need to make a few decis about what we   re go to do in may     is go to introduc the discuss
the next item on the agenda call for us to address the date of the next meet  which the chairman has indic that he wish to confirm for wednesday  may      more broad  howev  this is an opportun  while memori    the materi use by ms    are append to this transcript  appendix     author for public releas    of     are still veri fresh  to review the experi of this meet and to think about possibl enhanc to the format of futur meet   in the past for the fomc  various format have been use   just for exampl  in term of the two day schedul  the fomc introduc two day meet back in      becaus it felt that it need addit  e everi so often to take a longer term perspect on polici   thus  dure the mid     s  when the committe was meet about month  three or four or as mani as five of those meet each year were two day affair   more recent  sinc       the committe has consist held two two day meet each year  schedul to coincid with the feder reserv   s semiannu report to the congress   to help focus your comment about the current meet  we distribut at the break a list of question you may wish to address in ani comment you may have  befor hear those comment  though  i want to mention what i think is the baselin assumpt about the path forward after today regard the meet schedul   first  the committe will meet for one day next  e  just as origin plan  becaus the  e of intern meet in may make it difficult to turn that meet into a two day one   of cours  if it would be help  that may meet could be schedul to begin a littl earli  say      in the morn  to give you addit  e   then  in june  the committe alreadi has a two day meet schedul   at that point  have had some more experi with this format  the committe might be prepar to decid whether to shift most of it remain      meet to a two day format   as     s memo from earlier this month point out  your septemb meet will have to be confin to one day  again larg becaus of the intern meet schedul   but the august  the octob  and the decemb meet could be expand to an addit day if you wish   around the  e of the june meet each year is when we would typic be publish the tentat schedul for meet for the follow year   for       in this case   but that announc could alway be delay a littl this year to allow for  e to decid on the use of the two day format  and ani chang to the      schedul could then be announc at the same  e
we   re open for comment on the format or suggest for the futur   presid guynn
i like what we did   there   s a lot to like about the last two day   i think we ought to give ourselv sever two day meet and see if we can get realli comfort with the notion   i certain felt more comfort   i detect comfort around the tabl   i still found the first go round a bit tedious   and if we   re go to realli have  e to probe  we need author for public releas    of     to find a way to shorten the statement part of that  so we don   t lose our focus   the split in the past  tri to cram into one day the econom outlook go round and the polici discuss was not the right balanc   the polici set is the most import part of what we do  and i realli like the notion today that we had a chanc to put it all togeth   so i guess  mr  chairman  my bottom line is that i   d like to see us continu to tri this two day format and see if we can   t make some of those thing even better as we have some experi
thank you   presid
i   m more or less in agreement with jack   s posit here   i thought this meet went extrem well   the format feel more comfort  and i think it will get more comfort as we get more use to it   in particular  the interact between peopl  which is a littl differ from what use to happen and i think is help   so i think that  in answer to the first question  the extra  e did enhanc the discuss and the interact was good  i like the separ of the econom and the polici discuss   i like be ask to formul my own idea about polici as oppos to react to a polici recommend   that was help for me in term of sort out my think  and i like that opportun   so i think it   s a separ that is worth preserv  in term of the  e that the meet take  if we get into a period of  e in which  as has not been unusu in my twelv year tenur  month go by and you   re basic monitor the data and everyth seem to be go pretti well  and you don   t need to move polici all that much  and we sort out this whole languag stuff  we may find ourselv in a situat that  sn   t requir the  e that the polici discuss requir today   so while i   m in favor of the flexibl that you get with the two day  we may find we don   t need it   and i hope we get there  author for public releas    of     so i   d be will to be a littl more flexibl   and i know we   ve got to put out date for the follow year   i think i   d rather go with someth that said mayb there will be three or four two day meet  if we have to put out a schedul in june  and see how that work for the next year  rather than make a statement that we   re go to do the same thing for some indefinit period of  e  i also think that in term of a one day meet   and we   ll definit have to have one in may and we   ll have one in septemb  and mayb we   ll have more than that if polici even out or the need for polici chang isn   t as great   i think we could clear start at      or even       we   re all up and about   asid from have a committe meet or someth earli in the morn  which i think is a good idea  to the extent we have committe meet around the open market committe  i think that by start at      or      we can use the morn  e more effect  get more interact  and extend the day and not bump into the       e frame   that   s all i have to say
first of all  i like the format much better   the fact that we have an opportun to express our opinion on polici befor we have to react to you   open the convers  and it   allow you to not feel that you have to get your polici in dure the initi go round   now  as to whether it   s one day or two day  i   m indiffer   if it work out that we like to have the addit  e the day befor  i   m fine with that   or we will find out next  e if we can have the differ format within one day   that will be fine as well   so i   m most impress with the differ format

i agre with everyth that cathi   said   i think she captur the reaction perfect  that this meet went veri well   this is a point in the cycl when our polici decis are particular difficult  but there have been mani  e when they have been no brainer   so maintain some flexibl to have one day meet when we don   t need the two day meet would be ideal  in term of start earli  just this morn we had a meet with susan on the basel issu   we had a breakfast upstair at       and i think we start at      and went to        you could easili just have a breakfast right here at      for those who want it and start the meet at        and the presid are all here anyway  so i don   t think ani of us would mind start that earli in the morn
yes  i applaud the meet format   i think it has gone realli well   i think you did a good job as interlocutor   is that how you say it    laughter   i hope in upcom meet that we can carv out a littl  e for understand our differ view about the structur of econom relationship that underli our polici view   and that would help take the polici discuss deeper than the level of whether you think the yield curv is too hot or too cold
i like the format of the meet for reason alreadi discuss   i would hate to lose the special topic that we have done twice a year   i think that   s what   was refer to   i think they have been veri valuabl   i   d also point out that there   s a practic problem   mani of the board of director of reserv bank meet the second thursday of the month  and a tuesday   wednesday schedul right ahead of that is not realli practic  author for public releas    of     richmond  in particular  has committe meet at the end of the afternoon on wednesday  some  we do at the st  loui fed as well   so although i think a tuesday   wednesday is a better schedul than monday   tuesday  it realli can   t be right up against the meet of the board of director
i was just go to add that i agre with everyon   s statement about the format   i like it   i thought split the polici from the econom go round was veri good   i was go to add what bill just mention   special topic   becaus i think that there are sever that we should give more  e to   so if we go to a two day meet format  there are go to be  e when our polici decis will requir more  e  but then we can use those other occas for the special topic   communic is one   inflat expect anoth   the list is veri long
thank you   governor bie
thank you  mr  chairman   i also like the format of this meet   we realli focus on the econom  and then we had more  e to talk about polici   and i hope that we stay with that format   but i also agre regard the special topic issu   talk about these topic   a lot   especi it give us background   what the staff led us through last summer regard hous has been veri import as we think about how to deal with hous market now   so i think that we need to keep those topic becaus they are the critic element of polici go forward and talk about them give us  e to think about them way ahead of when we may need to make a decis
i would just endors presid     s summari of reaction and the comment that have been made around the tabl   i think the innov in this meet have been author for public releas    of     excel   i think the meet has run veri well   have more  e has certain enrich the discuss of both the economi and the polici situat   i agre  too  with presid     s suggest that there will be  e when we probabl do not need two day   i have also been around through some calm  e  when there was just not that much to discuss on the polici front  and i think we need some flexibl   special topic  i complet agre  are veri  veri worthwhil  and i would not want to see them go   on the practic front  i would endors presid pool   s concern about conflict with board meet   you know  for me there would be no way of get back for wednesday afternoon   we begin our board meet on wednesday afternoon as well   so that   s a practic concern
thank you  mr  chairman   i would be comfort decid now that we are go to do two day meet as a matter of cours go forward  even though we may not want to fill the  e  in part becaus i think it   s import to give us  e to do special topic as mani of you have said   i would general be in favor of that   and i think we should figur out how to reconcil our director meet    calendar with that  i think the idea of separ the discuss about the outlook from polici is a good thing to do  but it   s a littl awkward to have these convers about the forecast without peopl actual reveal what their condit polici assumpt is  and it is slight artifici to separ them complet   so in some sens i think  as the  book    that we should all take on the oblig in talk about our view of the forecast and the outlook to be a littl more explicit about what we think at that stage is the condit assumpt of the polici   it  sn   t alway matter a lot  but it probabl   matter  author for public releas    of     in a two day meet  it   s probabl good to make sure that we have enough  e on the first day that everybodi has a chanc to do an initi statement   i think chop it up as we were forc to do today is a littl subop    it   s nicer to give everyon a chanc to put their basic view on the tabl at the begin  and that may requir  as tom said  that we all be a littl more select in how much we say in that initi round   it is in some way a better basi for give and take onc peopl have been abl to make their initi statement  compliment to dave   for the evolut in the  book present of altern scenario   i think that  as dave impli  there   s probabl room for further evolut in how the staff structur it contribut to the meet   as we think about it and as you point out  mr  chairman  how we think about evolut in our monetari polici regim and our communic regim  we should give some thought at this stage to what kind of support materi we want to have to underpin that evolut   i think that   s all i   ve got
thank you   presid
mr  chairman  i applaud the way this meet has been run   it was the most enjoy i   ve had in my long one year tenur   i do want to weigh in with some sympathi for those that come from the we n part of the unit state and have to go back for board meet  mayb we could front load these at the begin of the week and not lag them into wednesday  that would be appreci   second  on special topic  i want to underscor them and also suggest that the bank themselv have veri abl research staff  and we might call on their talent to make some of those present   it would  i think  be good for moral  but import it would round out viewpoint

thank you  mr  chairman   just to comment on two statement  one by presid hoenig and one by presid guynn   i would think we will learn a lot at the next meet as to whether or not by start earli we could do it in a singl day   as the discuss start ye day  it seem to me that we were in the old pattern of the work expand to fit the  e avail    laughter   it seem to me that the statement got longer  but i did not sens that they were ani more substant than they had been in other year   but i did like the fact that we had divid the discuss  and i like listen to the analysi befor i comment on the polici   the presumpt has been that we all come in here in a mode to learn   otherwis we can simpli e mail our result to you   so i like that divis  but i think we will learn a lot at the next meet
thank you   governor kohn
thank you  mr  chairman   i  like everyon els  thought this was a veri success meet  and i like the format veri much   the remark i was go to make is the one that governor olson just made  which is i think the may meet will be a nice test as to whether we can meet presid guynn   s plea for concis  and i understand that includ present compani   laughter
that was not what i was tri to say    laughter
i would like to comment on one part that other haven   t comment on  and that is the formul of the statement and the input of the statement   i like the idea that you and   were abl to work overnight to chang the statement slight to reflect the consensus around the tabl   i think the statement reflect the meet better than it would have if it were lock in concret befor we start   and i like the fact that it can be chang at the meet by the consensus of the meet   but  also  peopl were appropri  i think  restrain in their desir to make big chang in the statement  part lay down marker for futur statement  and that   s author for public releas    of     fine  too   so there   s a nice balanc between make chang and recogn that we can   t rewrit it at the tabl   but we can make it reflect the meet a littl better  particular with the interv between the econom and the polici discuss
presid  n
just a coupl of comment   i thought the format for this meet was excel  and it all went quit well   i would have a bias go forward toward two day meet  yes  there will be lot of  e when the immedi polici decis is straightforward and we won   t have to spend a lot of  e on it   but i think we will have more than enough topic that we are go to want to get into in some depth for quit some  e  especi if we start give serious thought to thing like inflat target and what we want our statement to say or not say  and so on and so forth   so i would start with that
i would just like to insert a comment   this wouldn   t necessarili have to be the way we did special topic  but special topic in the past were announc in januari and work on for four month   we receiv a ton of paper and stuff befor the meet   i think it would be hard to work in a special topic if the meet weren   t go to take up the whole  e   so we might have to think a littl and set out the two day meet   either that or go alway to a two day format  recogn that some of the  e we wouldn   t use it   i think there   s some slipperi there that need to be thought about more clear becaus you just cannot insert a special topic on the run   it take work
well  thank you for these comment   our next meet is perforc one day   i would move that we start at        so we will begin at      the next  e  nevertheless  given today   s meet  peopl are go to have to be conscious of  e and tri to be author for public releas    of     as concis and direct as possibl in your comment   i agre with vice chairman   that we should probabl have the experi of the one day meet  and perhap even as soon as next  e we can think about whether you   d like to make a chang in the calendar   let   s be prepar to do that  clear  one option in term of flexibl that presid   and other ask for is to have the possibl of a special topic at a two day meet when the busi  sn   t seem like to fill the whole meet   i think that rather than prepar six month in advanc  we could no doubt have some topic that are prepar on a shorter  e frame   they would be less intens   they could be join by the reserv bank as well as by the board   so that   s certain one option for us to think about if we want to go to a two day meet more often  not necessarili everi  e   but this has all been veri help  do we have ani other busi   so  we will meet at one o   clock for lunch to honor presid santomero  and the meet is adjourn   thank you veri much  end of meet author for public releas    of
